<p>Dear friends,</p><p>Last night was the finale of the first <a href="https://dandelion.earth/events/5fa133692fa741000d40acb8">Introduction to Crypto &amp; DeFi</a><strong> </strong>course, a four-week deep dive into the world of cryptocurrency and decentralised finance that I designed and teach. Here’s one piece of feedback that I received today:</p><blockquote><p>"I didn't really know what to expect, but I was very happy with this course.&nbsp;Both interesting and useful, which is a rare and precious thing in this world!&nbsp;The subject matter suited the Zoom medium very well, and the demonstration approach of actually going through the processes on-screen was the ideal way to teach them… The course flowed well, building on ideas in an engaging and easy-to-follow progression. Thank you very much – I got a lot out of this and greatly appreciate the care and intelligence put into its construction and delivery."</p></blockquote><p>I’m now looking forward to the <a href="https://dandelion.earth/events/5fa133692fa741000d40acb8">second course starting next week</a>. Sessions will take place 6pm-8pm UK time via Zoom on:</p><ul><li><p>Thursday 3rd December</p></li><li><p>Thursday 10th December</p></li><li><p>Thursday 17th December</p></li><li><p>Wednesday 23rd December</p></li></ul><p>If you can’t make a date, never fear: recordings are sent the same evening for you to watch at your leisure. Participants also receive 66 pages of comprehensive course notes.</p><p><a href="https://dandelion.earth/events/5fa133692fa741000d40acb8?ticket_type_id=5fc138f04717cb0017b4abb2">Receive £10 off the standard ticket price when booking via this link.</a></p><p>I hope to see some of you there!</p><p>Best,<br>Stephen</p><p></p>
