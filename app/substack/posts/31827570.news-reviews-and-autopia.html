<p>Dear subscribers,</p><p>No one turned up to today’s news review. This gave me some time to think about them and this newsletter.</p><p>The main intention behind the news reviews was to cultivate community around this newsletter. I believe this intention is now better served by <a href="http://autopia.co/">Autopia</a>. Thus I have decided to end the news reviews in connection with this newsletter (though I may in the future offer something similar under the Autopia name).</p><p><strong>If you are not yet a member of Autopia, I will offer you one-on-one support on getting set up with Metamask and send you 2.97 AUT tokens</strong> (the amount most people were airdropped, and enough to secure your membership to the Autopia community for the foreseeable future).</p><p>If you paid for a full year’s subscription to this newsletter and for whatever reason you are unsatisfied with this change, please let me know and I will happily offer you a pro-rata refund.</p><p>I look forward to seeing you in the Autopia Slack!</p><p>Best wishes,<br>Stephen</p>
