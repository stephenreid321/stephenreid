It's a process where our perception opens up to see the world around us in a poetic, sacred, or enchanted way, while feeling oneself within such a cosmos. Burbea describes it as \&quot;opening up the possibilities of seeing, of sensing, of really inhabiting a different cosmos,\&quot; allowing us to expand beyond conventional perception to recognize multiple dimensions or sacred qualities within our ordinary experience.\n\nKey Aspects of Cosmopoesis\n\nIt involves a spreading of the \&quot;imaginal sense\&quot; or \&quot;theophanic sense\&quot; from individual objects or beings to encompass the entire world or cosmos. When someone perceives a particular person, object, or experience as a theophany (a manifestation of the divine), this perception can spread to create a different sense of the entire cosmos.\n\nIt's a way of ensouling the world—perceiving the world as having multiple dimensions and levels of being beyond just the physical or material. This involves sensing that \&quot;selves, things, and world have their roots in, originate in, mirror or reflect, possess or are comprised of dimensions other than just the commonly agreed-upon dimension of materiality.\&quot;\n\nIt represents what Burbea calls a \&quot;vertical spectrum of the imaginal\&quot;—perceiving multiple dimensions or levels in the cosmos, not just horizontal interconnectedness at the physical level.\n\nIt provides a sense of meaningfulness and sacredness to existence that nourishes the soul. Burbea suggests that the soul needs this kind of multi-dimensional, poetic perception of the cosmos.\n\nIt's empty of inherent existence—like all perceptions, it's fabricated and dependent on the way of looking, but this doesn't make it less meaningful or valid.\n\nExamples of Cosmopoesis\n\nBurbea provides several rich examples of cosmopoesis from his own experience:\n\n1. The River Scene and \&quot;Day unto day uttereth speech\&quot;\n\nBurbea describes sitting by the River Dart on a beautiful autumn day. As he was taking in the beauty of the scene, a fragment from Thomas Merton came to mind: \&quot;Day unto day uttereth speech.\&quot; This poetic phrase triggered a sense of divine speech coming through nature. He experienced a deep sense of participation in the cosmos at multiple levels, not just at the physical level. The entire scene—the river, the trees, the falling autumn leaves—was perceived as divine speech, with Burbea himself participating in that expression. This wasn't merely a sensual appreciation of pretty colors or reflection on impermanence, but a profound sense of the cosmos speaking and Burbea participating in that sacred utterance.\n\n2. The Water Tap as Sacred Music\n\nAnother example involves Burbea sitting in the vegetable garden at Gaia House, reading. He heard what sounded like complex, skillful jazz music, only to realize it was actually the sound of water running through a tap at the other end of the garden. As he listened to this \&quot;music,\&quot; the entire garden became transfigured—not in its physical appearance, but in its essence. He perceived it as having a different substance, as existing at a different level. This wasn't merely seeing the garden as \&quot;heavenly\&quot; in a metaphorical sense, but actually perceiving it as a theophany, with multiple dimensions interfused with the physical. As Burbea describes it, \&quot;It appeared to be of a different substance, at a different level... It was heavenly, for sure, or divine.\&quot;\n\n3. Birdsong as Sacred Text\n\nWhile meditating, with what he describes as a \&quot;Jewish feeling\&quot; pervading his practice (triggered by reading about Jewish mysticism), Burbea experienced the birdsong outside his window as a sacred text—not metaphorically, but as an actual perception. This sacred text was \&quot;inexhaustible in depth and beauty.\&quot; When he opened his eyes, this perception spread to include the entire world and his own body as sacred text. This example illustrates how cosmopoesis often emerges from allowing various elements in meditation to unfold and interact, rather than dismissing them as distractions.\n\n4. The Jazz Music Cosmos\n\nIn a more complex example, Burbea describes how reading about a jazz saxophone teacher's musical concept led to improvisational music playing in his mind, followed by a dream about a jazz guitarist. These experiences triggered feelings of grief about his past life as a musician. Through working with these feelings and images in meditation, he eventually experienced a cosmopoesis where the world itself was perceived as music—not just hearing sounds as music, but experiencing all sensory perceptions (visual forms, colors, tactile sensations) as music. As he describes it, \&quot;the whole of nature and the whole structure of nature was music.\&quot; This wasn't a metaphor but a direct perception of \&quot;another dimension to existence.\&quot;\n\nThese examples illustrate how cosmopoesis emerges in various ways—often triggered by small perceptual shifts, words, or memories—and how it transforms one's entire sense of the cosmos from something merely physical to something multi-dimensional, sacred, and infused with meaning. As Burbea emphasizes, these are not merely metaphorical ways of speaking about experience but actual perceptions that open up different dimensions of reality.\n\n(co-authored with Claude 3.7, based on the 5-part ‘A Sacred Universe: Insight, Theophany, Cosmopoesis’ in the Path of the Imaginal retreat, Aug 2015 https://hermesamara.org/resources/all/retreat/Path%20of%20the%20Imaginal)&quot;,&quot;body_json&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;doc&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;paragraph&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;marks&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;bold&quot;}],&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Cosmopoesis&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;, as articulated by Rob Burbea, refers to a way of perceiving and experiencing the world as sacred or divine—a creative opening of possibilities in how we see, sense, and experience the cosmos.
