<p>Dear friends,</p><p>I am thrilled to announce the <a href="https://lifeaspractice.com/">Life as Practice Yearlong Group Mentorship</a>, that I’m hosting alongside my partner Laura.</p><p>We've created this offering to complement the transformative power of retreats, recognising that equally profound growth can happen in the context of daily life when supported by community and skilled guidance. This year-long journey weaves together meditation, movement, learning, creative expression, and self-reflection, all held within a container that honours natural cycles and provides both accountability and flexibility. Laura and I have poured our combined experience in facilitation, coaching and contemplative practice into designing something we wish had existed for us, and we can't wait to meet the group that comes together around it.</p><p><em>Apply by June 30 to secure the early bird rate and save up to €1000.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://lifeaspractice.com/" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png" width="1200" height="630" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:699133,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://lifeaspractice.com/&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://stephenreid.substack.com/i/162542732?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F986aa0eb-8be1-49dc-88fa-70d9891559e5_1200x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>What if everyday life could become your practice ground for profound growth and transformation? How would it feel to intentionally weave meditation, movement, learning, creativity, and self-reflection into the rhythm of your days? What aspects of your authentic self would unfold if supported by dedicated mentors and a like-minded community for a full year?</strong></p><p>You are warmly invited to <em>Life as Practice</em>, a unique year-long group mentorship guided by Stockholm-based couple <strong>Stephen Reid and Laura Gottlieb</strong>. Running from September 2025 to August 2026, this immersive container is designed to help you integrate personal development into your daily existence, transforming routine into ritual and challenges into catalysts for growth. It’s a journey into living more consciously and embodying your practice fully, within a supportive community structure.</p><p>At the heart of the journey lies the <em>Fivefold Focus,</em> a holistic framework designed to cultivate well-being and growth across key dimensions of your life. This structure ensures a balanced approach, encouraging you to engage deeply with: <strong>Meditating</strong>, developing focus and insight through stillness; <strong>Moving</strong>, nurturing your physical vitality through consistent embodied practice; <strong>Learning</strong>, expanding your mind with curated readings and memory techniques; <strong>Creating</strong>, expressing your unique gifts through a personal project aided by cutting-edge tools; and <strong>Reflecting</strong>, deepening self-awareness through regular journaling. These five pillars form the core activities that will ground your practice throughout the year.</p><p>Holding and supporting this deep work is the <em>Fivefold Container</em>, the carefully crafted structure that provides rhythm, connection, and guidance throughout the year: <strong>Full Moon Meetings</strong> bring the entire group together for shared learning and guest insights; <strong>New Moon Pods</strong> foster intimacy and peer support in smaller, rotating groups; <strong>Wheel of the Year Rituals</strong> connect our practice to natural cycles and punctuate the year with <em>adhiṭṭhāna</em> weeks of strong determination; dedicated <strong>one-on-one mentoring sessions</strong> with both Laura and Stephen offer personalised guidance; and the potential for an <strong>in-person co-created gathering</strong> provides an opportunity for deeper interpersonal connection.</p><p>Together, the <em>Fivefold Focus</em> and the <em>Fivefold Container</em> create a powerful synergy, guiding you towards meaningful growth while providing the structure and community to sustain it. This year-long commitment is an invitation to step into a more integrated way of being, where practice isn’t separate from everyday life, but the very way you engage with it.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://lifeaspractice.com/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Read more and apply&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://lifeaspractice.com/"><span>Read more and apply</span></a></p><p>Mettā,<br>Stephen</p>
