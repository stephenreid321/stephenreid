Thrilled to announce the Life as Practice Yearlong Group Mentorship, that I’m hosting alongside my partner Laura.

We've created this offering to complement the transformative power of retreats, recognising that equally profound growth can happen in the context of daily life when supported by community and skilled guidance. This year-long journey weaves together meditation, movement, learning, creative expression, and self-reflection, all held within a container that honours natural cycles and provides both accountability and flexibility. Laura and I have poured our combined experience in facilitation, coaching and contemplative practice into designing something we wish had existed for us, and we can't wait to meet the group that comes together around it.

How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?”

Linguistic aside: Something else I find interesting about this triangle is that the three countries speak three totally different languages.

- Swedish belongs to the **North Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family** , developing from Old Norse around 1225 CE, with Proto-Indo-European (spoken around 4500-2500 BCE) as its distant ancestor.

- Latvian is part of the **Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family** , emerging as a distinct language around the 16th century, sharing Proto-Indo-European as its ultimate ancestor with Swedish.

- Finnish belongs to the **Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family** , diverging around 1000 CE from its earlier form, with Proto-Uralic (spoken around 4000-2000 BCE) as its ancestral language; Finnish and the Indo-European languages last shared a common ancestor possibly 15,000+ years ago, if at all.

Finnish is as different to Swedish and Latvian as they are to Japanese, Mandarin Chinese or Arabic, representing entirely separate language families with fundamentally different grammatical structures, vocabulary roots, and linguistic evolution 🤯

[Mar 27](https://substack.com/@stephenreid/note/c-103851019?)

[Stephen Reid In Correspondence](https://stephenreid.substack.com)

**Cosmopoesis** , as articulated by Rob Burbea, refers to a way of perceiving and experiencing the world as sacred or divine—a creative opening of possibilities in how we see, sense, and experience the cosmos. It's a process where our perception opens up to see the world around us in a poetic, sacred, or enchanted way, while feeling oneself within such a cosmos. Burbea describes it as "opening up the possibilities of seeing, of sensing, of really inhabiting a different cosmos," allowing us to expand beyond conventional perception to recognize multiple dimensions or sacred qualities within our ordinary experience.

**Key Aspects of Cosmopoesis**

1. It involves a spreading of the "imaginal sense" or "theophanic sense" from individual objects or beings to encompass the entire world or cosmos. When someone perceives a particular person, object, or experience as a theophany (a manifestation of the divine), this perception can spread to create a different sense of the entire cosmos.

2. It's a way of ensouling the world—perceiving the world as having multiple dimensions and levels of being beyond just the physical or material. This involves sensing that "selves, things, and world have their roots in, originate in, mirror or reflect, possess or are comprised of dimensions other than just the commonly agreed-upon dimension of materiality."

3. It represents what Burbea calls a "vertical spectrum of the imaginal"—perceiving multiple dimensions or levels in the cosmos, not just horizontal interconnectedness at the physical level.

4. It provides a sense of meaningfulness and sacredness to existence that nourishes the soul. Burbea suggests that the soul needs this kind of multi-dimensional, poetic perception of the cosmos.

5. It's empty of inherent existence—like all perceptions, it's fabricated and dependent on the way of looking, but this doesn't make it less meaningful or valid.

**Examples of Cosmopoesis**

Burbea provides several rich examples of cosmopoesis from his own experience:

**1. The River Scene and "Day unto day uttereth speech"**

Burbea describes sitting by the River Dart on a beautiful autumn day. As he was taking in the beauty of the scene, a fragment from Thomas Merton came to mind: "Day unto day uttereth speech." This poetic phrase triggered a sense of divine speech coming through nature. He experienced a deep sense of participation in the cosmos at multiple levels, not just at the physical level. The entire scene—the river, the trees, the falling autumn leaves—was perceived as divine speech, with Burbea himself participating in that expression. This wasn't merely a sensual appreciation of pretty colors or reflection on impermanence, but a profound sense of the cosmos speaking and Burbea participating in that sacred utterance.

**2. The Water Tap as Sacred Music**

Another example involves Burbea sitting in the vegetable garden at Gaia House, reading. He heard what sounded like complex, skillful jazz music, only to realize it was actually the sound of water running through a tap at the other end of the garden. As he listened to this "music," the entire garden became transfigured—not in its physical appearance, but in its essence. He perceived it as having a different substance, as existing at a different level. This wasn't merely seeing the garden as "heavenly" in a metaphorical sense, but actually perceiving it as a theophany, with multiple dimensions interfused with the physical. As Burbea describes it, "It appeared to be of a different substance, at a different level... It was heavenly, for sure, or divine."

**3. Birdsong as Sacred Text**

While meditating, with what he describes as a "Jewish feeling" pervading his practice (triggered by reading about Jewish mysticism), Burbea experienced the birdsong outside his window as a sacred text—not metaphorically, but as an actual perception. This sacred text was "inexhaustible in depth and beauty." When he opened his eyes, this perception spread to include the entire world and his own body as sacred text. This example illustrates how cosmopoesis often emerges from allowing various elements in meditation to unfold and interact, rather than dismissing them as distractions.

**4. The Jazz Music Cosmos**

In a more complex example, Burbea describes how reading about a jazz saxophone teacher's musical concept led to improvisational music playing in his mind, followed by a dream about a jazz guitarist. These experiences triggered feelings of grief about his past life as a musician. Through working with these feelings and images in meditation, he eventually experienced a cosmopoesis where the world itself was perceived as music—not just hearing sounds as music, but experiencing all sensory perceptions (visual forms, colors, tactile sensations) as music. As he describes it, "the whole of nature and the whole structure of nature was music." This wasn't a metaphor but a direct perception of "another dimension to existence."

These examples illustrate how cosmopoesis emerges in various ways—often triggered by small perceptual shifts, words, or memories—and how it transforms one's entire sense of the cosmos from something merely physical to something multi-dimensional, sacred, and infused with meaning. As Burbea emphasizes, these are not merely metaphorical ways of speaking about experience but actual perceptions that open up different dimensions of reality.

[Stephen Reid In Correspondence](https://stephenreid.substack.com)

I’ve been struck by the resonances between these three contemporary bodies of work on soul:

- Rob Burbea’s **Soulmaking**

- Bill Plotkin’s **Soulcraft**

- Cynthia Bourgeault’s **’Soulseeing’** , a term coined here to refer to her work in The Eye of the Heart

While these approaches emerged from different traditions, they share a common concern with soul development and deeper spiritual perception beyond conventional understanding. Each offers unique insights into human potential and spiritual maturation.

**Core Concepts**

**Rob Burbea's Soulmaking**

Rob Burbea (1965-2020), a British meditation teacher in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, developed Soulmaking as part of his "Imaginal Practice." Burbea's approach brings elements of Western romanticism, depth psychology, and Buddhist meditation together in a unique synthesis.

Key elements:

- Views perception as a creative act rather than passive reception

- Emphasizes the "imaginal realm" as a domain between pure spirit and material reality

- Introduces "soul-making" as the art of cultivating meaningful relationships with images, archetypes, and concepts

- Incorporates meditation practices that use imagery and emotion to deepen spiritual experience

- Challenges rigid notions of "emptiness" in Buddhism by introducing a more romantic, image-rich spirituality

**Bill Plotkin's Soulcraft**

Bill Plotkin, an ecopsychologist and wilderness guide, developed Soulcraft as a nature-based approach to spiritual development and psychological wholeness. His work draws heavily on wilderness experiences, depth psychology, and indigenous traditions.

Key elements:

- Centers wilderness immersion as a catalyst for spiritual transformation

- Presents a developmental model of eight life stages or "soulcentric" development

- Emphasizes discovering one's unique "soul purpose" or ecological niche in the world

- Utilizes nature-based rituals, solo wilderness quests, and dream work

- Distinguishes between ego development and soul development

- Incorporates a strong ecological consciousness and earth-centered spirituality

**Cynthia Bourgeault's Soulseeing (The Eye of the Heart)**

Cynthia Bourgeault, an Episcopal priest and contemplative teacher, presents spiritual perception through what she calls "the eye of the heart" in her work. Her approach is grounded in Christian mysticism, particularly the Wisdom tradition.

Key elements:

- Explores multiple realms of consciousness beyond the material world

- Describes the "eye of the heart" as a spiritual organ of perception

- Draws on the Christian mystical tradition, particularly Wisdom Christianity

- Emphasizes contemplative practices like Centering Prayer

- Integrates teachings from G.I. Gurdjieff and other esoteric traditions

- Presents a cosmic vision of multiple interconnected realms of being

**Key Similarities**

**1. Beyond Materialism**

All three approaches challenge materialist worldviews and recognize realms of existence beyond the physical. Each teacher presents a cosmology that includes subtle or non-physical dimensions that interact with the material world.

Burbea speaks of the "imaginal realm," Plotkin discusses the "soul realm" and mythic dimensions, and Bourgeault elaborates on multiple "worlds" or planes of consciousness. All three reject the notion that physical reality is all that exists.

**2. Integration of Multiple Traditions**

Each teacher draws from diverse spiritual and philosophical sources:

- Burbea combines Buddhist meditation with Western romanticism and Jungian psychology

- Plotkin integrates indigenous wisdom, depth psychology, and nature-based spirituality

- Bourgeault weaves together Christian mysticism, Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings, and perennial wisdom

This cross-pollination allows each approach to transcend the limitations of any single tradition.

**3. Emphasis on Direct Experience**

All three frameworks prioritize experiential knowledge over intellectual understanding. Each offers specific practices designed to cultivate direct perception of subtle realities:

- Burbea's imaginal practices and meditation techniques

- Plotkin's wilderness quests and nature-based rituals

- Bourgeault's contemplative practices and Centering Prayer

They share a conviction that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient for spiritual transformation.

**4. Soul as Central Concept**

Despite differences in how they define it, all three approaches place the concept of "soul" at the center of their teachings:

- For Burbea, soul emerges through the creative relationship between consciousness and images/archetypes

- For Plotkin, soul represents one's unique ecological niche and deeper identity beyond ego

- For Bourgeault, soul functions as an intermediary between spirit and matter, with unique capacities for perception

Each sees soul development as essential to human fulfillment and spiritual maturity.

**5. Developmental Perspective**

All three frameworks present spiritual growth as a developmental process with distinct stages or phases:

- Burbea describes progressive stages of imaginal practice and perception

- Plotkin outlines eight stages of soulcentric development

- Bourgeault presents spiritual evolution across multiple lifetimes and realms

They share the view that spiritual maturation follows recognizable patterns rather than being entirely idiosyncratic.

**Key Differences**

**1. Relationship to Religious Traditions**

The approaches differ significantly in their relationship to established religious traditions:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** emerges from Buddhism but deliberately moves beyond orthodox Buddhist frameworks, incorporating Western romantic elements that traditional Buddhism might consider problematic. His approach could be seen as post-Buddhist or trans-Buddhist.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** stands largely outside formal religious traditions, drawing more from depth psychology, indigenous wisdom, and direct nature connection. While spiritually rich, it functions more as an alternative to conventional religion.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** remains firmly rooted within Christianity, specifically working to revitalize Christian mysticism through the Wisdom tradition. She operates as a reformer within her tradition rather than establishing something separate.

**2. Role of Nature**

The three approaches assign different significance to the natural world:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** primarily works with internal imagery and meditation, with nature sometimes serving as material for imaginal practice but not essential to the method.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** places wilderness at its very center, considering direct encounters with wild nature as irreplaceable catalysts for soul development. Nature isn't just a setting but an active participant in transformation.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** acknowledges nature's importance but focuses more on subtle realms accessed through contemplative practice rather than wilderness immersion.

**3. Primary Practices**

Each framework emphasizes different primary practices:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** centers on meditation practices that engage imagery, emotion, and meaning-making. His approach requires developing sophisticated meditation skills.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** employs wilderness-based rituals, solo quests, dream work, and council practices. Physical engagement with landscapes is fundamental.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** prioritizes contemplative practices like Centering Prayer, along with embodied awareness exercises derived from Gurdjieff's work.

**4. Cosmological Scope**

The frameworks differ in their cosmological breadth:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** focuses primarily on the relationship between consciousness and the imaginal realm, with less emphasis on elaborating a complete multi-realm cosmology.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** presents a relatively earth-centered cosmology focused on human development within the context of Gaia or Earth consciousness.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** offers the most explicitly detailed multi-realm cosmology, describing specific "worlds" or planes of consciousness and their interactions.

**5. Orientation to Psychological Healing**

The approaches differ in how they relate to psychological healing:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** acknowledges psychological aspects but ultimately aims beyond psychology toward spiritual insight and perception.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** directly addresses psychological healing as integral to soul development, with clear therapeutic elements throughout his work.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** tends to emphasize spiritual transformation over psychological healing, though she acknowledges psychological work may be necessary groundwork.

**Synthesis and Contemporary Relevance**

These three approaches represent significant innovations in contemporary spirituality, each responding to modern challenges in unique ways:

- **Burbea's Soulmaking** reimagines spiritual practice as the active co-creation of meaning through consciousness engaging with imagery and archetypes, transcending both rigid doctrines and materialist limitations.

- **Plotkin's Soulcraft** responds to ecological crisis and cultural disconnection from nature by reconnecting human development to the more-than-human world.

- **Bourgeault's Soulseeing** revitalizes ancient wisdom traditions for contemporary practitioners while preserving their essential depth and mystical dimensions.

Together, they demonstrate the continued evolution of spiritual thought in the 21st century, showing how ancient wisdom can be reimagined for our time without sacrificing depth or transformative power. Each offers valuable tools for navigating an increasingly complex world while maintaining connection to deeper sources of meaning and purpose.

’s essay and 
[Emil Ejner Friis](https://substack.com/profile/8128552-emil-ejner-friis)
’s note wrestle with the central tension facing metamodern communities: the gap between contemplative self-development and tangible socio-political action. Rowson frames the Emerge network as an "incipient field" that has found itself but now needs to mature beyond its "honeymoon period" to confront real-world power structures and generate collective impact. Similarly, Friis challenges the "liminal web" to evolve beyond what he characterizes as "bourgeois escapism" and private enlightenment pursuits toward genuine societal transformation. Both writers recognize the metamodern scene's unique capacity to perceive connections between disparate renewal efforts and to operate "between worlds," while also acknowledging that without institutional tenacity and political engagement, these communities risk becoming self-referential bubbles of "social reverie." The parallel questioning of whether these networks can transcend their comfortable theorizing to affect systemic change reveals a shared understanding that the field stands at a crucial inflection point where it must define its relationship to power and politics.

[Feb 12](https://substack.com/@stephenreid/note/c-93020595?)

[Stephen Reid In Correspondence](https://stephenreid.substack.com)

Imagine a world breathing with life, vibrant and resilient. Cities are not concrete jungles, but verdant ecosystems, interwoven with nature. Buildings rise like sculpted trees, their surfaces alive with vertical gardens and solar panels seamlessly integrated into their design. Food is grown locally, in rooftop farms and community plots, nourishing bodies with a richness and diversity long forgotten. Energy flows from renewable sources, decentralized and democratically controlled, empowering communities to be self-sufficient.

But this is not a retreat to the past. This is a future where technology, guided by deep wisdom and a profound respect for life, amplifies human potential and fosters interconnectedness. The digital realm is not a separate, distracting space, but an extension of our natural world, a tool for connection, learning, and collaboration. Open, secure, and decentralized networks form the backbone of communication, ensuring privacy and freedom from manipulation.

Imagine walking down a street, your personalized AI assistant, not a disembodied voice, but a subtle presence integrated into your awareness, whispering suggestions based on real-time data – the healthiest restaurant option, a hidden park nearby, a potential collaborator with shared interests. It connects you, not to a curated feed of fleeting distractions, but to a rich tapestry of human experience.

Education is no longer about rote memorization, but about cultivating curiosity, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. Children learn through immersive experiences, guided by mentors and aided by technology that enhances, rather than replaces, human interaction. Elders are revered, not for their age alone, but for the wisdom they embody, their stories woven into the fabric of community life.

Healthcare focuses not just on treating disease, but on fostering holistic well-being. Advanced diagnostics, powered by open-source AI and decentralized data sharing, detect potential problems long before they manifest. Personalized treatments, tailored to individual needs and drawing on both ancient wisdom and cutting-edge science, support the body's natural healing processes. Pandemics are a distant memory, thanks to robust, decentralized bio-defense systems and a global commitment to preventative measures.

The relentless pursuit of economic growth at all costs has been replaced by a deeper understanding of prosperity. We measure progress not by GDP, but by the well-being of people and the planet. Businesses are not driven solely by profit, but by a commitment to serving the common good. Resources are shared equitably, and a global network of collaborative platforms ensures that everyone has access to the tools and knowledge they need to thrive.

Conflicts still arise, but they are addressed not through brute force, but through dialogue, empathy, and a commitment to finding solutions that benefit all parties. The digital realm, once a breeding ground for division and misinformation, now fosters understanding and connection. Advanced cryptographic tools protect our privacy and security, while sophisticated algorithms help us navigate the complexities of information, filtering out noise and highlighting diverse perspectives.

Humanity has not retreated from the stars, but our exploration is guided by a sense of humility and respect for the vastness and mystery of the universe. We seek not to conquer or exploit, but to learn, to connect, and to contribute to the unfolding story of life.

This is not a utopia, free from challenges or imperfections. It is a world _in progress_, a world constantly evolving, adapting, and learning. It is a world where technology serves as a powerful tool for enhancing life, not replacing it. It is a world where the wisdom of ancient traditions and the innovation of modern science are woven together, creating a tapestry of thriving that is both resilient and beautiful. It is a world where human potential is unleashed, not for the sake of endless growth, but for the sake of a deeper, richer, and more meaningful existence for all beings, a world in harmony with itself and the cosmos. It is a world built not on extraction and domination, but on regeneration, collaboration, and a profound sense of interconnectedness – a world truly worth striving for.

Got tipped off that my Technological Metamodernism course notes are doing the rounds amongst the Russian-speaking community! “The best intellectual product that appeared last year in the field of technological sense-making is Stephen Reid’s four-week course ‘Technological Metamodernism’. A real underground post-cyberpunk.”

Full translation below…

**Технологический метамодернизм**

Лучший интеллектуальный продукт, появившийся в прошлом году в сфере технологического _sense-making'а_ — это четырёхнедельный курс **Стивена Рида** _«Technological Metamodernism»_. Настоящий андеграундный посткиберпанк.

Я сильно удивился, когда открыл его для себя пару месяцев назад, поскольку в то время как раз делал наброски своих занятий по схожей теме и общий подход, как и выборка рассматриваемых проектов / персоналий / мемэкосистем получался у меня очень похоже. И для меня это вау-радостный опыт, когда случается открывать ребят настолько комплементарных по интересам и вайбу.

**Основное содержание курса:**

\* Первая неделя: введение в метамодернизм

\* Вторая неделя: метамодернистский взгляд на технологии

\* Третья неделя: технологический метамодернизм, миф и магия

\* Четвертая неделя: метамодерн и будущее технологий

Всё это опирается на околинтегральные фреймы (метамодернисты, Ханзи Фрайнахт, Зак Стейн, Марк Гафни и т.д.), охватывает почти всё, что обсуждалось в _tpot_ в последний год — аккселерационизм, думеризм, децентрализацию, измененные состояния техники и сознания, регенеративные культуры, техношаманизм, _wise_ инновации и многое другое. Плюс Рид приглашал много замечательных людей — исследователей и активистов, которым есть что сказать по существу за пределами стандартного набора нарративов.

И как настоящий посткиберпанковый околоинтегральный метамодернистский продукт, курс полностью доступен в открытом доступе:

\* объявление о релизе курса

\* силлабус в Google Docs на 191 страницу — совершенно уникальная кладезь самых актуальных знаний [docs.google.com/documen…](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3xYCTvdNcmEgtjeSavCuAehrVmDN_RhJTqoRZ-ZzlM/edit?tab=t.0)

Technological Metamodernism

The best intellectual product that appeared last year in the field of technological sense-making is Stephen Reid’s four-week course "Technological Metamodernism". A real underground post-cyberpunk.

I was very surprised when I discovered it for myself a couple of months ago, because at that time I was just sketching out my classes on a similar topic and the general approach, as well as the selection of projects / personalities / meme ecosystems under consideration, turned out to be very similar. And for me it is a wow-joyful experience when I happen to discover guys who are so complementary in interests and vibe.

The main content of the course:

\* Week 1: Introduction to metamodernism

\* Week 2: Metamodernist view of technology

\* Week 3: Technological metamodernism, myth and magic

\* Week 4: Metamodernism and the future of technology

All of this is based on the peri-integral frames (metamodernists, Hansi Freinacht, Zach Stein, Marc Gafni, etc.), covers almost everything that has been discussed in tpot in the last year - accelerationism, doomerism, decentralization, altered states of technology and consciousness, regenerative cultures, technoshamanism, wise innovation and much more. Plus Reid invited many wonderful people - researchers and activists who have something to say on the substance beyond the standard set of narratives.

And as a true post-cyberpunk near-integral metamodernist product, the course is fully available in the public domain:

[Stephen Reid](https://substack.com/@stephenreid?)
[Jan 17](https://substack.com/@stephenreid/note/c-86736918?)

[Stephen Reid In Correspondence](https://stephenreid.substack.com)

From [x.com/\_LouiePeters](http://x.com/_LouiePeters) - if this is correct, things are going to get crazy, fast:

“Why did o3 make such rapid gains over o1?

I think it is due to a new **recursive feedback loop** between test time compute capability and distillation of test time capability gains back into the original base model.

This is a consequence of 3 key takeaways from AI/LLM progress the last 2 years:

A) Model distillation for LLMs works very well (and, relatedly, synthetic data can work very well)

B) We found a new training objective (learning an intuition for navigating full trees of possible Chains of Thought, described below) which for the first time allows RL to scale in training and leads to models with increased output diversity that can 1) scale inference time compute effectively and 2) scale synthetic data further without collapsing

C) Scaling inference time compute leads to predictably higher model capability

This leads to the feedback loop.

Model distillation allows a more capable model to teach a less capable student model and significantly close the capability gap between them.

But now we don’t need to use a more capable base model; we can just use the same model with its test time compute–scaled capability boost to teach its own base model.

This creates a new model v2 that starts from a higher base of capabilities; but again we can predictably increase these via inference scaling. A test time–boosted v2 can then be used to teach itself via model diffusion, leading to v3. And so on.

Separate to this feedback loop, we also have easy wins from scaling RL training data and flops much further. Next token prediction pre-training compute scaling still works as well, but it doesn’t currently look like the highest capability return on compute investment compared to these new methods.”

cf. Stan Grof’s idea of psychedelics as “nonspecific amplifiers”

[

AI amplifies the intellectual capacities of its creator, the human collective. In fact, the “A” should probably stand for “amplified,” not “artificial.” AI certainly does amplify our intelligence, but it also amplifies our stupidity, our insanity, our disconnection, and the consequences of our errors. We must understand it in this way if we are to use it well.

[

So much of the clumsiness surrounding the integration of psychedelics into the American machine seems to fall back on this simple fact: We don’t understand mind. We haven’t sat long enough with the difficult questions of who and what we are to justify introducing these powerful, ancient technologies into our systems. This is not a call for moderation, and certainly not an effort to halt any progress that would counteract the obscene violence of prohibition. This is, simply, a cry for deeper contemplation of the ground in which we’re planting these seeds.

Thanks to those who donated in the OpenCivics Collaborative Research Round, I’m pleased to be able to open-source the notes from my recent Technological Metamodernism course.

I would say this is most important and cutting-edge course I’ve taught, bringing together ideas from technology, philosophy, design, game theory, mythology, speculative fiction and consciousness studies at a moment when AI and other emerging technologies are radically reshaping society.

Two of my projects have been accepted into ‘Quadratic Funding’ match funding rounds. Quadratic Funding is a type of match funding where the number of donations can matter as much as the amount, such that a single £/$/€ can be matched with many multiples of the donated amount.

**There's just two days left to donate!**

I would be enormously grateful if you would chip in just a few £/$/€, as your modest donation could be matched by a much greater amount.

Thanks in anticipation 🙏

I've always liked Substack. I've left Facebook, never posted regularly on Twitter and as much as I like Farcaster it still feels very niche. So maybe this is a reasonable place for short thoughts…
