Fussing with the word level of AI co-authored text feels a bit like pursuing photorealistic art after the invention of the camera. I mean, impressive that you can paint photorealistically, but I’d rather go look at impressionist, cubist art, or watch camera-based media like movies. If I want photorealism I’ll take or commission a photo.

**Cosmopoesis** , as articulated by Rob Burbea, refers to a way of perceiving and experiencing the world as sacred or divine—a creative opening of possibilities in how we see, sense, and experience the cosmos. It's a process where our perception opens up to see the world around us in a poetic, sacred, or enchanted way, while feeling oneself within such a cosmos. Burbea describes it as "opening up the possibilities of seeing, of sensing, of really inhabiting a different cosmos," allowing us to expand… [...]
