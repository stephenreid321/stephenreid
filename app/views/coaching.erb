          Working with Stephen was something else. He held space for me to tap into a truly authentic and deeply honest version of myself, and guided me through a journey that really helped me understand my values and how to use them to make challenging life decisions at a key inflection point in my life. I felt so "seen" by Stephen whenever we spoke: he both allowed me to be my complete self whilst also challenging me on some of the stories I was telling myself. I'd highly recommend Stephen as a coach and truly think he's one of the best people to have by your side through the ups the downs of life.

          I am not the kind of person who ever thought I needed a coach. I am super productive and good at making decisions but working with Stephen for a few months was transformative. Stephen has a magical ability to hold a safe space, ask the right questions and challenge. Working with him I reevaluated some of my limiting beliefs on scaling my business which has meant that this year business is booming! But he is also more than a business coach - he looks at the whole person. In our time together we dived into money, relationships and other areas of my life where I felt stuck. I would highly recommend working with Stephen. It might just change your life.

          I've admired Stephen's work from afar for several years now, since I heard about his Tools for Regenerative Renaissance course. I decided to work with him as a coach after realizing he managed to successful navigate a lot of the dimensions I deeply cared about: regeneration, technology, conscious sexuality, community. He not only helped inquire in ways that opened up my mind but also has a brilliant logical way of seeing things, breaking down complexity and making life seem easier. 
          Working with Stephen as a coach was a pleasure, I highly recommend it if you resonate with him and his work!
