There are times when teams get stuck, despite the best intentions of everyone involved. In these moments, external facilitation can be the catalyst for breakthroughs and renewed momentum. As an experienced facilitator, I offer a space for teams to step back, reflect, and engage in meaningful dialogue. My approach is tailored to unravel complex dynamics and guide teams towards clarity and cohesive action. Whether it's resolving conflicts, aligning on objectives, or simply finding a fresh perspective, I'm here to help you navigate through these challenges and emerge stronger and more united.

### Impact with Experience

Across my career I've co-founded and worked with a range of organisation types, including:

* <strong class="text-white">Worker co-operatives:</strong> I'm the co-founder of [Symbiota](https://symbiota.coop/), a not-for-profit worker co-operative that reaches over 70,000 people every month through its events brands.
* <strong class="text-white">Activist organisations:</strong> I co-founded [UK Uncut](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk-uncut), an anti-austerity movement with a reach of 50,000, and subsequently advised the Occupy movement and Extinction Rebellion.
* <strong class="text-white">NGOs and thinktanks:</strong> I was the network organiser for the [New Economy Organisers Network](https://www.neweconomyorganisers.org/), a key player in the [38 Degrees](https://38degrees.org.uk/) digital team during its period of fastest growth, and the youngest ever board member of [Greenpeace UK](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/).

My diverse experience is complemented by a highly technical background in artificial intelligence, complexity science and physics, an ICF Level 2 qualification in transformative coaching, and extensive meditative practice.
