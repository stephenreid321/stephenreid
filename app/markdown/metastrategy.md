The 'meta' in this strategy is that it scores *every coin* on ICONOMI according its weight across *all strategies* on the ICONOMI platform, further weighting by the performance of each strategy (excluding a small number of specified coins and strategies). It then takes the top 10 coins by score, and weights them according to their relative scores, with weekly rebalancing.

**Thus on any given day Metastrategy is a mix of the current top performing strategies.**

In pseudocode:

```
for each strategy
  for each coin in each strategy
    score_of_coin_i += coin_weight_in_strategy * performance_score_of_strategy
  end
end

sort coins by score
take top 10 coins by score
weight coins according to relative scores
```

For example, say there are two strategies, `A` and `B`.

`A` has coins <code>x<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>x<sub>2</sub></code>, <code>x<sub>3</sub></code>.

`B` has coins <code>x<sub>2</sub></code>, <code>x<sub>3</sub></code>, <code>x<sub>4</sub></code>.

The weight of coin <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> in strategy `Y` is <code>w<sup>Y</sup>(x<sub>i</sub>)</code>.

The performance score of strategy `Y` is <code>p<sup>Y</sup></code>.

Then the score of the coins <code>x<sub>1</sub>&hellip;x<sub>4</sub></code> is:

<code>S(x<sub>1</sub>) = w<sup>A</sup>(x<sub>1</sub>).p<sup>A</sup></code>

<code>S(x<sub>2</sub>) = w<sup>A</sup>(x<sub>2</sub>).p<sup>A</sup> + w<sup>B</sup>(x<sub>2</sub>).p<sup>B</sup></code>

<code>S(x<sub>3</sub>) = w<sup>A</sup>(x<sub>3</sub>).p<sup>A</sup> + w<sup>B</sup>(x<sub>3</sub>).p<sup>B</sup></code>

<code>S(x<sub>4</sub>) = w<sup>B</sup>(x<sub>4</sub>).p<sup>B</sup></code>

The performance score of a strategy  <code>p<sup>Y</sup></code> is calculated as

```
performance_score = (4 * 1_month_performance) + (3 * three_month_performance) + (2 * six_month_performance) + (1 * year_performance)
```
