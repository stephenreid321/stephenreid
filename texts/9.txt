[Music] there's a lot of work being done nowadays with psychedelic there's a rebirth in psychedelic therapy resuming and in the UK in particular that is being run by Robyn Carhartt Harris and mostly psilocybin why would psilocybin work for and they're using often to treat depression why would Silas ID and work for depression well so a primary question is why are we even looking at psychedelics so we're looking at succulents for two reasons one is that as I mentioned earlier mental illnesses burgeoning their society anxiety is the fastest growing diagnosis on both side of the Atlantic and more and more people are depressed and some of the reasons are mentioned in your on Irish about lost connections rate talks about just the loss of human communion which is not the only but sonia major factor so for social reasons mental illnesses or mental discomfort is rising number one number two there's the largely complete failure of the Western medical system in which I was trained and practiced to deal with the crisis of mental health we don't understand it I can go into the many reasons we misunderstand mental illness but fundamentally we're in denial about the unity of the human soul and the mind in the body and when denial about the social nature of human beings we live upon mental illnesses biological problems so people are looking for solutions outside the mainstream as they as they have to because within the mainstream their responses and the Prevention's are so nautical no psychedelics tell us I've been specifically but not exclusively get to a part of ourselves but usually we're not in Access of so they get to the unconscious part while we're conscious so we get the experience or unconscious while conscious and we can see what's in there now why on the physiological level the second let's do that I have to keep looking it up I just I'm not keeping in my head that particular neuroscience and brain physiology that's involved but clearly parts of the brain are being activated that I usually are shut down or we have no access to and so psilocybin has been used in two ways it's been used as single fairly large dose experiences and through those experiences people get in touch with parts of themselves they usually have no access to for example they might have a deep spiritual experience a deep experience of unity a deep experience of the true self part of their real sub that usually are shut down from their daily experience well that could be tremendously healing but what if I no longer saw myself as an isolated little ant crawling around for survival in this huge ant heap but as a meaningful and genuine part of a larger whole and that unity is unshakable no matter what happens to me and no matter what I feel at a particular moment but if I could be conscious of that unity if it gives you a totally different experience of life so along with other psychedelics like a cell step you can do that and what's striking is that it doesn't matter what the psychedelic experience when people describe their experience of unity it's all the same language and it's all the same language if people get there without psychedelics so either everybody's hallucinating and everybody's crazy or they're having some genuine experience of something that's deeper than our usual consciousness can permit and that's what happens I believe it's either silent then people also use it and this is still experimental on a micro level where people are not using it to have this deep experience in fact I might have a an amount that doesn't even give them an altered consciousness in a short-term but over a couple of weeks micro dosing with am I used four to three days and then not used for a few days but in a small barely perceptible those yet alters their being physiology in such a way that they're no longer addicted any image case they're using it like an antidepressant the difference is that I'm to use that every day they use small quantities and they don't have side effects which and I've taken antidepressants I'm not against them but you know they do come with side effects sometimes and what are the risks of this kind of therapy well the risk is really only that if people have experiences they can handle and leave them on board so these expenses these plants traditionally and the mushrooms have been traditionally by native peoples ayahuasca has been used traditionally by native peoples iboga has been traditionally by native peoples in Africa and Latin America and North America peyote and so on but there's always in a context always under the guidance of very experienced elders who'd been through their own experience now in our world mattenderle canavan ik is taken individualistic sometimes people might use these substances who are not ready for it who've not been prepared for it and it might release emotions and visions in them that they don't know how to integrate in our handle so I've seen a few people lose it as a result of psychedelic experiences I've not seen personally I don't know of some but I'm not seeing any tragic outcomes but I've seen some difficult outcomes so the risk is using it when you're not prepared and not under appropriate guidance now some of these substances should also not be used with certain people with various mental health conditions for example if you have a history of mania you better not use Iowa I don't think because it can trigger your mania or LSD for that matter unless she was working with somebody was very confident and can be with you over time and integrate and hold whatever happens to you so again it depends on context but there are certain kind of indications because obviously there was a huge enthusiasm for these substances in the 50s and 60s there was a lot of really amazing and very promising work going on and then the entire field was shut down what do you think of the lessons that can be learned from that to avoid something like that happening again so in the fifties and sixties two kinds of work occurred with the psychedelic the first work which preceded the second was very responsible scientific research work and some very important work was done develop see for example in Canada and in North America and perhaps elsewhere where they found some very positive results and its impact on mental illness that was scientific work very rigorous Emira its flaws but the intentions were purely to advance science and human health that then got coupled in the 60s for the cultural explosion of psychedelics with the anti-vietnam war movement the whole alienation between generations that became very apparent in the 60s the whole mistrust of tradition and elder guidance not to mention the mass of the experience need to escape from the rigidity of the mainstream culture a lot of young people were involved in he was using psychedelics not traditionally not under guidance and certainly not under any kind of scientific inspiration so a lot of people used it and there was a lot of negative experiences there were people who saw it off the top of buildings only the impact of LSD thinking they could fly and of course finding out that they couldn't really fly some people went insane using these psychedelics again because they weren't using in my context for the right indications with the right guidance the mainstream ideologues and politicians scientific figures who were suspicious of psychedelics in the first place and who didn't like this happening that didn't occur under their control in the first place then either in they were inspired by these missteps or used them as an excuse to clamp down on the whole field of psychedelic research so there's a retrenchment and a giving up of some very useful avenues of inquiry that persisted for decades until again the cultural crisis and the general inadequacy of mainstream medical perspectives led to a resurgence which is what we're seeing now and for the most part what we're seeing now is much more scientific and much more responsible use of these substances with some of the dangers that also attended it in the sixties ago and one of the other the fact that they're becoming much more mainstream or one of the other areas of concern I know for some in the psychedelic community is that we now have corporate interest we've got companies coming in that are monetizing this are you concerned about that well just a reality the fact any economic system is that the economically dominant ones that will derive the profits from almost anything that's popular that just how it works so cannabis is being legalized in Canada now it's not only the little growers there's no really profit it's gonna be huge corporations they're gonna take advantage of the tax structure and the whole economic setup to make enormous profits that's just how it works the thing with the psychedelics saith ayahuasca it's not a product that people will use everyday so when you make prozac people have to use it daily in fact they use it daily for years now ask us something love ceremonies with two or three times a year if your devotee if you're a follower so it's not as profitable because you don't get to sell mass products to a large number of people on a daily basis so there's less risk with that but if psilocybin becomes useful as I say as a micro dose I can see corporations moving in under the system I expect nothing else it's less amenable to that kind of profit motive because of the more intermittent nature of these experiences and the small quantities involved but nothing is immune to profit and it is a profit to be made yes I expect the corporations to take advantage just going back to a psychedelic therapy is there a sense that we can get insight from from these experiences but ultimately we have to do the work ourselves of integration and healing well yeah I've had deep experiences with psychedelics really deep insights I thought I understood the world and I talked about this maybe 10 years ago I let every treated ayahuasca and under the impact of the plant I was really a girl I mean I was really right on I was you know insightful and compassionate and I could see through people's stuff and I would guide them to reality and I thought ok hey I've made it folks then I'll arrive home and my wife just picks it up at the train station and she just had a haircut that story upset by all sudden life wasn't worth living because of this haircut that bad bad wife had so there's that this is unlike my god you know that's all of a sudden I look at my partner and I don't like what I see an awesome I get all this kondal a discombobulated that's my particular neuroses but that dioica experience and all the answers I had they not liberate me from my neuroses or having to have my woman looking a certain way that's a dependent I still was so the greatest insights and experiences legion nowhere unless you integrate them and as you say that integration takes work and so what I've learned and what I emphasize more and more not affect when I'm said most now is the experience opens the door but you're the one has to walk through the door and having the window open or the door open does not get you to the other side and that's a lot of work and so it's like with every other kind of spiritual work you can also have great realizations on a meditation question and people do have these direct experiences of godhood but it is them nowhere unless it transformed their lives and for the trance on their lives those intentions and those insights those intuitions need to be integrated and that's the daily work and there's nothing that stops me so there I reckon I to say people if it's a question of having great insights on the one hand or daily regular work on the other choose the daily work forget the great insights forget the great experiences no if you can combine the two powerful support one for the other but the work is the key can you describe what that work is the work made me different for everybody excuse me but it does involve some disengagement from the daily grind some time that's devoted to your core essence or to exploring it so for me and if my ADHD I was never a great meditator I mean I could sit to an inundation cushion and if I was present for 10 seconds out of 20 minutes I could declare victory however I've also thought I wasn't a yoga person but two years ago I found a yoga practice but if I don't do daily now I suffer and I do do it it is supports me it puts me in touch with my body it stills my mind and it provides a break to my constantly running a going mind so that experience myself as somebody different than just somebody was always engaged in thought and talk and and and and in process so that's my particular way journaling which is observing yourself in writing about it so that there's that observer self that you're actually strengthening an observer self is not the same as the daily rattled ordinary self good work the Buddha talked about the Dharma the Sun that the dyma know the Buddha the Dharma and the Sun the Buddha meaning our inner two cells the Dhamma being the path the Sangha being community all you have in contact with others who are on the same path or do you just belong to a bunch of Facebook groups we discuss or the odds of life star city winning the the FA Cup again you know so is there some connection with others who are on the same path for some people will be meditation for some people will be communing with nature for some people it'll be revisiting the psychedelic experience but without the plant without the drug without the substance just putting himself in a space in the databases some kind of olive or some kind of practice some kind of practice which has to be regular your work with ayahuasca and curious as to well at in fact for any any listeners who aren't familiar with ayahuasca what the experience is you give a short summary of what experientially what happens in an ayahuasca ceremony well speaking of meaning it wasn't as ayahuasca I'll come to that one moment it was when another plant called iboga that I participating in a ceremony earlier this year and somebody asked me what is the meaning of life and and the this is what I was under the effect and the immediate answer that came up is life is its own meaning which I thought was a great line I don't know that I can live that in my regular existence but I thought it was the only answer that was needed but it takes a lot to recognize that life isn't on me now yes after my book on addiction came out you just be published in England but in North America it appeared ten years ago I kept getting a lot of questions about what I knew about psychedelic plants particularly ayahuasca and the treatment of addiction and mansur was I knew nothing at all until the answer in fact I should say the question became somewhat annoying to me because I just spent three years writing a book how about asking me something I knew about rather than this is one thing I didn't know but it so happened that I was exposed to the plant and I'd opportunity to experience its impact myself and at the first use of the plant within a ceremony led by a Peruvian shaman I understood why people were curious about its potential to work with addiction because it provided a deep root to my own soul and to my heart and also allowed me to observe just how close my heart had been and of course the dictions are all about shutting down some parts of ourselves that we would then have to enliven through artificial means I was called this particular plant also sometimes gives people a deep sense of their own suffering of what is it that they've been running from all of our lives the addiction is all about running away it's a temporary running away for something unbearable which is that simple and the plant shows you what you be running from which can be painful and difficult but it shows you in a very compassionate way so both in the sense of connecting into a deep core self that doesn't have to run anywhere and in terms of showing just what you've been running away from it can be a deep experience in the right context yeah I mean I found from my own experiences many of them have been a sense of compassion combined with a lot of pain but I'm really interested in this idea of around especially the the severely addicted people in the beginning of your book you know they it seems that their pain is just it's not they don't have the capacity to bear it well first of all none of us or they did have the capacity to bear pain otherwise it would be addicted the problem in addiction is not the pain the problems that we don't know how to bear it now why is it that we don't know how to bear it because the first time that we experience pain is in childhood now if a child experiences pain but there's adults there that can hold that child through that pain and and and show them that yes pain comes with it pain passes that child will not be traumatized the painful experience is not the same as being traumatized traumatizes when there's a restriction on our capacity to handle life and and the child that the infant whose mother's depressed for example the mother loved the child my mother loved me which was performing the best throughout my first year of life and terrorized for historical reasons she couldn't hold my pain she would hold me but she couldn't hold my pain it's for that she need to have something more than her own depression she needs to be present and feeling somewhat optimistic that ok kid young pain but it'll pass now the pan was depressed or stretched can't hold the child in their pain that child will not learn how to hold pain that child will only aren't going to escape from being to soothe it from suffering rocking masturbation eating and later on addictions so addictions are always about not knowing how to hold pain but the more severe the pain is and the more isolated the child is with the pain the greater the risk for addiction the cases I talked about in the beginning of the book the really severe drug as you said there were horrendous experiences and nobody to help them hold it hence their incapacity to hold a thing as you're talking about that I'm also reminded of you've talked a lot about H almaas spiritual teacher who's also been very influential on on my life and the concept of inquiry which is a big you know kind of going in and I suppose a talking meditation you you've mentioned that ayahuasca is you see it as a process of inquiry as well and that that strikes me in some way because to be able to inquire into for example our pain or whatever it is comes with a sense of like implicit is a sense that I don't know and there's a kind of known as implicit sense that I don't know but there's also I'm going to find out and there's also somebody there who's going to find out here so pure pain if there's no sense of the experience or just you just want to escape from it but as soon as you say there's pain in me and I'm curious what that's about and I'm willing to look at it there's immediately a sense of the enquire which is no longer identified with the pain but is looking at it so that inquiry strengthens both our capacity to be with something and the person who is being with it and so for me the ayahuasca ceremony like many meditations is really an inquiry it's not about I won't have a beautiful experience of unity and godness and angels and entities and the stars which some people have I've never had one but it's about what's going to arise and how should I understand what arises yeah I'm struck by the difference between that way of approaching contact with someone or or ourselves and what we were talking about before with the very reactive nature of of social media yeah and you think by having those kind of dialogues with each other we can get somewhere you know get out of our box in a sense is there some healing and just being able to have conversations like that well so in the context of the ayahuasca ceremony at least the way I work with them there is contact before the seminary people share our purpose people indicate why they're there what they're looking for we help them identify their intention then is the ceremony and then after assembly once which people have slept and so on then we talk about what what did you experience and what meaning that you find it and then look over the meaning of the symbols that may be visited you know divisions that you experienced or the insights that you gained or the physical sensations that your body went through and having that conversation in the context of the group immediately allows everybody's experience to be accompanied and shared and it breaks through that isolation that's so many of us experienced and the people who have been struggling with addiction and gone through a ceremony what what kind of what kind of things are they reporting afterwards about what what they experienced and how are their lives afterwards well I've seen people break through significant addictions by means of I was the semis behavior addictions drug addictions and so on but it was cocaine or sex having said that the context and the follow-up and integration have to be there in other words for most people it's just not enough to have a beautiful experience of a deeply meaningful experience what are they gonna do with that in their lives that's a real an ideation and in the downtown east side of Vancouver which is a concentrated area of drug use right do spend quite some time in the book explaining and depicting the lives of these people these people come to ceremony they might have beautiful powerful insights and really get aspects of themselves that they've never experienced but then they go back to the Downtown Eastside there's no supportive context they'll relapse into their addiction and I've seen that so one mustn't idealize the ayahuasca experience is kind of the be-all and end-all there has to be a supportive ongoing integrative context so we talked about a h almaas and I'm curious how how has his work influenced your own approach to your work and maybe to your life as well I've had a number of I've never had a spiritual mentor does not be somebody that I've followed or but really join their group or or attending their teachings consistently might question why I haven't done that but basically I'm not a guru type but but that doesn't mean that I haven't learned from a lot of people I have animus hamid ali's his real name a charmer sis's non-deployment huge he's been a influential teacher in my life he's got these deep spiritual teachings which you have to say many of them I don't understand like he talks about stuff I have no idea about because he said he's a deep spiritual experiences of unity and transcendence that I haven't so the language he uses I can only wonder about having said that there's two major things that I've learned from him which are absolutely essential to my understanding one is the formation of the personality we tend to identify with the personality we think we are a personality all most points out through a combination of Western psychology and Eastern spiritual thought that the personality a false construct but the personality really is a defense against loss a defense against pain and so much of what we think of ourselves is actually a defensive structure and we mustn't take it to be a reality and that underneath the false personality the defensive personality there's a core self and that core self can recognize the falseness of the personality and can transcend it and he provides ways of working it through and so it's very sophisticated in in explaining the with a common unparalleled combination of Western psychology and Eastern spiritual experience the arising of the fourth personality in a kind of world that the false personality creates and how it keeps us track and at the same time or the personality does point to the truth in us because I think that the personality wants are real enough just like what the addiction wants is really enough I ask people what does the addiction gives you and they'll say comfort a peace of mind a connection with others a sense of control power while boasting the genuine qualities that people only want they actually have but because of the first personality false personality we lost contact with them so just as addiction points to the real human being so does the personality and imma show some ways are working with her and then again he he does talk about essence which is the true nature of all of us that that underlies all our dysfunctions and our miss directions so in those senses and then his inquiry has been very inspiring to me so those are the main things I've learned from him again when he I don't stay wanders when he finds himself in more rarefied spiritual realms I don't follow him there I just haven't done that work I haven't had that experience but I do believe in that that he's talking about genuine human experience and his own experience the concept of essence and the false personalities is one of the most useful concepts for me from amis as well and I'm curious if you've if there was any sense when you were working especially down in some last question again was that down any side sorry so I'm I'm very curious you know this sense of essence for me for almost is very very real and I experienced that in myself and seen it seen it in others and I'm just wondering if Downtown Eastside in Vancouver working with the people you were working with whether there were moments where you could kind of see an essence in I could see it a lot of the time the tragedy is that the people themselves don't see it they don't see their own essence they're identified with their personality they identify with their drives and what their dysfunctions with their desperation that's what they're identified with and of course society for the most part mirrors back to them the negative sense of self in essence as almost acting points out needs to be seen in order to develop but I I've had more than a few glimpses of it and there's that tragedy between neither with somebody's essence and who they really are and then a level on which they function because they got cut off from their sense over there at least a connection distance long time ago dr.
