so obviously with the advent of the you know so-called intellectual dark web and the idea that there are many public into intellectuals yourself included that have been experiencing both height and prominence and controversy as we have kind of tried to wade into the culture wars and identity politics and all of the things that sort of have wrapped the the Western world around the axle lately what is your sense both of why that is happening now what are potentially some of the sort of evolutionary reasons for it and then also I mean and then let's try and explore together what's next we are built for the various canonical obstacles that we face in evolutionary history or we have faced what we don't realize is that we carry many latent programs for alternative circumstances programs that we may never encounter if the circumstances that they match never show up in our environment I would argue that one of these is for periods of austerity that in a period of economic contraction or its pre economic equivalent people go into a phase that's very tribal and they start looking around and thinking who's vulnerable who can't defend their stuff my people can afford to be a lot nicer to each other when there's plenty to go around because of growth or its equivalent but when that Peters out people start going after each other and we're in a very confusing phase because one of the things that tells you that you're in an economic contraction is just not enough food and we don't face that situation so in a sense even though we are in a contraction one of the signals that would cause people to go tribal has been suspended but others are beginning to kick in and there is a general sense in our culture that things are coming apart and that sense that things are coming apart have people looking for a kind of higher ground that will involve tribalism and will involve people doing things that violate the values they believe they hold and I think that's what we're seeing you either can move forward to kind of a more global perspective like we are all connected in some way or you can regress so it's progress or regress back to us know centric tribalism and obviously as we Teeter on this brink of saying hey the problems we face these days are no longer national they don't stop at borders whether it's refugees or climate or geopolitics or macroeconomics they they are complex ambiguous and transnational wish that it feels like we're being dragged into a global central awareness but it's also the transitional period - and just one more metaphor and mix it a little bit like being a soft-shell crab you know we've left the confining shell of nationalism and tribalism we are absolutely vulnerable in this transition and people are you know there's not necessarily a clear voice of leadership to get us all through that transition and into the more expansive container of we are all in this together so you have a lot of demagogues right and a lot of kind of so-called populism saying come back into the old shells you know divide rather than unite and I would just add that one thing you can do once you realize that that pattern is there is recognized that where this ends is not good unless we intervene so in other words this pattern of there's abundance abundance leads to certain kinds of willingness to interact broad-mindedness let's say then there's contraction and austerity and that results in a kind of tribalism this oscillation is going to kill us the solution to it the solution to it involves architecting a stable a steady state that gives us the inputs of abundance in a way that does not oscillate between boom and bust if you can create it looks like a world in which people have enough they have the sense that things are getting better because you've architected them to give people that sense of breadth in other words maybe you have shifted growth into a different mode in other words if everybody is freed to be generative so you're constantly encountering new interesting stuff that feels like the world of abundance that happens when you've just discovered some concentrated source of growth it may not be predicated on growth and that's the point is we're not in a position as human beings to track actual growth so if we can substitute things that feel like growth then we will put people into their growth mindset as it were and then they can't afford and they will naturally be inclined to be decent to each other what you're describing seems you know beautiful possible but wildly ambitious and we take a hell of a long time if it worked at all I mean like you are you talking about like a fundamental retooling of socio-economic structures and national stories and pervasive messaging and public sentiment all to the point where people like oh yes we can afford to be generous we can afford to be kind we can afford to be inclusive I'm talking about a process that will take three generations at least okay do we have that much time well let's put it this way you don't need to solve the entire problem at once you need to forestall the existential threats none of them can come to fruition if this project is to work so we have to wake up to those things that threaten us acutely and we have to begin addressing them that does not have to happen in exactly the same moment as people begin to feel a steady-state abundance but you do have to give them a burst of abundance in order to relax the tribalism that is setting in so the question is how do we get enough people to have a post global experience in order to annex global centric perspective and the only two options I can think of is either one independence day level stuff the discovery of other life something that really wakes us up to the fact that we are here together on this little blue marble and that's and that's the sort of search the astronaut's the the other is the you know or some form of Psychonauts some form of expansion in consciousness that you could scale rapidly relatively speaking within the span of a generation that gives people a post conventional global perspective in their interiors such that when we get back to start doing your longer a bigger harder project there are people who are actually holding that that beat there's several to the place you're talking about none of them are easy but they're relatively straightforward one thing is the fact that we have become an existential threat to ourselves slots in very nicely to the enemy that we face together all right we've seen the enemy it is us and so that awareness of that can I believe trigger the kind of unity that you're talking about the problem is that narrative which I believe is true we have become the existential threat to ourselves that narrative is in conflict with those who are most powerful in civilization who would like to keep it running as it is because it's feeding them pretty darn well so that story even though it should unify us it happens that there are a few holdouts and they're the most powerful people and they're selling a different story and also she feels like it requires a degree of radical self assessment to say it is us not to say it is them right the natural tendency is to see it as them but it is really it is us it is the processes that you know somehow keep this room temperate you know they're fueled by some power station somewhere that has implications so you know it is really us it's the processes that we are depending on that we don't see day to day but they're out there the other thing and you know and you you point to it I think you called it the psychonaut route into that sort of unity involves an Enlightenment and awakening to a deep truth and I the analogy I use as this if you discovered that you were a robot and that you were sent to I don't know assassinate some person who was innocent if you discovered that that was the explanation for you you would reject your program right you as the robot that had been given decency in order to get by everybody so you could commit your assassination would say actually I prioritize the values and I reject the mission that I've been sent on that's who we are we are that robot we are on a genetic mission that is absolutely unacceptable how would you how you just succinctly define that genetic mission that genetic mission just propagation and all propagation of your particular genetic Spelling's and here's the key it's a little subtle but if you and I have different spellings for a particular let's say a respiratory enzyme and let's say that respiratory enzyme functions better in you than in me it's ten percent more efficient my respiratory enzyme still wants your respiratory enzyme to go extinct because it doesn't care about the function it cares that that spelling is advanced and your spelling is in conflict with my spelling as long as yours is around there will be fewer copies of mine so our genomes are actually interested I mean that if I can just be clear about it the mindfuck of the whole thing is that the entire evolutionary story is the cosmic spelling bee and it ends in genocide right once you realize that that's what you are that you're built to advance your genetic Spelling's into the future generations irrespective of what they spell and that under circumstances like these we can afford to be decent to each other but if things were different one of us would be putting the other in a gas chamber no way I want no part of that and neither do you so when people realize that that's really what they are they are built to be nice when it makes sense to be nice and they're built to be Jenna Seidel in circumstances when genocide is the thing then the question is well all the things that you actually value how consistent are they with being that robot on that mission so it sounds like you are sort of saying at our route we are nasty brutish and short the old selfish gene kind of thing compared to some essentialist or triumphal s clearly you know it's very prevalent in the self-help popular psychology space we are on the frothy edge of realizing our true natures as you know spiritual beings blah Blee blah is that something you don't hold out hope for you feel like at root we are just self oriented robot programs is what's what's our shot at redemption that one it's easier it's easier than you would think because the fact is I'm telling you we are that robot on that mission once you know that that's your mission you could just reject it all right I'm not I'm not putting anybody in a gas I just won't do it alright I don't care about the genetic Spelling's at all and I really don't if I discovered that my sons were switched in the hospital at birth and they were not actually related to me it doesn't change my relationship to them it doesn't affect whether I love them I don't love them because they're genetic Spelling's so my point is we are actually evolution screwed up it handed us the tools to recognize that we don't have to value the game that it is playing and that we can now repurpose the hardware to something that's actually worthwhile and how liberating is that I mean who wants to walk around with bigotry yeah I mean it's funny cuz I mean that was just in my next book there's gonna be a section evolution is a moral and there's and no sooner do you realise that that you realized oh we are being nudged pushed and prodded into a whole lot of outcomes that create tons of pain in our psychosocial frameworks our value sets that are 100% wins on the evolutionary level yeah and tragic for us right and the the crazy thing is freedom from that is as close as just recognizing what it is and then saying well I mean I have a particular analogy I like there's this point at which pilot the pilot's name was Sully I guess captain Sully who landed the the plane on the Hudson is a point at which the birds have struck the engines and he needs to land the plane on the water and there's a good chance that he's gonna kill everybody on board but their best chance that they're gonna live is him right and he says my aircraft which is what you say when you take it away from the autopilot alright you take responsibility for it and the basic point is we need to look at evolution and we need to say my aircraft all right it's that simple
