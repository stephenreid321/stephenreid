there's no evidence that Cavanaugh was guilty apart from one woman's testimony why would she put herself through that she wasn't telling the truth the Democrats turned the whole process into a show trial Cavanaugh was far too partisan and angry in front of the committee you can't abandon the rule of law and submit to a mob mentality on the left David you all right so this is a kind of slightly experimental podcast based on how do you hold the possibility that both of those narratives are true at the same time because the reason we're doing this is because both Jordan Pederson and some of the other members of the intellectual dark web have had a lot of pushback for their comments on Cavanaugh especially Jordan Peterson which is the first time I think we've seen him like really under attack from his audience and he addressed it last night in his live event and it sort of feels it's an intro because this is what we've been talking about a lot in our podcast it's like how do you have a conversation that is not immediately reactive goes beyond polarization I think this is a really interesting cultural moment to do that yeah for me that's the most interesting question right now about how this is all played out with Peterson the Weinsteins and the reaction that they've had from within I'm not sure what one would call them they're fans or fans of the IDW in general but for me the whole point of the IDW is that you can have conversations in public it's a new way of having conversations and implicit in that is that you can have a conversation without it devolving into reactivity that's the entire point and so I was actually quite disappointed to see the fervor and the kind of angst enos and aggression that was coming from within you know the the same groups of people or the same people who've been supporting there was a lot more of a reactivity than I would have thought especially considering the entire point of this is to be able to think out loud in public in good faith which has not happened with this yeah Brett's wife Heather hiring put out a really interesting tweet which was you haven't demonstrated support for free speech until you defend speech that you hate and you haven't demonstrated support or an understanding of nuance and you defend it even when your side is winning and this whole idea about nuance I think is being able to hold contradictory thoughts that as Brett said in another tweet both of the outcomes are unacceptable and we're being presented by the system outcomes that are equally unacceptable like the Hillary Trump election I think was a kind of good example of that for this it's it's the idea that any allegation can destroy a man's career and needs to be believed absolutely and weaponization of those allegations is quite unacceptable and you can't run a society on that on that basis but equally this is and this is where I personally come down I'm going to sort of weighing up all the evidence the most why this is such a difficult situation is because the Supreme Court is supposed to be above politics and cavanaugh in his defense to the Senate explicitly made it political and attacked I'll read from her from his from his comment this whole two-week effort has been a calculated orchestrated political hit fueled with pent up anger about president Trump in the 2016 election fear that was at billons fairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups that may well all be true but he has to he is going to be on the Supreme Court which is going to have to rule on some of the most politically charged issues how can the Supreme Court when it is dragged into that debate be seen as any kind of arbiter and how do you pull out of this us and them mentality which is what I think Peterson was was alluding to when he said that he thought cabinet should withdraw I just want to go back to that point of nuance that Heather hiring had in her tweet which I thought was very good being able to just hold things without needing to find the right answer or the answer that confirms you know my previously held beliefs so obviously not always easy and I think with the the kavanah thing it's so emotionally charged that people lose their grounding very easily on both sides but that's the other point is that I think there's for all the flack that I'm guilty of this is Sahel okay all the flak directed towards the social justice warrior kind of attitude and you know the regressive left I see just as much reactivity from the right and that for me it's it's two sides of the same coin I think this has to be a resolution beyond that where it's a new genuinely what the IDW is is supposed to be about again a new way of thinking and I think part of that new way of thinking is also around taking responsibility for our emotions in the moment and probably not doing it online but that's another conversation to have yeah it's the other point that comes up as well like Peterson I think has been the main target of this because he has been identified as on one side of this culture divide and I think a lot of the people who are following him see him as an ally on that side of a culture divide like fighting back against identity politics and so he I think has suffered probably more than maybe Eric or Brett I mean they've got a lower profile anyway but they're not seen as figureheads for for something and but what's interesting is that I think when Peterson went on the marsh show and said we'll hang on how and you can't and they were there were a lot of people there being quite dismissive of Trump's of course and he said hang on you can't you can't just write off fifty percent of your people the same thing goes the other way and that's basically what is happening on the other side now is you've got to he was saying look you've got to build a dialogue with these people you've got to build a dialogue with Trump supporters if you're on if you're more on the kind of Hillary or the Democrat side well you can't if you support him in that message of yes well you've got to have these conversations you can't then turn around and say well actually no we just need to defeat these other people it's it's a contradiction otherwise you have a divided country and there is no way of pulling out of this tailspin of polarization I've read a few things actually suggesting that Eric and Brett and possibly Peterson as well that there was an intent I'm not sure it's true I think the interesting idea that there's kind of an intentional this was all intentional in order to in a sense reach out an olive branch and separate the wheat from the chaff of who interested in this purely because it happens to support their political agenda or Hugh's interested but they genuinely want another conversation I don't know but I think it's an interesting idea and what I think's interesting about it is that it does this process does in a way separate the wheat from the chaff of who's who's ready to leave ideology at the door to it agree to a large enough dick we all have an ideology or somewhere but to a large enough degree where you can listen to something that challenges you and go hmm yeah not sure but let's keep thinking and talking about it and that's also for people watching this it's like we're we're thinking aloud and it's an ongoing conversation I don't expect that what we're putting forward we're not saying this is the truth but we think it's a valuable addition we think this is a valuable cultural moment to be able to say how can we how can we see things from multiple perspectives in a way while holding on to truth while holding on to what is what is actually going on this other thing that that just I was reminded of is what I got a sense of but it was very interesting watching this be kind of the one of the first times that Peters Peterson gets a lot of flack from people who don't like him really the first time I can remember where he's gotten a lot of flack from people who do like him and it reminded me of well I - words like projection and rejection so as often in like couples therapies there's there's a it's quite normal that some in whatever kind of relationship there's a kind of moment where you're projecting all this stuff onto this person so maybe like oh she's the best woman in the world she's got all these qualities that actually are things that I'm painting onto her and then at some point there's a realization of like oh you're your own individual person and you're not actually a container for all my projections and you're not being the way I want you to be so I'm going to reject you and there's some element of that happening I think in in this whole conversation with the IDW in general with Peterson as probably inevitably what's going to happen at some point well especially if Peterson is carrying all of these kind of father projections from so many people it's like well daddy so something I don't agree with it's like a very difficult dynamic to be yeah to be exposed to so I think Brett Weinstein had the most interesting perspective of sort of meta perspective which is that when the environment is such that it selects for certain type of behaviors the people who thrive in environment other people that behave in that are not the kind of people who put national interest first for example they're the people who know how to play the polarization game like Kavanagh I mean Cavanaugh there was a most blatantly political speech by a kind of aspiring Supreme Court justice that anyone has ever heard so he played he deliberately played the political game looking to polarize knowing that the Republicans had that none those numbers and now he's a Supreme Court justice what that does to America going forward looks very dangerous from the outside if the Supreme Court is called in to adjudicate on an election for example how can it and here's the despite deciding vote how can half the country have confidence of that decision is being made for anything other than political reasons it just looks like it just looks like the an accelerating process and that's the concern that I think Brett probably has has the most interesting take on of where does this go going forward as this continues to spiral it really looks almost impossible for for anyone to come up to or if there's an interesting he also frames it in what an opportunity what an opportunity for someone to come in and be a hero that could have been Cavanaugh to say look I'm willing to I've been vindicated I but I put the national interest first but as Brett says the kind of people put the national interest first are not selected for in this environment so it's pretty scary
