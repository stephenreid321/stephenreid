Andrew Sweeney has written a lot about Jordan Peterson and I've made quite a few films about him since we started following Jordan Peterson he's been getting some quite intense criticism why I caught up with Andrew to talk it through I guess we've been engaging pretty deeply with his thought for quite a while and also reading a lot of the criticisms and come to a view about why it is that he provokes such a strong reaction among so many people and what that maybe says about his thoughts where and what it says about the culture at large what is it that he's saying that seems to be so indigestible for some people and is it and the parrot the great paradox as well as that he a lot of his thought talks about the necessity of talking with people who don't agree with the understanding that people have different views based on the temperaments and it seems to point a way to to getting past some of the divisions in the culture but the irony is he himself has seemed to be an incredibly divisive figure how do you make sense of that kind of paradox okay well I think the moment like the big moment right where all this began is the big gotcha moment and I don't mean with Kathy Newman I mean with Trump I think Trump was the gotcha moment for the culture right it was the moment when the progressive bubble burst it was the moment when the progressive got God and I so to speak right so I think it's I've been thinking about this in terms of you know how I was before Trump was elected and you could say I'm a I'm a sort of a political typical progressive you know with the lesbian mom and very much you know pro-environment the post-modern worldview there's something you know empty about it right but it's also I mean I've sort of framed it before as the hidden shadow of liberalism it's this kind of ideology of inclusivity that also is a tribalism that won't admit that it's a tribalism we are very very tolerant to to everybody except for traditionalists right because there's this terrible fear of traditionalism you know and conservatism there's this intense fear of progressives about religion do you consider Peterson to be I mean he's certainly arguing for traditionalist values but but I think there's something deeper like he's not and he's often seen by a lot of people that's the criticism he's a regressive he's he's knocking back so I I think actually what he's arguing for is a slightly deeper integration of traditional values my fence is with with Peterson is that he doesn't really fit into that culture war narrative so much he's he's looking to transcend it in some ways well exactly he's he's not a pure traditionalist right he's not a conservative you know in the purest sense of that world he's not arguing about going back to traditionalism he's arguing about transcending and including it to use Wilbur's language right he wants to rescue the father right at the bottom of the you know the whale this is always the mythological terms he is he wants to rescue this tradition no but he that he doesn't he doesn't he's not fully enclosed within it he's also a very open progressive you know person you know and he's also you know so I think the reason he's so much in the center of the discussion right now is that he can see all the way all the way down to the bottom right to the to the base of the culture and he can also see up right there's this verticality right of his thinking so he understood he understands that he understands the progressive view and he understands a postmodern view and he criticizes it's pathology right I very you know strongly that the postmodern view has become it's reached it's sort of maximum you know pathology it's become sick right he's not just theorizing about the world he's he's he's bringing an actual change to people's lives that that is that it is profound it just whether you agree with him or not like me I'm sure you've been accused of being a JP fanboy and I I've been really trying to engage with the criticisms that I found and to really interrogate my own view around him and try and understand where the criticisms are coming from and trying to sort of say well are there spaces that he's not seeing are there things that that he's wrong about because Oh on the overview if you look at something like maps of meaning and the Bible lectures and you really understand the the broader outlines of his thought there's something almost anti anti intellectual about it because almost everything he's saying is pointing back into the world in some way it's saying look you're already doing this look at the way your your systems your meaning systems work in the world look at the way you respond to this piece of art look at this way you respond to music and he's actually put putting pieces together so there's a kind of I find there's almost very little there's very little pure intellectual abstraction to argue with a lot of the time it seems to be pointing back into the world which i think is quite infuriating for the people arguing with him is that what he's saying seems a lot of what he's saying is is kind of unarguable and what I found in almost all of the the pieces of criticism of him or not without exception but but generally without exception is there's a real resentment in there and it comes out very very quickly when you're reading it it's either a sort of dismissiveness or saying oh he's got nothing worthwhile to say or or whatever and you and it's really what's also fascinating is that's a central part of his thought and a central part of his thought is to say pay attention to your resentment it's telling you something and the paradox is I'd say 95 percent if not more of the criticisms that I've read of him are permeated by this kind of resentment and it's it's really hard to get for me it's really hard to get beyond that to see whether they're saying anything worthwhile when when there's a clearly current some kind of a gender at play yeah the resentment I think comes from being a hyper intellectual right if you live in this theoretical world all the time you know if your world you know a couple of interviews are attacks on him i I've read we're very very sophisticated and there were there were a lot of good points there right what these people are extremely envious about and I would say Envy you know rent as you read says Envy is the one part of ourselves that we can't we can't really look at we're too if we're too afraid to admit that we're envious and jealous of somebody and that that that is our one of the biggest blind spots of human beings is envy and I believe this a lot of this the these hyper intellectual people who are living in very theoretical abstract you know universes and but at the same time they they've lost the ability to communicate with the order of the common man you know they've lost ability the ability to bring their wisdom you could say down from the mountain you know they're still up there in the absolute the world of abstraction right and they have an embodied their their wisdom so Peterson is a very embody type of type of thinker yeah this is really interesting that you make that connection to embodiment because this is where I think I resonated the most with Peterson because I've done a lot of sort of deep psychological work a lot of Jungian shadow work about integration of the shadow and that was really the subject of my first interview with him was I'd never heard anyone describe the process of personal integration as clearly as him and then to link that to this deep story of the of the logos more aligned with this sort of deep principle of Western culture this was really exciting for me and and suddenly started to make sense I mean I'd always done a lot of the work that I'd done in a slightly more I guess a more new-age kind of way of talking about spirituality and using young in in that way and then to hear that kind of really deeply connected to like the Christian story and the the it really felt I was grounding a lot of everything I knew everything I knew most certainly that I'd experienced myself and integrated myself and an embodied in my own life then suddenly had this intellectual construct that just as Peterson says about his lectures it just went click click click click click and I felt this sort of deeper intellectual integration with something I had already embodied and that's a that's a sense that I get I mean very few people I think are actually living a fully embodied and fully living out their philosophy in the world because it's such a difficult thing to do it's such a difficult like you say to look at your envi to look at your resentment to really admit that that you have it is a really difficult process yeah well I think that the shadow' notion is is absolutely essential right it's it's an essential notion right that needs to be reintroduced to the to the culture we need to stop looking for the shadow outside of ourselves you know we need to stop you know we need to stop with our categories of people being this or that and being bad and you know and our self-righteousness and our you know all of all of this and we need to admit in our cells that were also the worst person right he's bringing back traditional ism and mysticism into the conversation which is terrifying as hell for people yeah who have do believe that we've gone beyond that who we we've gone to a new level of society we we've gone beyond all these ignorant religions and all these ignorant traditions and now we are we're becoming more and more enlightened and progressive and they don't want to go back there and they don't want to look you know back into our origins but you know Peterson you know he says it's not capitalism it's it's deep in our origins where where where the shadow lives where you know so there's this unintegrated tradition in the culture right this this is a really profound point that that you mentioned before and I thought was really worth exploring about mysticism because there is something like even in the the Pankaj Mishra article where he talked about fascist mysticism this there is this huge fear among the sort of secular materialist classes of what this means to bring Europe from the depths for example to talk about the archetypal ground of religion to talk about the mythological structures because there is this sense that well we've we've we've got rid of that and that has a checkered history because there was something of the occult behind say the fascists for example there is some there is this sort of a cult tradition that feeds off its archetypal force of mythology and we've banished that but there's also a sense I think among a lot of people that in banishing that we've also banished spirituality we've also banished religion we've also banished some deep part of the human soul and maybe a lot of what we're seeing playing out in the culture right now the kind of is the end of the age of materialism we sort of get a sense of this multi-level crisis which comes from seeing the world as only a sort of set of material forces with no deeper soul or spirit and it's it told me you cannot sorry about that you continue you can't even see the word soul right it's it's taboo you can't even say the word sacred it's taboo you can't even talk about religion right you can't even have a discussion about it without offending a lot of people right yeah and this is this is something I think that uh a lot of people that I'm a lot of the networks that I'm part of talk about reanimating the world either Deep Ecology or some of these sort of forces of bringing a sense of the sacred back into public life or into into Western culture and then they can't but they can't get past their political response to Peterson to see that's exactly what he's doing and he is perhaps their best ally and the best exponent of this kind of reanimating of the sacred that you will ever that you will ever have and his success shows the thirst for the knit for that reanimation of the sacred can you talk about that kind of mysticism that he's bringing in fear that it brings up I've been practicing meditation for a while so so I I do actual spiritual practice why did they keep calling Peterson a fascist you know and why is because fascism I guess is a kind of you know dark mysticism mm-hmm and and perhaps they're legitimate to be to be afraid of this but again they're focusing on the pathology and they're not seeing the enlightened aspects of mysticism I mentioned this as a kind of a joke that he's transgender you know it's a joke and it's a provocation right because I've noticed that he you know the things he talks about her you know he talks about cleaning your room you know who cleans your room you know who tells you to clean your room your mother right you know he's he's very motherly he's very maternal with people he cries about young men you know he wants the best for you know he's very caring right he's very maternal but he's also very fierce and masculine so he's he's sort of integrated this masculine and feminine rather than being just a hyper masculine you know a chauvinistic man which a lot of people are accusing him of being he's integrated the male and the female which makes them very powerful and put some kind of in the center of both so he could he can talk to that he can he can he can communicate to both who men and both women to the left and the right you know he can have conversations with you know conservatives like Shapiro and he can also have conversations with you know left-wing people like Russell Brand Reich he can and and if he can so he sort of he's transgender in the sense that spiritually transgender in the sense that he's integrated the male and female inside of them and you know I I think I don't know if people have noticed this because he always being accused of being you know the patriarchy you know but I think he's like yeah I think he's much more postmodern than then then then he pretends to be or that he really is because he doesn't for example he doesn't go to church but he's trying to integrate the aspects of the Bible he doesn't again I said that's in the beginning I don't think he's a pure traditionalist what's really interesting for me from a very sort of broader cultural perspective is where it seems that we are in our attitude to religion because we had for a long time the the new atheist the Richard Dawkins and sam Harris were certainly dominant online and certainly very influential in kind of as the gatekeepers of the culture like in the kind of media world that I've been part of talking about religion talking about spirituality would always get you wouldn't get something commissioned because it's cynicism is a very easy position to defend oh no one sort of making those Commissioning decisions at any kind of channel would would want to open the door to religious or spiritual content whereas out it it really seems that with this kind of evolving conversation that Jordan Peterson is right at the center of there is a certain understanding of the function of religion even if you wanted to reframe it within a sort of more secular way of these are the best stories of how to live our lives that we've come up with and they're pointing to something that we can achieve in our own lives and there is there is seemingly a shift in that conversation around validity of religion and spiritual experience that seems to work very exciting to me yeah yeah because yeah result he's opening the black tide of mysticism right which this is what this is what Freud accused Jung of doing doing opening the black tide of mysticism right there's this terror of this right but there's also this incredible potential again it may be you could put it in this red religion you know category which was very I think I thought the blue church red religion categories of Jordan Curtin green Wallace's name are perfect really the red with the red red religion is is alive you know it's on fire and is dangerous but the blue religion is is suffocating and it's it's full of orthodoxies which you know and it's it becomes it's it's dead right it's a dead world whereas whereas you know Peterson's opening this flood of possibility in terms of you know well you know in terms of how we approach approach missus ism but also from a scientific point of view which is interesting for me because I wouldn't have naturally gone there myself
