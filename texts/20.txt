[Music] John real pleasure to speak to you from Toronto to London thank you for anyone who doesn't know you've been putting out a series called awakening from the meaning crisis for me it's probably the most excited I've felt it's a kind of intellectual journey since I discovered Jordan Peterson I guess a year and a half ago and what's kind of amazing about it is that you guys work in the same department yeah we're colleagues at the University of Toronto yeah so what are they put what are they putting in the water at the University of Toronto I'm not sure we just have a lot of really good people in that department and there are some similarities between your work and here's you both talk about meaning a lot you both talk about you're not afraid to kind of go into the mythological into the religious what would you say are the similarities and the differences between your work and his okay so some of the important similarities I think you put your finger on it very well I think we're both concerned with the issue of meaning and the meaning crisis I would I would claim in fact that I think a significant proportion of Jordans popularity is that he's talking about the meaning crisis because I think it's exigent right now and perhaps even urgent and we are interested in the role of myth and ritual Jordan is also I believe interested in altered states of consciousness so those are some of the significant similarities I would say and so we've we've shared a lot of students over the past years because of this we've spoken at multiple conferences together because of these shared interests Jordan also has an interest because I had a public debate with him if quite a while ago on what's called the frame problem which relates to the work I do on relevance realization so there's a shared interest there some of the main differences so Jordans framework is very largely from psychology personality theory and from psychodynamic background Union so I I know young and I've gone I went through Union therapy to get an inside understanding of it I've taken workshops and I do some relevant work around this so I have some understanding of it I don't have as expertise but that that is not the primary framework within at which I work there framework with within in which I work is very much a cognitive science framework so for your listeners who aren't familiar with it cognitive science is an interdisciplinary science it's designed to get the various discourses that talk about the mind at various levels like neuroscience the brain machine learning information processing psychology behavior linguistics language to get them all to talk to each other because they all use very different terminology different methods different different types of evidence so getting them all to talk to each other so we can get a better understanding of how these various different levels of the mind causally interact and constrain each other and also we can get a more coherent and clearer picture of mine rather than having this disparate disconnected discourses about the mind so I do a lot of work in cognitive science and I bring that framework to bear and then in connection with that I have I have multiple degrees in philosophy so I also bring in a philosophical framework especially through the Neoplatonic tradition in the West and the Buddhist tradition in the East I also I practice there's Buddhist practices I engage in and I teach the past non-meta and I also do Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong so I'm also have familiarity with Taoism so I have that as sort of a different background than Jordan I also I have a different take on certain aspects so areas where I think I would be in disagreement with Jordan is Jordan tends to pitch this as a political issue as a confrontation from ideologies I have sort of principled arguments against seeing it that way and trying to frame the meeting crisis that way so that's one area where I probably would significantly disagree with him on to try to respond to the meaning crisis that's really lots of really interesting things to pick up on there already and I mean this is something that we tried to do with rebel wisdom is to bring more of a kind of what is the meta crisis that is generating the political crisis rather than what is the political crisis per se because then you just get dragged into these very polarized debates very quickly I just want to sort of back up a little bit and just ask you what is the meaning crisis the symptoms are things we're talking about we've got you know incredible political adversarial and degenerative discourse we have the pervasive sense we talked about this Chris and Phillip and I in the book we actually measured it right of a sense of increasing in the society you know I use that term technically and we might want to talk about that at some point following on Frankfurt's seminal work on but the the the pervasive sense that is growing and becoming permeating our society and greater deep ingrained both detail and scope and the increasing the this weird the economy where everything is politicized but people are being politically disenfranchised they you know voting is going down participation in parties is going down you have disenfranchisement from established religious institutions you have a failing in faith in all in most of our political institutions definitely the legislative increasingly judicial law enforcement you have an increasing default existential stance of nihilism and cynicism often very shallow versions of this though as pervasive through the culture and this is also I would argue and I think others would agree with this exacerbating the mental health crisis so the addiction crisis opioid crisis things like that and how long would you say that the meaning crisis has been in production or how far back would you date it so that's that's a tricky question I think that so I talked about these three orders that helped to organize the various ways in which so when you study meeting in life people are sort of there they're trying to they need a framework to help them make sense they need a framework to help them connect to reality and connect to other people and they need a framework that gives them a sense of how to improve normatively self transcendence in some fashion and of course we had a framework with that it was it was a it was a grand synthesis right a sort of Christianity and Neoplatonism and that framework has collapsed and right in the face of a very powerful and I would also very important I am a scientist the scientific framework and so I think when we can start the dating of the meaning crisis and in both the 12th century believe it or not because that's when you see that framework start unraveling start to unravel and then that unraveling accelerates through time the Scientific Revolution the Protestant Reformation have a huge accelerating affects the Industrial Revolution as a huge accelerating effect and now of course the computer revolution right and the AI revolution are having accelerating effects social media so it starts I would say like in the 12th century but it's accelerating it's being massively accelerating I think especially in the last 20 years and just sort of going back to Jordan Peterson a little bit I think we spoke before we had a we had a zoo McCall a few days ago and you you kind of joked that Jordan Peterson was a gateway drug to your thinking yeah I I want it clear that you know Jordan has been very supportive of my work and so I don't want to in any way come off as dismissive of him Jordan is a very complex guy very complex thinker but what is typically happened at least in my anecdotal experiences people get interested in Jordan's work I have to be careful here there's a selection bias I'm only getting a certain a certain set but typically people have come out of you know a religious framework or an atheist framework they've gotten introduced to Jordans discussions about spirituality religion and mythology and the unconscious and then they come because they typically want something as I've mentioned earlier beyond the Union framework they want a way of incorporating that in two senses that I don't think Jordan talks about that I I can namely that whole cognitive scientific framework how do we bring our best cutting-edge cognitive science to bear on these issues so that we can integrate this understanding of spirituality with the scientific framework that's extremely important to me by the way this integration like like I talked about how cognitive science integrates across the disciplines it's very important to me that I integrate right I respect the differences but yet build a bridging vocabulary between what for lack of a better term spirituality and the scientific worldview and so that's one reason why they come to me the other reason is I mean I I teach you know the passion of meditation meta Tai Chi Chuan I teach you know I've taught within when I had a wisdom Sangha various you know stoic practices and cyclic technology so people also come to get you know well what do I actually train how do I practice transforming consciousness cognition character so that's how that's how that happens so I've heard you talk about cognitive science quite a lot and I wasn't familiar with the term before and I have to say it sounds like quite a boring term for something that when you talk about it sounds absolutely fascinating and and what I understand by it and correct me if I'm wrong is that it's and much of your work is about how we do things so it's just how we how we think rather than what we think and the content of what we think and actually it turns out that how we think is at least it important if not more important than what we're thinking that is a very astute way of putting it I really want to emphasize the process of how we make meaning as opposed to what that you know that meaning is its structures and things like I want to understand the how and I think this is directly relevant for example in one important way to the meaning crisis because knowledge is about what we know but wisdom is much more about how we know right and and so studying this how we know and how we make things relevant and how we form these connections and how we write make this obvious salience landscaping so that my actions and my thinking seemed just directly and intuitively appropriate to the circumstances that's exactly what I want to know and that's all relevant to wisdom we've had certainly had the sense since we started putting films out there that there's a real kind of intellectual awakening going on probably facilitated by the Internet and I guess since you've been putting out your your films as well you've got a sense that you've kind of started tapping into that as well what do you make of that what do you make of the kind of the sense that there is something happening so I find that very encouraging I mean I think part of the reason is like I said there I I do think I've arguments in evidence and and this is in self kind of evidence that there is a meaning crisis people are definitely searching and looking and there's also I think clear frustration with many of the answers that are on offer in the popular culture of the political arena even in sort of the established religions I want to be clear that I think there are people within the religious framework like Jonathan pezzo and Paul van der clay who are trying to I think I think they need to take more credit for what they're trying to do I think they're trying to do a very serious philosophical overhaul of Christianity to try and address this emerging crisis so there's other people doing all of this work so that so some of the factors there is a meeting crisis there's the frustration with sort of traditional established political and even religious responses there's already people out there who are doing this convergent work both within cognitive science and like I mentioned Jonathan and Paul doing the this philosophical restructuring or reframing of Christianity to address this crisis so III I'm much more hopeful about things now because sorry every academic thinks too highly of their own work so I'm trying to to be careful here but I do think it's plausible to assert that there is also a looming sense of crisis in general in our culture various interactions between you know socio-economic issues existential issues political issues and ecological issues and I think that's also driving this a sense of urgency and perhaps this sort of sense that there's a meta crisis that all of these other crises are actually a function of some kind of generator function the connection I think that you're pointing to I think is clear I'm not sure what the order of causation is I mean I'm a scientist so I worry about that I would say this I think I could say this without being in cautious the meaning crisis exacerbates and interacts with these other crisis crises in important ways I'm not sure what what's meta and what's not so but I get your point and I think looking for the interaction in that way is also something that I'm pursuing in the video series and in my work trying to get a sense of you know how does this cognitive cultural crisis interact with these other crises and and you know what are the lines of mutual and reinforcement to use some of the language we were talking about earlier how is all of this self-organizing and self-perpetuating because until we understand that we're going to have a very difficult time intervening you see the problem with self organizing systems think of your body it's an adaptive system it's highly self-organizing if it's perturbed if something times to destroy it part of what that self-organizing does is restructure itself to adapt you get a pathogen and your immune system kicks in use there's a change in your environment and your brain learns so self-organizing systems can restructure themselves to adapt to attempts to destroy them and if we don't understand the self-organizing the dynamics of the interaction of all these crises our attempts to intervene are one-shot attempts here and here and here I predict are going to constantly keep failing because this self-organizing process is going to adapt and preserve itself and this this kind of intellectual awakening that I've talked about a couple of times I think there's there's quite a few people who have a sense that this conversation there is an evolving conversation that is kind of headed somewhere and I think the sense of where people think feel that it's headed to is it is an integration of the spiritual traditions of the religious traditions in a meaningful way after the sort of the the overthrow of the kind of new atheist hegemony now there is a sense of again rather than kind of writing off all of these things as just sort of superstitions and things we've evolved past I put the potential for an integration of the world's wisdom traditions yes I I would agree that's it that is exactly how I would put it in what my sense of it is as well so I think what's happening is this integration and both sides are changing right so the way we're doing cognitive science in third generation this is the science side the way we're doing cognitive science and third generation cogs is very different from how we're doing it in first generation right and so the science is changing and the spirituality is they're starting to change in this reciprocal manner and so both are gonna have to give ground by the way I don't have a right term because the term I use it sounds dismissive I try to say I'm trying to salvage what I can from these axial age wisdom wisdom traditions these systemic sets of psycho technologies for transforming you know consciousness cognition character and community like those are powerful we have to salvage those and my reason for saying that is because they they they were born from an hour meshed in the axial revolution and it's in its two world mythology and all kinds of ways of trying to give us a grammar for thinking about self transcendence that do not mesh well do not fit well with the scientific worldview so all right for example I don't like nostalgic attempts to try and re-establish the two worldview but neither do i do Ally countenance as you would say this sort of the the rejection of all of this as sort of superstition garbage that so I'm trying I I asked my students who are from religions regularly and reliably do you find what I'm doing disrespectful and they say no you're being very respectful and what you're doing is valuable to to me and I think the fact that people like Jonathan and Paul find my work valuable he's also sort of support for that point but so try and not get the wrong connotations from this word but I am trying to salvage from those wisdom traditions right what we can't what we know and can learn about this meaning-making process and more especially and importantly how to engineer and create systemic sets of psycho technologies that afford the transformation and the transcendence that people are longing for that's what's very important we talked a minute ago about this sort of sense of this conversation moving somewhere and that there is a kind of potentially an integration I think that's what a lot of people feel excited by is this sense of that they can maybe not sense the destination but they can certainly sense that there is a trajectory to it what do you think that integration looks like this is what I argue and this one I'm going to argue in this series there's going to be two components to it right we're going to have a historical scientific argument that's why I spend half of the series on history and half of the sign of the series on cognitive science although they overlap in many ways right that is going to solve this problem right we have this wonderful scientific worldview and what we don't have is how we fit into that scientific worldview we do not have a scientific explanation of how we generate scientific explanations we do not have a scientific explanation of how we make the meaning systems that science presupposes when it pursues truth because you can't pursue truth if you don't have meaning right so we don't have how we fit into that we'll have an account of that but that's that and that account will hopefully stitch together all of those Cartesian divides my and embody mind in world development and function that we are talking about earlier but it will also help engineer sets of psycho technologies that have to do with something completely other so no not not completely - spoke something completely different see in addition to the historical forces that generate the meaning crisis I would argue there are perennial problems that beset us that there are remember we talked about how the meta crisis is self-organizing and that will that actually make it Swartz our attempts to intervene so in an analogous way the the complex self-organization that makes your cognition so adaptive also makes it perennial Eve ulnar abou - self-organizing complex processes of self-deception and self-destructive behavior these are perennial problems what I'm saying is perennial II because of right the kind of cognition and consciousness you have the very things that make the very factors that make your consciousness in your cognition adaptive make it perennial II susceptible and vulnerable to powerful forms of self-deception and self-destructive behavior and so we have always these problems and they can undermine our agency and undermine the meaning in our life in powerful and profound ways we can find ourselves caught up in addiction we can find ourselves beset by absurdities we can follow find ourselves a wash and despair so many of the wisdom traditions have the engineered psycho technologies for addressing those perennial problems and also affording the cultivation of self transcendence and wisdom so people can move to more optimal functioning and what I think the solution will look like is from the spiritual traditions we will get a lot of important tutoring guidance how to set up a culture like Steven batcher talks about a culture of awakening how to set up systematic sets of psycho technology we will learn a lot of the psycho engineering of the systematic sets of psycho technologies for addressing the perennial problems of despair and absurdity self-deception and affording the cultivation of wisdom and transcendence and that will mesh with this new scientific worldview which deal with the historical development that has led us to where we are now it will so back up all these Cartesian divides and we situate us back into a worldview and that's what I see coming together what do you think is the key piece that you're bringing do you think it is the cognitive science piece so I think for me the key piece is the cognitive science in one sense in that it's helping me to get an understanding of the meaning making and situate that into a scientific framework but also the cognitive science in its exemplification of a method of synoptic integration this method of the learning sort of the ontology the epistemology the terminology the methodology of different discourses and bridging between them I think that's a very relevant skill that is needed to bridge between sort of the scientific worldview and the the the the the world in which we find meaning and meaningful action and you mentioned before about the embodied brain this is something that it seems for quite a while I think there was a kind of Cartesian dualism or at least a kind of implicit Cartesian dualism how much has that been broken down now in in academia so one of the banner points of their generation cog Tsai is exactly the attempt to get rid of some of the the the I talked about it like in terms of like this grammar just caught this theoretical cultural grammar of how to think about the mind and its relationship to body in the mind its relationship to the world given to us by Descartes it's interesting because Descartes came up with all these dichotomies to try and address the meaning crisis that was being generated by the advent of the Scientific Revolution we should pay more attention I think to Spinoza because I think Spinoza gives a more comprehensive response nevertheless the old computational metaphor right think about it you're the saw we're and the hardware okay so your mind is the software and psychology studies that and your brains the hardware and neuroscience studies that right and so everybody gets to keep their job it's a great it's a great framework but when we move to this idea of cognition as inherently embodied in self-organizing right what happens is the divide between the software and the hardware it breaks down they become interpenetrating like in this idea of a Bioeconomy constraining how your cognition right is attending to information right and and when look when the system is self-organizing its function and its development are also now inseparable because it functions by developing and it develops by functioning so you get development and function are now wedded together and they were separated before and hardware and software are now wedded together and they were separated before and how do emotions fit into this emotions are really important some of your viewers might know that one of you know one of the most important thinkers in the last 25 years about emotion Ronnie D'Souza is also at the University of Toronto and you know Ronnie's work was really important for making us understand the rat I mean his book his seminal book is the rationality of emotions so you know really attacking that sort of decadent romantic idea we have of this nth if assists and antagonism between reason and emotion and you have to choose one rather than the other which is a very strange thing we think of that as natural and that's such a mistake because if you go before like the Romantic period even go back for example into Plato in the whole neo platonic tradition love and reason are deeply into defined and intermeshing I mean philosophy ax means the love of wisdom right a philosophy so what Ronnie helped to do was show how important emotions are to our rational agency and then there's been a lot of work like people like DiMaggio in his book des cartes error Montague reads book and your brain is almost perfect talking about the fundamental difference between us and computers as we care and we have to about the information we're processing it's precisely because you care that you could do right this this selecting what's obvious so like you know DiMaggio studied people and Descartes Sarah where there they have a kind of brain damage so the computational part of the brain is working great they can do great you know puzzle solving and calculation and the inferential stuff on an IQ test but if you sort of did this with him if you said here's a red ink pen and here's a blue ink pen which one do you want to write the test with they'll go ah because they try to calculate all the possible permutations right because the capacity to care and right and to be moved that's what emotions do for you anger is just a powerful way in which your Bioeconomy creates a salience landscape so that action and identities are obvious to you does it work perfectly no nothing can we have to give up that cartesian idea that there's something like a cognitively perfect form of cognition but do our emotions absolutely central to your cognitive agency definitely we should go we should we we have to see reason and emotion as deeply interdependent and intered affine and the the idea of the embodied brain how widespread is that how is this sort of is what you're doing in cognitive science sort of cutting edge or is this sort of becoming the accept of wisdom somewhere between those two I think the ideas of embodied cognition third generation Clark's I are I wouldn't say it's consensus in cognitive science but definitely mainstream although some of the best cutting-edge theoretical work is still being done there what's heartening to me for example is that these ideas that are becoming more prevalent to machine learning in one Emily in one sense and that are definitely becoming more prevalent in cognitive science and the philosophy of mind are now permeating into psychology and what is the kind of real-world impact of this cognitive science it does it suggests that we that we should all be doing certain embodied if we want to kind of improve our cognition what what does it kind of what's the real world relevance of it well there's there's two in very different directions I mean one myself in Evin for example and other people Francisco Varela there is this growing confluence between third generation cog saw and traditional sets of psycho technologies for altering consciousness and cognition like Buddhism and Taoist practices I even have a course at the University of Toronto called Buddhism and cog side where I try and talk about and explore that that confluence it was actually the progenitor to the video series in important ways and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to teach that course and so I think that's definitely the case but the other thing I think there's other I think it's giving us a way and this is also part of the real world impact I think it's giving and this really matters it's giving people a new vocabulary for talking about existential and spiritual meaning and transformation that I think is really really important people need to be able to articulate their experience to remove you know confusion equivocation to properly align cognitive processes for causal efficacy all of this is afforded by this enriched and I think empowering vocabulary and then the third thing is one that is going it has been and is going to increasingly make an impact on the meaning crisis which is the advent of you know autonomous artificial general intelligence which is coming that that is definitely coming and that's gonna make an impact on our existential self understanding greater I will predict than the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution in something we've noticed in the people that we've interviewed so far the the people that I found that have been the most interesting bringing forth the most kind of fascinating perspectives often have a kind of either familiarity with or a yeah relationship with what I might call the liminal space there's some sense that they're able to tap into a sort of a space beyond themselves does that make any sense at all for a scientist I think I do understand what you're saying as a cognitive scientist and also as John brave a key because one of the things that I'm doing not myself alone other people like I would point your your viewers to the really important work of La Paul she literally wrote the book on transformative experience called transformative experience I mean and this is really you know this is really tough rigorous but nevertheless beautifully written philosophy right cognitive science and I I've had the pleasure to talk to Laurie at each guest lecture in one of her classes and so more and more people and this is what we do in the consciousness and wisdom study lab my lab at the University we're studying these transformative experiences where people are having things like mystical experiences awakening experiences and they have a sense of a deeper connectedness to a deeper level of reality and I don't think that's a mistake I'm sort of placing my cognitive scientific bet on the fact that and I make arguments to this effect and I talk about this and it's one publishing work on that these higher states of consciousness really are important and constitutive of you know optimizing our cognition again not in terms of what see the problem that we've had is that we've concentrated on the what that these prop these states give us and I think that has been a fundamental mistake I think it's inevitable that it happens because people have to talk about it share it with others and then that it gets it meshed right and that's fine but I think the how of these states the way they optimize our relevance realization transform it and enable something sort of analogous to the way what you see in child development where children are sort of locked in schematic ways of thinking and they make all of these systematic errors and then they have you know appear as yet en you know change and they go from one stage to another and although that system of illusions that they were prey to has in a way and I think you see the same kind of attempt to become sensitive to and be able to intervene in systemic sets of illusion that beset sort of normal adult cognition and consciousness and people through these transformative experiences get better in the how they optimize better how to get a grip on reality to connect to reality and to get this sort of reciprocal realization they are being opened up and reality are being opened up in a coupled reciprocal manner and I think that is all something that cognitive science is and will increasingly say more and more about so are you saying that these kind of awakening experiences are part of our development I don't want to sound like I don't want to make it sound like an inevitable thing right I think what they are is they they are a genuine option for us for a form of self transcendence that we can render scientifically legitimate by understanding the way it optimizes the how of our cognitive meaning making and the evolution of that meaning making what so I I need a little bit more specific I mean I can talk about how sort of we evolved as a species that I can talk about the cultural of evolution like things like the actual revolution and I understand that and I do think part of what the series has tried to do is point out the deep connection between the invention of psycho technologies and their internalization and then that how that transforms the how of cognition let me give you a a a I think a non-controversial example so one of the things I would argue that drove and many people would agree with this is not just my claim that drove the the axial revolution of around 800 BC to 300 BC this is when the great world religions were being invented philosophy is being invented Buddhism's being that all this is being invented right Karl Jasper's originally put his finger on this Karen Armstrong has wrote a really good book on this called the great transformation anyways one of the things that's going on especially in the eastern Mediterranean is the invention of alphabetic literacy right so before that you have like ideograph like I have like ideograms a tattooed on my arm right but you have India graphic higher grip you have all these very complex and and so being literate is a very demanding thing in fact your job in the ancient world is you can be ascribed which means your only job is and it's a good job is you're literate alright and so a small percentage of the population is literate when you get alphabetic literacy the the really amount some people I think have estimated it it's well surround 20% of the population becomes literate right now think about what that psycho technology does to you does for you okay you have deeply internalized it it is so automatic to you right if I put a word up in front of you and say look at this and don't read it you won't be able to do it right it's absolutely transparent it's so internalized to your cognition you probably think in sentences in your head but think about what literacy does to your cognition okay it I can now store my thoughts external to me and I can come back later and revise them so I could connect previous instances of my brain to current instances that massively increases right the processing power I can I can link my processing to your processing I can step back and look at it at length rather than trying to hold it in working memory all of this means I can massively self-correct my own cognition so try and do this thought experiment with me think about all the problems you're solving day to day basis all the information you're processing now I take literacy from you most of those problems are now insoluble by you you can't you can't do it you can't process the information you can't access the information you can't hold the information you can't distribute the information that's what psycho technologies do and what happens is they get invented for practical purposes but then they get internalized they permeate the functionality of our cognition and then they transform us so people because are things like alphabetic literacy because of the increased power and the increased awareness of their own cognition they got a much greater sense of how this meaning making in their mind distorts reality and that's what helps afford the whole axle revolution so our cognition is there's a cognitive cultural evolution to our cognition so that things we take to be natural are actually internalized via psycho technologies from our culture and and and of course the internet and other things that our smartphones are also doing that we are naturally born cyborgs are our brains evolved to internalize these psycho technologies and physical technologies and the thing about the internet is it that's doing it in a huge ways we don't yet understand great place to to end John for everyone watching really highly recommend John series awakening from the meaning crisis and I think you're gonna do 50 episodes all together yep that's right I'm not going to ask you how it ends now because I don't want to give it away for anyone okay yeah we've already filmed 28 and so the filming is ongoing but we're definitely committed to 50 great real pleasure speaking to John this was a great pleasure for me thank you very much you're a great at Milwaukee [Music] you [Music]
