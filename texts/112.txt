I started to make sense of a lot of what I've been doing over the last few years I've done quite a lot of sort of deep transformational practices a lot of shadow work so integrating the shadow and actually feeling that real sense of becoming more in alignment with myself but it was through listening to you that I made this connection with the logos with the idea that this is actually a deep principle of Western culture which gave it another it's it's the principle of the Incarnation right because the Incarnation is is as at least a symbolic representation of the idea that the Spirit has to fully inhabit the body right and that's also a remarkable it's a remarkable idea especially because the spirit so to speak the psyche if you want flees from the body and terror because the body is the place of mortality and suffering and so people are disembodied and it's because what one way of looking at is because they're too afraid to become fully embodied and it's no wonder they're afraid there's reason to be afraid but the question is well what would you be like if you had the courage to be fully embodied and that's fully incarnate that's another way of thinking about that and the idea that Christian idea is that the fully incarnate human being is the Messiah that's the idea that's a hell of an idea you know but it means embracing the horrors of the world that's what it means and that's not only the horrors of the world but the evil of the world you know so there's this idea that Christ absolutely well then those are those are not different and you know there's this idea that not only was Christ the Incarnate spirit right so fully descended into the body let's say but that he also took the sins of the world onto himself and what that means is that psychologically speaking is that part of spiritual development is to recognize the satanic tendencies that characterize you and to fully wrestle with them and to and to integrate them that's the thing it's it's not so much to cast them away it's to transmute them you know and you can see the difference between people who've done that and people who haven't at least to some degree because people who haven't integrated the shadow at all are naive and you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them and because they're naive they're often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of it and someone who's integrated that more they're dangerous in in the martial arts sort of way which is they're dangerous but they don't have to be they don't have to use it
