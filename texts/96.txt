every man should do this you know like there's not enough good positive role models and information for men there educates men on how to be better men and we all need as a species just makes you see how everyday you go and make yourself small and you compromise and you don't step fully into your potential and that there was something I really felt in that room I'm getting a glimpse of hey what if you just dared there is a real act of courage require to fully show up and tell the truth to other men and you know for me doesn't come naturally necessarily to give that level of trust but the more the space builds and the more the trust builds within the group the easier that becomes and then the feeling is one not just of release but one of dignity and strength and being kind of fully in my power I think all men could use a good shot of that energy and I think all women would be really happy if all men did I'm feeling empowered I'm feeling strongly I feel like brothers it's not just about this weekend it's about creating something defining what what is being a man now very few of us got this from our fathers so being able to give this to each other in a space like this is really valuable what I found particularly helpful was arriving here and it being mostly strangers and by the end of the weekend we're able to offer each other insights that are deeply powerful and very insightful that not just make me feel good at the moment but I can take away and harness in my everyday life it was incredibly constructive it you know things I am a father I intend to pass lots of these teachings to my son I think there's lots of the stuff to have done today that will make me a better man I believe that in spaces like this we really get to feel those masculine energies the fires the vulnerability whatever but in in a space of understanding that no actually this is a beautiful gift you know it's something something to be trusted in something the world really really needs you never knew that you were missing this but you are you you don't know that this is what you've actually wanted your entire life but it is [Music] [Music] [Music]
