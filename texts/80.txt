[Music] Jeff you recently did a podcast for the daily Evolver about Jordan Peterson and I was really struck by of all of the critiques that I've seen and I've done a couple of documentaries about Peterson now so I've been sort of studying the phenomenon fairly fairly closely and a lot of the critiques that I've seen have come from quite a they seem a little bit unfair or a little bit shrill or a bit reactive and I wondered a couple of things and your critique actually seemed very very generous it seemed to be coming from a place of yes and with Peterson rather than a kind of objection or or a feeling of reactivity towards Peterson I wonder I've got a couple of questions what one is why do you think he creates that kind of reactivity and why did your critique not have that reactivity well I think he creates that kind of reactivity because most people are mano perspectival and you know just to put a little bit of integral theory on the table there's basically three worldviews that are online in the developed world right now that are in contention the traditionalist worldview which is you know more ethnocentric religious conservative so forth the modernist worldview which is secular and sort of the business people the academic whatever and the postmodern which is more civil rights and you know rehabilitating the people who have been left behind and sensitivity and all of that sort of thing so these are every one of them thinks that they're right and every one of them is at this stage of that game because we have just in terms of the development of cultures and I'm talking in the developed world we've polarized so we really know which side of the street we're on you know so you have a guy like Jordan Peterson come along and he's actually has a facility at all of these stages and you know nobody knows where to put him and so if he has a conservative of you or if he comes where he's from where he's defending religion or traditional sex roles or things like you know self-discipline and humility and then people think he's in that box of the you know crazy religious conservative and you know the were you know were were often running so that so to appreciate Jordan Peterson you also have to be somewhat mano perspectival and when I talked about there being three stages online traditional modern and postmodern we would also posit this is the integral thing that there's a next stage online called integral which is an integration of the best of what all of the three previous stages have to offer okay so it has the capacity to hold all three of those stages and Jordan Peterson has that capacity and that's why he's hit such a nerve and and and and has been so thrilling and also in terms of where he well maybe I'll stop there and and see would you would you cite from the old perspective he is an integral thinker yes I would he is able to definitely think integrally he has integral cognition as we would say his his heart in a way is in traditionalism in my opinion in a way that I think keeps him a little stuck there honestly but I don't care because what he's doing is he is helping this whole strata of people who have never had traditionalism well installed okay maybe they had postmodern parents maybe they had read pre-modern parents maybe they don't have any parents but they didn't get the the strata of tradition which is where you're taught to sit down and shut up where you have to be obedient where you think that they're theirs you see the sort of higher natural hierarchies at least where you're taught to be proud of your country to have humility all of that stuff and I guess the deepest story of that is that your culture has value that their solution airy story that has been played out through through your culture that you don't fully understand you should have some kind of respect for that absolutely absolutely yes and that's the part that's ethnocentric but and and really difficult to for people who are at the postmodern stage to have any appreciation for that they just see it as racist but so that's the integral move is to see what is it about Britishness what is it about persian as' chineseness Americanist what is it that's so precious you could just feel it ringing through the land you know that's that's important we want to bring that online and and you've got to get through green to do that you got to get through post modernity to do that that ain't easy just some some an interesting tension that kind of you talked about on your podcasts is that you know Peterson has been asked a few times and I think Jonathan rouse and also kind of asked him around is okay so what elements of post-modernism do we take forward and his response was was sort of kind of none this is pretty much ideological possession I find that a very interesting point because I think from a lot of my kind of progressive or green friends they that's the main sticking point with them I think it's that no but they're and I would agree to you know to a degree where it's like yeah there are some very valuable things to take through so what are your thoughts on his kind of stance on that of like no you you throw it you throw that baby out with the bathwater yeah I think that's the part that is the the real sticking part of him really moving into a integral embrace you know a real you know where where his hearts more at the integral stage instead of just his head yeah he sees I think you know maybe he has been as a lot of us have been who have been in graduate school recently you know sort of traumatized by the whole thing especially if you're a white guy you know that there is a there's absolutely a new kind of hierarchy where the victim is on top and you know that and that's just as oppressive there's a lot of what we would say in the red or pre-modern sort of warrior the fighting stance that is that green is infected with you know and all of that's true and and I'm glad that Jordan Peterson is fighting that battle but when he talks about you know sensitivity who he refuses to talk to anybody who would talk about white privilege you know that's that's sort of ideological if you ask me and in in in and so he sees that whole sort of move towards sensitivity that and femininity I also think that he there's a lot of unnecessary sort of sorting out of masculine and feminine qualities to men and women you know in a way that feels that the perfect world for Jordan Peterson would be some sort of a better more improved stage right at the traditional and modern stage of development you know a really good version of that would be his perfect world and that's you know I think that actually you know gender fluidity and a lot of these things are actually harbingers of what's to come you know and in the people go overboard with it yeah join the club this is humanity we always do but we're also staking out new territory that will allow ultimately the full range of human capacities from the masculine pole to the feminine pole and there they're those masculine and feminine poles are there and they're juicy and we want to we don't want to blend them we don't want homogenized them which is what post modernity tries to do so we see that they're separate but we also say that they're they're available to everybody regardless of biological sex now people we're going to sort out the way they sort out and people are going to have what preferences they have but the the whole landscape is available when we talk about post-modernism there's there's a lot of terms that seem that they could get kind of conflated here because Peterson certainly has a real dislike of certain aspects of post modernity and Wilber also talks about this idea of the eighth a perspective or madness that hidden within post-modernism is a is a worldview that doesn't really make any sense I guess Peterson would call it it's not a playable game to the idea that everything is equally valid and nothing is true is not something that you can actually live out in your life so it's and I wonder when when some integral thinkers in particular sort of say well Peterson is is very anti green they seem like his real vitriol seems to be aimed at least from my perspective towards that that a perspective or madness the idea that there are no truths rather than the things that have come out of Greenwich you might talk of civil rights and yeah that the the kind of the green civil rights wave right yeah the positive the unqualified positive of green of post modernity no it's true and I think he does really focus on that you know a perspectival madness the idea that there is no truth and he points out that where that leads and this is again another sort of developmental thing mistake or that I would add this to the mix is that in 2018 world this is not going to lead to the gulag okay so you know he gets all worked up about where this sort of a perspectival thing can lead and points out the you know the history of the 20th century well part of the history of the 20th century is that we have at least in the developed world about the whole world actually but in the developed world we've moved to a center of gravity of modernity where you know it's just we're pacified you know that that's not a real threat anymore and I just would you know point that out and you know and I think that's another small critique that I would happen but it's it's part of what makes you know I think one of the moves of integral is that we can fight the same battles that we fought all along but we do it without demonizing our opponents and we do it without hating them and we do it with a certain love in lightness to our heart that I don't quite recognize in Jordan Peterson yeah I think this is this is a really good point because when he talks about that there is this this worldview that has so many people he talks about the kind of the value of ideas and the post modernity is a pernicious ideology and it has people in their grip you would imagine that the the logical next step would be to have some empathy for these people yes like if people have been given ideas that are not their own and they're following ideas that are not their own surely that the thing to do is to hold our hands out and say have some empathy for the fact that they've been misled rather than this this this really strong attack on them which I get a lot of time from Peterson yeah I think that's that's valid and well said and and also to appreciate the the actual positive of nature of that radical deconstruction you know part of what that's all about is deconstructing these grand narratives of history whether it's the you know everything's going to be great once everybody accepts Jesus as their personal Savior okay so that's the grant narrative traditionalists of modernists everything's going to be great once everybody becomes rational okay that proves to be wrong you know so post modernity comes in and says okay all of your grand narratives you know all of your tribe will all of your religion all of your ideas of truth and there is something that is just necessary about that cleansing even though it leaves you nuts and depressed and useless there is that hiss of stage on the path that you want to get through as quickly as possible and a lot of people are stuck there but there is something beyond that and so that brings on a respect for that in a way that I don't get from Peterson it's an interesting thing because Francois Lyotard one of the kind of fathers of post-modernism said at one point that all this deconstruction if it's not tempered by the sublime this point where there is absolute meaning which is almost like your North Star if you have that point the deconstruction could be incredibly productive it's enough for me from my background it's a psychedelic kind of experience you know everything that wall certain becomes relational etc but he made a point of that very early on in this intellectual endeavor to say without the sublime the postmodern will lead to madness and I thought what's interesting for me watching Peterson is a big part of what he's reviving is the sublime in some sense through the unconscious Christianity yes indeed he is and and I love he's a beautiful transmitter of the sublime beautiful transmitter I mean I've seen things that have given me chills when he talks about whether or not you make your bed has cosmic consequences I agree actually and and to actually get that's cosmos centric you know we talked about moving from ethnocentric to world centric you know to cosmos centric in an integral week where we start you know getting in touch with the actual animating energetics of the cosmos you know and there's a new rien chant minh the world that comes online at that point because we actually do realize that there's a new creation story that is you know delivered to us by science it's not we don't have to bypass science science shows us that something came out of nothing 13.8 billion years ago and as complexified into us now there's a spiritual path in there somewhere and we don't have to get you know all stuck I mean we could see the our religious traditions our you know pre-modern or Christianity all of them as beautiful you know art forms spiritual art forms full of beautiful practices for this realization that we are evolving creatures in an evolving cosmos and we've come from somewhere we're going from somewhere and the you know for me the only way any of it makes sense is if there is some continuity between lifetimes you know you don't have to believe that but I'm not sure I believe that but you know I you could play with that because we could actually see it it's science shows it to us my just sort of going back a little bit to the idea of post modernity is sort of this cleansing and then we reconstruct afterwards I I hear a lot of people talking talking like that in terms of the that's the process we're going through but I guess what I really got an appreciation of listening to Peterson is there are some things we cannot erase that there is a biological lived reality there are certain archetypal structures that are just pre-existing because of the way that that we exist as biological creatures the that actually post modernity cannot erase and that this is something that I'm sort of struggling with a little bit because yeah there's that there's a this what post modernity does it erase it thinks it does yeah that's that's that's a distinction I would make you know an integral rewear I realize what you're saying is true is that wait a wait a minute no there are things that are actually true that you know the you know boiling point of water that the the the you know whatever is there is there are actual true things and so that we sort of you know correct for the excesses of you know extreme deconstruction yeah and that I think Peterson's phrase was that our experience of the world is parameterised by a biological heritage and by our embodied nature and that's something as well I mean I mentioned it before the idea of a playable game is a really clever idea it's like yeah you can say you can you can play the postmodern game as much as you want but and say that all all possibilities are equally valid okay go and try and live that out in your life and see what happens exactly you know that's why you know that that philosophy or that worldview exists in academia because you actually don't have to go out and do anything but but you know talk about it in the real world people are disabused of that pretty quickly you know I mean yeah III get the problem and you know I think that Peterson is doing God's work and in you know confronting that as beautifully as he is yeah and for me I mean I've done quite a lot of kind of inner work and been part of I guess spiritual communities for quite a long time and what I really got from Peterson was a real sense of the kind of reinvention of the Christian tradition and to post Christianity that integrates this incredible intellectual and spiritual tradition in a way that makes intelligible to me and so I'm sure to many other people I mean I was raised a Christian and then I started reading ein Rand and then I went into atheism you know then I moved to Boulder and you know I became all postmodern but but part of my continued growth is turning and reom bracing the the spiritual truths of Christianity you know that are given to us through Christianity and no other place you know that I'd say the same for Buddhism that's the other religion I've deeply practiced and I can't imagine my life without both God and emptiness but you you know you can't get a Christian or a Buddhist that you know go to the other Pole but I love both of those poles I love both of those things and I feel seen and loved by God in a way that I never imagined in my early 20s that I would you know and I'm so glad that Jordan Peterson is you know reach an ting this you know disenchanted world of modernity for people honor God I mean yeah we are we're you know no free will and you know just accidents what matter I mean I don't know it's it's it's very depressing very distant heart disheartening for people and so he's again literally doing God's work yeah I think by my friend Andrew Sweeney said he's one of the few people in the world that seems to be on fire with the holy spirit which is a yeah it's it's so true there is something very yeah yeah I've said it before he has a very performative aspect to what he's doing but when you look at his philosophy seems very aligned with it he talks about the logos and the idea that you incarnate the logos more in your own lie and by doing so you become more embodied you become more present and and he is a living example of that which is something I'd never put those two things together before quite so clearly and as when I was listening to him ah yeah beautiful yeah it's a it's actually it's interesting if you look at postmodern art compared to art that really follows the kind of Union monomyth so if you look at like Waiting for Godot where there's just two guys waiting for you know you know metaphor for God and nothing happens you know that was my was through I studied English literature it was through stuff that was really crappy to read you know and what Peterson is doing is kind of moving away from that as a I think a cultural reference point to know it's Lord of the Rings and you're Frodo you know it's it's that kind of mythic journey and I think to a degree that's perhaps why it appeals to men and young men in particular who feel directionless that'd be an interesting thing to get your perspective on of this disappear to the masculine that Peterson house oh yes no it's beautiful and and it's a palliative to a world particularly in academia in certain aspects of the culture that have become you know feminized in a way that's you know pernicious too much and so you know this whole group of young men feel yeah there's no meaning there's this there's no religion that you know you know a toxic masculinity you know I have all this privilege it sure as hell doesn't feel like it but I guess I do no no no we're here you know we're here this precious human life I mean good god we're the creations of Almighty God somehow here we are and we're here for a reason and one of the things that you know we want to bring forward into integral into an integral sensibility is what we left behind when we moved into modernity which is world that is dripping with meaning you know where everything matters you know who you meet who you talk to whether or not you made your bed what thoughts you're thinking you know that's all part of this heroic journey and every person you meet is the little Frodo or a little somebody who has something for you you know you can sort of have that as a practice to say what does that person have for me why do I have for them you know as I move through this amazing journey that you know it's tragic it's kamek it's you know all of humanity what the are we doing here I mean this is really yeah this is absolutely fascinating this was something that came to me on the plane on the way over to interview Peterson was I made a few documentaries about Isis and I've always felt what a seductive worldview that is to go from being I don't know someone kind of working in a shop somewhere to on the front lines of the struggle for your civilization and then it struck me that what Peterson is doing through the the wider mythological work and framing it within this kind of theological framework is making your life as meaningful as that that every single thing you do is taking the world either closer to or further away from hell and it's it's essential it seems to me absolutely essential if we're going to kind of struggle against those kind of very seductive worldviews but we need something like this yes yes no it's so true and and you know God might have caused my centric as well yes absolutely yeah and we could see it in play you know I mean something came out of nothing and it's us you know good lord but yeah it's you know the the we we want to you know we talked about the three big stages that are online there's actually three stages that we identify that are previous to that and those are the worlds of like tribal magic and in great myths and we went those back on - you know we want to see that the world you know that nature is enchanted and I love that about Jordan Peterson he has this sort of Native American practice that he does with this sort of community that I think is really helps round out the guy you had on the end of your documentary David did the guide Road in Greenville yes my goodness gracious what a integral transmission about you know taking it back down to zero and nature and communication and contact with other human beings and yes yes yes yes that is that that's where we're going and that's where modernity gets stuck because modernity you know has to get rid of all of the superstition and all of the magic all of the myth that's its job it reduces everything to the exterior z-- - what's measurable it has notes you know use for meaning or any of that kind of stuff and so for a lot of people they think that the only way to greet to reach aunt my life or to enchant my life is to go back to some sort of a mythic religion and and then a lot of people can't do that you know you just can't uncook that egg you know what I mean and so a lot of people who are have a modern sensibility can't go back to a mythic meaning-making system and what they need to know is that we can go forward to a meaning making systems that Rhian chance the world in a way that science not only doesn't have a problem with it delivers it to us it's so fascinated and I have been talking recently about Terence Mckenna who is one of my favorite thinkers and you know he he had a book called the archaic revival and that really you know it's it's that idea really it's that kind of reinterment and is taking the archaic but not going back but saying yes and I think you're braiding it into it's it's so essential yeah yeah right on yeah and you know I think Jordan Peterson is doing his part you know in a way that looks like a Sam Harris another hero of mine in a way you know steven pinker another hero of mine Jonathan Hite another you know there's some great public intellectuals I have critiques of all of them in a certain way but one of the things that Jordan Peterson is bringing to the party is you know a certain kind of magic you know immediate meaning yeah he he is telling but for me at least my my feeling of even when I first encountered his thought is that he is telling that the deep story of Western culture better than anyone I've ever seen yes and doing it from a very deeply embodied place and this is I mean I found I guess I found out about him last July last June or July and then immediately kind of went over and interviewed him fairly soon afterwards and I was convinced I knew as soon as I found him this was the right voice for the times that he was and nothing that's happened since in terms of his kind of rocketing to fame has surprised me in any any way whatsoever it was so clear that this was an essential voice for right now and and is kind of you could look at it slightly scary as well it's like we've lost sight of things to this point that we are so thirsty for it that we need this kind of transmission right now and I think it's a sign of how far we've strayed from these eternal truths that that he has become so famous in such a short amount of time yeah I mean the only thing I would say is I agree with all of that I would just say that the strain also was fruitful and that you know you know there's there's there's something about that you know what are the markers of the postmodern view particularly is people are depressed you know we're living in this ever darkening world and you know that that one of the things I loved about Jordan Peterson is he you know there's a million of these little youtubes and stuff but I don't pretend to have seen them all but he did this one on the beauty of high functioning depression that I thought was just fantastic you know and and and it you know sort of if it gives meaning to that and so you know the the world the Lord works in mysterious ways and we we you know it's a messy progress process this I I often say evolution is beautiful but not pretty and you know you can look at human history and you can see that yeah so you know I I totally resonate with that and you know if I look at my own personal journey as an individual you know you go through a long dark night of the soul very often in a spiritual journey and during it I you know you've you're in that eight perspectival madness it's horrible after it for me I'm you know my feeling is I would never change that it made me who I am so what elements of this journey we've been on through post modernity do you think we need to take into integral and what do we need to leave behind well we need to take it the integral of the sensitivity of post modernity and of green you know that sort of sensitivity to all the people who've been left out of the previous stages so we could say that you know traditionalism tends to divide the world between saints and sinners post modernity says we went to sinners you know modernity says winners and losers post modernity says what we went the losers to it so you know that we want to have a you know equality you know it it's it's over you know they overdo it and it's you know very Christian to me yes it is yes this is my theory about this isn't really interesting it's like from a lot of kind of people talking about the benefits of green it's like there's a sort of idea that there was this this wave of egalitarianism that came in in the 60s and then we we had civil rights we had gay rights we had women's liberation I I suspect and I don't know but I suspect Peterson might say no that's not a new thing that's come in that's actually the natural consequence of the Christian idea of the innate value and divinity of every individual playing itself out on a wider level and so you could actually trace that down a lot further than a new force that comes into play in the 60s what do you got Eric fair enough I mean I think that's I think that's a really legitimate point for sure I mean Jesus Jesus was Green you know but we could also see the stages of a Christian of the church you know and that the what what we get a full blossoming of in post modernity is that all of these all of the human dignities are bestowed on everybody not just my religion not just my country not just my people my race but everybody and particularly the people who have been left behind but you're right it is the full fruition of the teachings of Jesus Christ absolutely right but but for the first time yeah it's it's yeah it's actually it also shows up the hypocrisy of the previous manifestation of some of these you know how humans do it I mean we it's it's amazing that you know people like the great saints and sages like Christ and Buddha the people who've really magnetized people are actually teach to have their teachings are from you know post integral stages of development and there's something about their teachings and their transmission that is riveting to the rest of us but we translate it into our own stage of development and we use it to gouge each other's eyes out for you know few other few thousand years until we finally really get it but it is interesting how that works yeah I think for me one of those most interesting things of what we've already covered is this reintroduction of the transcendent I think that's such a galvanizing pour I think it's why Star Wars is popular because got the force without the force Star Wars would be just I don't think it would doing well you know and I've often thought about Peterson and that's the revival that needs to happen but ya know I mean the force is definitely with him for the moment yeah and you know may he you know one of the things I would just say in a favor of Jordan Peterson as you know cutting edge you know even you know I have my critiques about it whatever but he has a flexibility of mind and a resistance to being put in boxes and a sense of I'm learning too you know and a sense of provisional you know that there's a humility yes yes thank you that I think is remarkable considering all his gifts and so you know I'm a fan yeah I guess that would be my only question is you've been quite sort of clear on where you you see him falling short or not his blind spots but you still started off this conversation by saying that you thought he was an integral thinker yeah I mean in you know this is part of the developmental schema but you know we could we develop in certain lines of development and and one of we talked about is sort of the leading line is cognition that is are we actually able to see different systems of thought so there's one thing to see them and then there's another thing to sort of install them in your sort of heart and then there's another thing to really get down into your belly you know so I would say that you know I'm integral from the waist up on a good day you know I'd say George org Peterson is integral from the neck up but a good day I don't know who knows but that's what I'm talking about yeah I also think that he seems to have integrated or at least to be able to access read in a way that very few people in this culture are and I think that's part of what gives him the performative aspect like he he has anger and the shadow at his at his call in a way that for sure quite intimidating as well for a lot of people ya know I think you're right and that and that also is a marker of integral is somebody who can access read without being you know just completely driven or contained by read but when we talk about read we're talking about just sure sheer power you know the use of power and so being willing to get into the arena being willing to have conflict being willing to cut somebody's head off being willing to have your own head cut off you know that kind of stuff that's warrior today is a good day to die the marker of that redness and we want to have that you know and he does you're right and that's one of the reasons that he his followers are so passionate is that they they want and this is evolutionarily potent we what you know we fight our way forward we also the other F word our way forward but fight our way forward to and and so you know that he is a warrior it's one of the things I talked about I am most admire him in my podcast was that he's a fighter and yeah that's that's you know that's great I think that's a that's a cool quality action because you know to some degree the Trump and brexit phenomena are a reaction against the hypocrisy of green for not integrating their red it's this kind of like you are not as inclusive as you think you are you've got that anger in you like we're gonna go to you and troll you until you show it like that's a really interesting thing happening yeah I do too that's well said yeah I guess that was a big part of the the glitch in the matrix documentary for me was this shadow of liberalism this idea that liberalism is there's a hypocrisy and liberalism because there is a tribalism we are naturally tribal creatures and until we accept and understand that you know we're completely open we're completely accepting we are so tolerant except for those people who don't think like we do [Laughter] that's it yeah no it's true we are the kind of creatures that don't make sense so I'm glad you like the glitch film as well yeah that's that's what I was going to say actually is that in terms of actual integral transmission I thought the glitch in the matrix that you did is as integral as anything I've seen the people that you interviewed the way you presented it it was I was thrilled to see it and I'm really interested in seeing you know more of your stuff it's interesting that you say that the glitch was an integral transmission because at one point I want we did actually record some integral stuff that I was toying with putting in and then he in the end didn't but it was a real influence on the construction of it and and was yeah a big sort of invisible superstructure on what I was putting together so it's interesting that you spotted it yeah well if we're right integral is not just you know a theory it's the next stage of human history unfolding and so people are going to be thinking integrally whether they have ever read a kid Wilbur book or not and and we're seeing more and more of that and I boy definitely saw it in your your documentary yeah well really great meeting you David and Allie great meeting you as well yeah yes Godspeed guys
