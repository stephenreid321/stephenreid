[Music] last month rebel wisdom put out a series of films with the integral philosopher Ken Wilber Jamie Wheel is recognized as one of the world's leading experts on peak performance and transformation as the head of the flow Genome Project and author of the Pulitzer prize-nominated stealing fire he has a long history with integral theory going back two decades and worked for one of the only two integral management consulting firms attempting to bring the principles to business leaders he reflects on the legacy of integral it seems to be the case as we move into these you know nominally transpersonal communities is that all of these thought leaders who have been breaking trail right they've but they brought they brought through something profound something unique something useful they bringing a tool to our shared collective and by default and or by design we're all wounded healers we all need the thing that we've built more than anybody else needs it and I think that that same case is probably true for Ken and rather than having the people who have experienced and benefited from integral theory then rise up in some sort of unreconciled slay the father angry child dynamic can there be instead the sense of hey wow your life's work has lit things up in me has helped guide my path right has brought me to places I never had imagined and perhaps can we then turn around and give back the wounded healer the realized gift that they offered in the first place and not needs to not no need to knock them down off pedestals and no need to kind of reclaim our gold and kind of Angry and dysfunctional ways but to say thank you so much and let us return the favor let us return academic acknowledgement let us return community let us rich love appreciation affection and challenge let us show up as the humans you've been writing about all along and let's help you take that final step for yourself we don't all need all of our teachers to be Moses leading people to the promised land and getting stuck on the edge we can actually welcome the folks that help guide us to that land - to the potty itself so Jamie great to speak to you again from Texas shown we recently put out a film with Ken Wilber looking at Jordan Pederson and the intellectual dark web and what I think is a really important piece like I've been certainly very influenced by integral and think that the developmental framework has a lot to add to this emergent conversation that Jordan Pederson has helped to kind of spark the intellectual dark where as part of it and I'm I know that you've got a background with the integral community and you're also one of the most inspiring thinkers that we've met in the time that we've been doing this I was really impressed with the pieces that we put out with you I think you're holding a really key piece so I want and I I'm fascinated you have a history with integral as well I wonder if you might want to sort of go through that for us sure I mean I think I was I was actually teaching at a boarding school in California right after grad school so I was in my early 20s and the headmaster gave me Ken's brief history of everything and said you might want to read this and I and I jumped into it and found that his descriptions of upper stages of development and in particularly I think he talked about the aftershocks of ego death experiences and the little ghosts that come back afterwards and I remember it was such a lifesaver for me at the time and then dived in that book and I think it was probably the densest thing I'd ever read for fun you know not actually assigned and that really opened my open my eyes and open my world to everything from a validation of interior experiences to the notion of adult development and vertical development and the sort of sense that we don't just stop at puberty or stop you know in our 20s and and found it immensely valuable as an initial kind of orienting framework and then even sort of virusscan on thinking and making sense of things and then you went a bit more deeply into it as well I think we did we were you know educators by you know I was sort of historian anthropologist by academic training and then was working deeply in basically developmentally informed education ranging from Montessori to Knowles which is sort of like an outward-bound kind of version of you know how do you take people into expeditionary environments and and learn and train and then play a role with the integral education community standing that up which was a kind of a subset or branch of Ken's integral Institute in the kind of early 2000s and then as a result of that work was actually recruited by one of only two sort of truly integral management consulting firms and then went into the corporate space along with John Mackey who was the founder of Whole Foods that started the conscious capitalism movement and we worked within the young presidents organization which is a global organization of business leaders that's very it's quite powerful they control about nine trillion dollars in global market cap and we conducted a series of experiments over the better part of a decade on how do you bring integrally informed development leadership organization and communication into high-growth businesses and help the capitalists become a little more conscious so it's been a wild ride and a fun experiment yeah because I I guess the the interesting thing about both Jordan Peterson and the intellectual diet over in this kind of networked conversation is that it's it's kind of open to fit it's in the new digital age so it's got to be open to feedback it's got to be open to evolution and that's I guess what I'm really interested in in being part of that cuz I think integral has a really interesting and valuable point to bring but there are also I'm sure lessons that can be learned of integral successes and integrals failures because there was a huge high point of it probably in the 90s and 2000's and the question is whether it had the impact that it that it should have had all could have had and also what we can learn from it if we're involved in some of the same questions now and I I guess you've you've had a lot of experience right at the sharp end of that conversation yeah absolutely and and it does feel there's a couple of things it feels like the thought leaders today and whether that's in the crypto space and thinking about kind of decentralized organizations or whether it's an existential risk or even kind of in more sophisticated versions of personal development and leadership development I have noticed that even without teasing it out or calling it out it kind of bubbles up in conversations that a significant number of those folks took on and can seriously considered integral frameworks at some point earlier in their life so I think that's just kind of interesting to note equally interesting to note no one is branding their work their movement or ideas in that way these days and so that's just kind of a you know a curiosity but I think also a four hat tip to the the ongoing significance of that sort of integral Institute diaspora you know I think it was sort of a Schumpeter's creative destruction writ large where an awful lot of fascinating people were drawn together around that movement when it imploded exploded depending on your point of view its scattered and dispersed a lot of those people but the relationships and the shared ideas have persisted and borne a lot of fruit yeah you said what I thought was a really beautiful metaphor that a lot of people breaking trail are running an integral OS yeah and I think some of the simplest thing is a the complexity of thinking in those ways the valuing that there are interior experiences that are as important and map and track as exterior experiences and that things that we might talk about in the realms of policy government business you know aka sort of third-person structures are also informed by and connected to culture and interior psychology and just that ability I mean fundamentally the four quadrants of Ken's model there's insides and outsides of singulars and plurals that alone I think is game-changing and then a few others if you know what Ken calls the pre Tron's fallacy you'd like don't confuse irrational things with post rational things and particularly you know the terrain that we read about in a stealing fire talking about the psychedelic Renaissance the explosion and state seeking and non-ordinary states like wim HOF and breathing you name it really this kind of immense hunger these days for all things non ordinary is really important to distinguish between what is regressive and just going back to kind of magical thinking and what is progressive we're truly stepping into some increasingly complex and helpful new ways of looking at stuff and you mentioned a few there but what do you think of a are the really crucial pieces that integral provides what are the what are the most important parts of that integral os I think I just named them really I mean I think it's the idea of interiors and exteriors and they're they're equally important to be considered that notion of the pre trans fallacy don't confuse less sophisticated things for more sophisticated things simply because they're not standard business as usual the notions of adult development or vertical development were both I think they were helpfully wrong is the simplest way to say it and I was actually just having a conversation with Zack Stein who studied at Harvard did his doctorate under Bob Keegan and some of the other developmental theorists and you know Ken's model which he then kind of piggy back to spiral dynamics and those kinds of things the idea that there's such a thing as second-tier that second tier is this momentous leap that if you're even here this conference we're reading this book aka one of us you are parentheses at least cognitively at second tier I think that created far more problems than it's solved and it basically was like crack for Asperger's kids you know the idea of getting a contact high from reading Ken's stuff and getting to see yourself on a map and position yourself up and away from no matter what the disclaimers were and there were plenty of disclaimers the reality as that showed up in culture and in practice resulted in a bunch of dissociated eggheads masquerading as as Jedi and thinking that they could solve the world from the of a whiteboard and that I think was you know part of the cracks in the foundation I guess I was relatively late to to discovering Ken's work and I've been very impressed with it but it but I also get a sense like a lot of integral forums or integral conversations just tend to degenerate into I'm more integral than you this sort of integral one-up developmental one-upmanship yeah and that was what was sort of precious about it you know within the integral kind of core community you know Ken talking about things that were awkward kosher you know on the one nine totally get it a rigorous rigorous methodology you want to make sure people aren't cutting corners or sloppily applying it but that rigidity then led to effectively aqua Maoism where the only things that got the stamp of approval were some of the most derivative unimaginative like let me take the discipline or vertical I'm apart of let me run it through the aqua sausage grinder spit out all the you know the expected truisms and critiques and I've added nothing of substance to my field but I've just complied with the certification on the top and I think there were only a handful of people that I was aware of Sean Huggins was one Zach Stein was another there were the number of people who were actually creating unique or interesting content within the Aqua world outside of Kenan was very low and I think part of that was the you know this is pre blockchain plea pre emphasis on D central is a decentralized sense-making or collective intelligence so it was very hierarchically throttled and I think that choked a lot of the potential messy but essential life that's now happened since outside the walls of that close could close container and is that because eventually many people kind of confuse the map for the territory so you just end up loading it you end up having to produce in a certain language and a certain set of dogmas that then crushes the life out of the emergent phenomenon or what is it well I think I think your description of what happened it was yes that if for sure became a relatively lifeless regurgitation of kind of just compliance on the models which was too bad because ideally those models kind of can crack open places that are stuck in a field or a discipline and then and it allowed new shoots to grow the map not meeting the territory was just one of the grandest ironies of the integral movement because it was parotid all the time by the people who were 100% obsessed with the map and not getting outside and roaming around and so that was another things it felt like there was a a very strong bifurcation but the people who were drawn to the integral movement and on the one hand much smaller number but essential to the life of the movement were people who were actually arguably already awake or realized themselves in the sense that they were living in the territory and and then there were all the sort of late majority of the people who were drawn by the contact hiya Ken's writings and the methodology itself and because of Ken's broad sweep because of his synthetic analysis of a lot of disciplines all of this and because of the sort of confidence bordering on hubris with which he held forth and proclaimed the nature of things if somebody hadn't done their own primary research and wasn't deeply versed in the disciplines that he was presuming to speak of they took his his synthesis and analysis as gospel and never went back and did the hard work of reading the original sources and drawing their own companions or triangulating between other experts and leaders in those given disciplines but the folks that felt like they were walking the turret like I don't I'm not sure integral actually woke anybody up so point was you know the same way the critique of Christ as he made Christians not Christ Buddha made Buddhists not Buddha's you know that the Bruce Lee didn't make another Bruce Lee so lineage of the son of a bitch but the people that I experienced and valued the most who were a light with their own lived experience came from what I could tell from the Adi Dada lineage there was a bunch of those including Sophia Diaz David da data some of some of those folks Thierry Patton they were they were folks that had clearly been lit up by a transmitter in the past chögyam trungpa was another linear source where people were drawn to this work but had been sparked previously potentially some Osho although I didn't have one-on-one direct recognition of those folks in the mix and that was my sense is that the people who were already awake got there some by other means and then were drawn to that work post facto to explain their own lived experience and the people who were drawn to it purely from the intellectual line or domain it simply entrenched them even further in hyper cognition and disembodiment then it set them free yeah because I I feel I mean when I introduced you in the beginning I said I thought you were holding a really important piece and that from reading stealing fire and spending a little bit of time with you I think is that embodied flow state get out of your minds get into the the liminal experience which is something I really identify with with the piece that you're bringing and that's the piece you say that was not present with integral yeah I mean you know we've all got our biases so we for sure you know we can only become more of what we are he was a Eastern non-dual meditator so out of all traditions he wildly privileged those and he was a weightlifter body builder judo so so that became his triangle of proving it to academia Eastern and particularly you know some Shen and some varying other fairly esoteric spaces saying that those were the pinnacle of the Eastern contemplative tract and there is nothing but non dual suchness and then like I'm yoked you know and this is this is embodiment and so those just became you know we all come in through certain doorways but as he justified those to the exclusion of other things I think that's when his his laser beams became a little tunnel focused I mean one classic examples I remember him dismissing the entire Burning Man culture and movement as deep red which in the terminology of spiral dynamics was son a very primitive and tribal so very very low down the ladder of what could be cool and you know six or seven steps below second-tier or integral the the domain that he and his community were claiming and the reality was he hadn't been and he had done it by reading the ten principles wrote that time maybe there were six or seven but what he you know completely just missed and that assessment was those were lowest common denominator rules upon which a full rainbow of descriptions and expressions were also taking place so it was that kind of you know when all you gots a hammer everything looks like a nail when all you've gots a hyper cognitive complex map that dice X things all you've got our parts and pieces even if there's something vibrant that's not in your personal preference but might be an emerging thing of interest to keep tabs on do you think that the the developmental piece and in particular the the kind of color based value systems piece is useful to get out of the culture war dynamic mmm I mean just like an understanding of those different mimetic value systems and how they interact perceive each other that kind of thing yeah I mean the first thing is I think that you know spiral dynamics sort of firmly jump the shark when can change the colors to align with the chakras that would be the place I would back it off run and while you're at it you might as well leave dawn graves behind and go all done back and go all the way back to Clare graves if you want an understanding of spiral dynamics it lost all of its nuance and most of its usefulness by the time that got simplified into the versions that most people are conversing with today so that said you know back to you know hard lessons learned from the field in the management consulting space we initially introduced spiral dynamics levels of development and of course every hyper agentic peak orange business achiever you know type-a personality instantly looks at any map model or ranking system and sees themselves at the top and either insists they already are there or wants to get there as soon as fuckin possible and so several years of spectacular wipeouts and organizational shit shows as a result of introducing that we actually deliberately broke the ladder and then rearrange the colors and laid them out horizontally and said these are different mindsets or worldviews here's how you message as different mindsets and do so with basically equal embrace of all the humans and humanity contained therein so the challenge with any of these vertical models is good old-fashioned human nature it's dr. Seuss and yertle the turtle you know I want to be king of the palm so stack me up as high as I can go on the backs of all the other turtles and you know arguably the only people that can really hold a hierarchic ranking system and not succumb to egoic by passing are the people who no longer need it or you know deeply embodied it already so as far as Ken's Ken's discussion of the mean green mean I mean I think it's I think it's cultural analysis of pathological baby-boomer value systems is spot-on and weirdly I thought there was a bullet in that son of a bitch in the in the early to mid 90s I thought like post-modernism had officially crawled up its own asshole and died and that was the time I was in graduate school in the social sciences you know we kind of ran that sucker off the cliff but what's interesting is that Millennials are now reviving what Ken calls Boomer Aegeus or the Mean Green meme and what is even more problematic about the Millennials cut out it is they didn't even build it in the first place they just inherited it and so they don't even know what it was built in opposition to aka 1950s 1960s class warfare militarization gender emergence social Awakening etc they just take it as their birthright of the way things should be so weirdly I thought that Ken was fighting the last war on on kind of on boomer Aegis or the Mean Green meme it has come back like a zombie and is now completely infecting social justice warrior kind of stuff and the far-left reactionary movements these days that said from the developmental perspective I think and and this is not normally what kin did but I think his his discussion of green in all of those caricatured pathological ways it's not in keeping with the rest of the academic literature on individualist the individualist stage which is what some of the jain Levenger and suzanne cook writer and others who were the actual academics in this field looked at and the individualist stage AKA green is actually much more comprehensive and has lots of pro-social and overall positive capacities and developments and I feel like in Ken's labeling it of MGM mean green mean boomer itis whatever you want to call it that a lot of that got eclipsed not just in his own critique and analysis but in an awful lot of people following him and so I think that was problematic now that said ah things like alright and far left culture wars that are happening today can you know can we gain some insights from looking at that lenses or colors of cultural you know pneumatics yes does it give us any powerful or profound insights as to what to do about it no not as sure and what else did you learn from trying to I guess enact integral theory at the hard at the sharp end well the simplest is just no one gives a shit right you can be as clever as you want and business leaders any any anybody in actual life whether it's here's the 17 different levels of parenting and how to bring your little shot you know people want to know how do I keep my baby who's colicky crying tonight how do I get them to sleep and when you bring it into a business situation I mean we we brought some of the most comprehensive fully dimension aqua kosher approaches into businesses and quite often even had the you know fully drank the kool-aid buy-in of the CEOs / founders so we had cut lunch in a way that you never do in bigger companies or coming in through HR to do a training like we had massive permission to play and we did everything from Bobby bodily stuff to communication practices to maps and models to theories I mean just did it all and destroyed shareholder value wasted so much time ended up you know blowing out the backs of those engagements a year later 18 months later because we were costing a ton of money and taking a ton of time enforcing enforcing that people develop grow up take on tools and models that had no clear relevance to their business their work or their lives and no one could handle that much change while still doing their day jobs so as a result of that like we kept on pruning and simplifying and pruning and simplifying till five years later we didn't even talk about the quadrants the simplest element of Ken's stuff we just simply talked about and we didn't then then we reduced the four to the three we call it the I that we in the it then realized that was even too abstract we called it individuals teams and organizations so like Dorothy and The Wizard of Oz you know we had to go all the way through integral complexity to come back to using terms that were pretty self-evident there's employees there's groups of employees and there's all of us together in this company we run and work in and so by the time you could break it down to terms that were actionable and useful in the real world as people actually lived and worked in the real world you're back to truisms and and really kind of self-evident common-sense things which is fine but there was 10 years there where and Fred Kaufmann was another one he founded a company called excellent none of them worked and and neither did I integral Institute as a business and that's not to say that you know money and profits are the sole thing but if one of the truth claims is this model or theory is more sophisticated complex and inclusive therefore more effective and organizations like the UN ought to be adopting it to solve the problems of the world and you can't even create a cash flow positive business out of it that should be a signal that something's not quite right in what's going on and how would you summarize that not quite right well I mean again I think you know that notion of like crack fries burgers kids it's just too clever for its own fucking good and that's not to say that certain clever people want to think in that way or right in that way or even read read things written in that way but it is to have some humility of the sort of everybody's got a plan until they get hit you know Mike Tyson 101 and it was it was almost the equivalent of you know like in Raiders of the Lost Ark you know Indiana Jones goes out into that Moroccan square and there's that black Saracen and he's whips out his scimitar and does all this fancy ass stuff and then that you know Indy just picks out his gun and shoots him right and and that's kind of life and you know aqwal theory was a little bit like the dude with the scimitar which is an awful lot of arm waving without nearly enough practical grounded connection to the task at hand and do you have any other criticisms or thoughts about it yeah I mean you know there's been lots of solid and methodical breakdowns of you know where integral Theory got out over its key specifically its orienting generalizations and you know presuming to define entire academic disciplines with a certain straw man that then would get knocked down I think ken was clearly strongest in the realm of developmental psychology and Eastern Kentucky of traditions and that and that's and that's his earlier work for the most part and it's you know that's where I think he was really drawing from his wheelhouse the so there's critiques there kind of within the ad within the frameworks and that's been done but the biggest one the biggest - for me we're simply the notion of it didn't work as a business nor did any other businesses find ways to make it work so just pure proof of concept product market fit and the other one which i think is as big is one of integrals biggest you know true claims to fame was that Eastern contemplative traditions are partial because they don't address psychological shadow Western psychological traditions don't address non-dual ness or or sort of attainment and integral is the best of both worlds because we have non giannis with awareness of shadow and then ken promptly went on to endorse every fucked up dysfunctional guru on the planet pretty much I mean I mean maybe this was our field so we certainly knew these ones but everyone from not backing away from Adi da to King and co-leading everything under the Sun with Andrew Cohen to mock Gaffney to gampa Roshi to robert augustus market masters i mean the list was pretty much endless as to the the gurus with feats of clay and and that's problematic because if the very thing we said we could do we consistently spectacularly fail at ourselves to say nothing of ken himself and the blind spots of the single you know the hero with a thousand helpers business model if it's not helping us do the very thing we claim it does better than anything else that's a problem why do you think that happened that specifically I mean obviously it's the humans involved and and on some level is there some mutual back scratching as peers and colleagues agree to come to be complicit together on each other's platforms to further increase their reach and scope and you know business and incomes for sure and that happens even more these days with Instagram likes and podcasts reach and all that kind of stuff so I think there's many times that people will look the other way over small things and large because of reach and scope and mutual benefit but I think fundamentally it's it's it was hubris and and anybody that proclaims a model of everything is gonna miss something that something doesn't show up on that map and it's fundamentally I mean for me my sensory is anything that presumes a pinnacle attainment the moment said you know the moment a teacher hints implies or outright states but they have achieved a zone of realization that is extraordinary first you know I think that you set yourself up for the bifurcation the accumulation of shadow it seems I mean you basically just hinted at that there like this this Eastern model of enlightenment as a kind of final destination just seems to be is that the problem because it seems that as soon as any personal organization is built around that model it just almost invariably seems to end up in shadow yeah I mean I think that's one of the biggest problems in the sort of spiritual marketplace in general and whether it's Byron Katie Eckhart Tolle Jed McKenna any of the kind of like crypto neo Vedanta you know the idea that kind of like the world is illusory it's all in your mind and just changing your mind is gonna change everything and often smuggle in together with that is something along the lines of there is such a thing as instantaneous irreversible enlightenment and I think whether or not there are humans on the planet at any point in time that have achieved something like that is a whole other question but I think it's a shitty teaching technique regardless and so because what happens is the moment a person in the position of authority has claimed irreversible state of perfectibility then all shadow that arises in the intersubjective the conversations and the living between you and me is now no longer me and it has to all be you and then even when there's clearly some stuff I'm doing this batshit crazy out of line I can't go hey you're right I had a bad I have to hold behind that Plexiglas wall and say I must I'm still perfect therefore I did that on purpose therefore even though it seemed like a shitty thing it's actually crazy wisdom in service of your awakening and therein that's the beginning of the end and so every time I come across any teacher or teaching that is making any claims along those lines you like don't go near it no matter how alive a light shining no matter how much they're waking people up with charismatic transmission it just feels problematic and so that's why teachers like Pema Chodron you know who emphasize our humanity you know I mean I think in a nutshell I think spirituality is wildly overrated and I think our core humanity is wildly underrated and so the teachers that I can get behind other ones Pema Chodron Alice Walker as you know it's just a wisdom holder adyashanti like folks who are like yeah this is it this is us and and get used to it and the way out is through the way out is down and in up and away those those experiences just feel more honest to me and we don't end up in the schizoid effort to reconcile than that the utter tragedy that is the human experience with all of these ascendant so-called spiritual states or experiences do you think I'm guessing the answer might well be no but do you think that integral has some relevance or could could still be relevant to the conversation today yeah I mean it's a great question in some respects the advice I always give folks is I think that integral theory should be deeply studied and then promptly forgotten you know like keep it as kind of operating system virusscan keep it as kind of pegs to hang things on keep it in or use it as a sort of rubric against which you check to make sure you're not missing something obvious but in general the I just don't think that life submits to that form of false precision very well or helpfully it does feel like in fact a buddy of ours a co-author with Ken on his integral life practice book Adam Leonard is one of the lead executive development folks at Google now and we were just having a conversation a couple of weeks ago and he and he's been having great traction lately bringing in integrally informed concepts into the executive leadership at Google framed around VUCA conditions volatile uncertain complex ambiguous and the idea that we need to increase our complexity of sense-making in order to handle the challenges ahead and frame that way and filtered that way I think that integral insights and perspectives are invaluable but simply dumped wholesale on the table and said build with this because it's better hasn't worked out as well as it might and and the final piece is you know implicit really one of the sent the long tentpoles of the integral argument is the growth to goodness idea the idea that in vertical development we end up moving up the spiral or moving up the ladder whatever the metaphor is going to be and that going from first tier to second tier second tier is better going from you know the green mean to teal or purple or you know aqua or whatever he was calling it at the lost last count is better and there was an implicit idea that we become more sage like more enlightened more compassionate more of all the good pro-social things that we value as humanity and the jury is very much out on that the jury's a very much out on developmental theory as a true model Zack Stein has been talking about interestingly kind of the acquisition of skills an ecosystem of self that the higher reached its states of awareness being meaning-making etcetera are temporary vulnerable dependent on environment depending on scaffolding that we can be up in these places at different times in different aspects of ourselves and you can have high-functioning sociopath you can have you know Nazis were infinitely more complex than Yanomami tribesmen in the Amazon and they didn't just make trains run on time right and so then there's been research on the spread of EQ or emotional intelligence training and findings that the worst thing you can possibly do is teach EQ skills to sociopaths and Psychopaths and pick up culture was a you know hat which has weird overlaps with the integral community via some of the communication dialogue processes started out as pickup artistry and so you realize that you know a hundred percent use of the force gives you Yoda and ninety-nine percent use of the force gives you death they do and so I think it's really critical back to like our humanity is that I would take an old grandma in her rocking chair on the front porch sharing rootsy down-home wisdom it's not complex at all you know over sum over cognitive asshat you know trying to map things in Tetra arising dimensions and and the same thing with you know second tier men in particular who so imbalanced in their embodiment and even their you know absolutely lack of backbone and conviction I'd rather deal with you know blue like honor Duty courage sacrifice men who recognize that there is in fact something bigger than their own experience or process to live and die for and then you're just like hey gotcha that's all so now can we expand what it is you bow down to all right can we just add the computer some possibility to the thing you serve verse is trying to find men in you know men the men from Marin right who are so about counting the angels on the head of a pin that their balls in their backbone are nowhere to be found and I'm going to take longer than we've got to grow anew do you have anything that you would say to Ken himself hmm well bottom line thank you thank you for living your life expressing your Dhamma taking that bad ass mind of yours and using it to split atoms and map reality you know I think you you've informed a generation of thinkers beers and doers and I think the world is absolutely a better place for you having walked your walk and thought your thoughts because of it as I said at the beginning the the nature of the the internet and the the kind of emergent conversation is that it has to be two-way and there is a sense with I know that there's a sense within a lot of people who are following integral that integral needs to be part of this conversation it needs to be part of the developmental framework for example would really help inform the intellectual darkweb argument but I think for that to happen it would also need for integral and Ken to be open to to feedback into dialogue in a way that perhaps we haven't seen so far do you think that they are open to that yeah I mean I haven't touched base in that world and honestly I mean my sense where where it can lost the most relevance other than the kind of collapse of integral Institute was in the no longer going ban I get it like when you've got a complex thought structure and you're interested on the leading edge of your newest ideas having to go back and re-establish all this all the stepping stones it's just a ball lake and for him to be discussing you know almost glibly chakra systems or subtle energy or things that are very far off the reservation even skeptical enthusiasts and discussing them as if they are established facts that to me is problematic you're like okay you've broken with any efforts to maintain relevance to the middle of the bell curve including including someone like me who just prefer a sort of agnostic Gnosticism he prefers a kind of rational mysticism versus taking other things on lock stock and barrel the the feedback loops I haven't seen can being open to it and I think there's legitimate peevishness on his part in the same way that Jordan Peterson clearly got increasingly kind of hijacked and reactive you know before and immediately after the launch of his book as he was a taking and Sam Harris for that matter right just potshots and slings and arrows and at some point you take a swipe at the ankle-biters and so you know critiques it can you know that it's the wheat from the chaff really like the critiques of Ken that are just inflammatory reactionary don't get it caricature typecast yeah you know what yeah that's a waste of time to have to sift through those if you've got actual Dhamma real work to go and do but the considered open-hearted critiques have to be met with something more than you just don't understand the model or you're misinterpreting it has to be like okay I've got my boat the ship I'm steering through the water and I've got my wake and I don't always notice my wake but if it's upsetting other people's boats if it's slamming up against dachshunds whomping picnics I need to take responsibility for that and I think that that piece somewhere between the non-dual and the and the psychological is that is the span where ken was actually had the least vision and that was the messy human parts of how we get this done together and there and the way we inform and are informed by each other and where is the cutting edge of the conversation now where where should people go to if integral felt like the cutting edge of the conversation in sort of 90s 2000s where is that cutting edge right now do you think well I mean I think topically that thing that I'm trying to track them most right now and I think it's essential for our collective future and one and the least developed is the culture that we began mapping and stealing fire but is clearly showing up in a lot of different ways around the world and in the intellectual dark web is a part of it yeah which is what is the emergence of transpersonal collective emergent culture so specifically what happens when we get together and basically connect in serial almost like a bunch of computers to create a collective supercomputer that is non hierarchical there's not one person at the top of that pyramid and that's not flattening that's not to say we're all gonna get an endless process and share our feelings this dynamic subordination it is a high-functioning collaborative process so what does basically what do basically ethical cults look like you know if you had traditional cults were you know like the loose Tinian mysteries of the Dionysian cult or anything like that through history just from an anthropological perspective that was subjugation of self to the lineage which of the tradition and then we ended up with culty cults you know which was Charles Manson and Jim Jones and potentially Andrew Cohen and some and audio and some of these others and that was subjugation of the self to the Guru who was a ronin they were they were not they were not a samurai with the dojo they just taken their own claim and said I am God realized and that was obviously wildly problematic but we sort of Rini to reclaim the original intentions cultist from latin just means to worship and what happens when we get together and worship or experience ecstasy speak experiences together how do we make ethical cults where the individual is not subsumed but actually the serenity of every individual is paramount and then we collect in we connect in co-creative emergence that is a son of a bitch and I haven't seen anybody outside of you know a week or two building a camp at Burning Man or you know high-performing sports teams or special operations I mean they think the only places I've seen it have been in temporary or explicitly performance-driven meaning they're high-performing teams professional basketball or hockey or suddenly that or special operations and if you can cut it in that game of dynamic subordination you're out and the next person who can has put in place and so to do this in egalitarian non hierarchical community we live in an urban area together we're trying to make sense of that we are building an intentional community together and we're all in this together anything that doesn't mean I can just can you when you underperform I haven't yet seen us figure that out so for me that's the cutting edge of this conversation is we all know enough to be dangerous how do we get together and and make newer and more complicated mistakes together not repeat the old ones that really tracks with I guess we're where we're at as well on the channel people like Jordan green halt yourself Daniel shmatte Tim burger the question is how do we create into subject genuine into subjective sense making yeah and it's a son of a bitch and what you said earlier about like how quickly would the aqwal seemed of devoted to who's more integral than thou who has privileged claims truth claims to source whatever the source this subscribes source can be and it can be aqwal theory it could be five Meo DMT and the fine and the hyperspace gods it could be it doesn't really matter what gets posited up there but the moment that becomes the vehicle by which we're all supposed to gather together we still have discernment judgment trade offs allocation of power money resources sexuality you name it all the tribal monkey stuff and as soon as it devolves in any way shape or form to a either exclusive claims of weapon Asst right I mean and I I have abiding and unchallengeable access to source or is just a shit show dogfight every time that's when any emergence collapses and we're back to game theory 101 and and I have not seen any way around that other than potentially couples and I'd like this is super provisional but potentially like couples then connecting to each other and attempting to maybe do this in groups of say 12 you know like 12 humans 12 couples not sure but the ante as Daniel would say the Antti decoherence the attendance II of us to actually stay in it together when everything wants to fling us or drive us apart I don't think that Burning Man culture is adequate for it I don't think that nonviolent communication is adequate for it I mean in my own experience everything I've got with my partner including decades under the bridge growing up together two children that we know and love and know that we would harm if we ever broke apart right vibrant personal intimate practice together reassert like literally making love all the time and adding that to the tank like we have every reason in the world to stay in this through the hardest stuff and it still gets down to metal on metal and there's times where it's like fuck you fuck this I'm out so knowing my own experience where like it's like holy shit we have everything on our side everything possible you know to help us stay together and it's still the liveliest ride of our lives how how on earth are we gonna do this at scale is a question I think about every day [Music] you
