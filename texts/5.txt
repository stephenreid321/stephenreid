[Music] so many of the people whose thought I'm following most closely have have had similar have ended up in a very similar place in terms of what you might call into subjective sense making or how do we come into coherence with each other to make sense of the world together and I'd like to why have you ended up in this space and what's your journey been to get to this place I mean I I mean the short answer is no idea look I think we're all just here and but if I had to kind of attempt to assemble some plausible narrative I think it's just that you know none of us live in a vacuum and we all we are all you know intrinsically social creatures and I think there is some you know even before we get together to talk about in some shared sense making that we're all needed and none of the challenges that at least you know as you talked about the people you're following that kind of people who are thinking and writing and speaking and teaching around these things I think it's all fairly clear that you know to to to quote cuing long all right where we go one we go all and that's not just batshit dudes on the hall right that are coming to that conclusion and I think that's part of why that's such a resonant rallying cry for that community is he's not wrong and so that sense that we better figure out a none of us have all the pieces and we better figure out how to share exchange integrate and operationalize all of the pieces almost feels like table stakes assumptions these days so there's a lot of work that I'm familiar with through kind of counseling and trauma work around somatic experiencing polyvagal theory and it's all about how we come into connection with each other especially polyvagal theory which is basically saying that we're either in a an exploratory framework where we're able and open for connection with others or in a defensive framework and I have a real sense that were is essential to come into a sort of broader consciousness maybe into sort of understanding why conversations break down because we're in a culture of the moment or the conversation just keep seeming to break down again and again and again and this kind of understanding like the neurophysiology of coherence or the neurophysiology of connection seems really vital in that do you what's your take on that yeah I mean I would almost I mean short answer is yes because there's no there's no opportunity for tribal primates to be in coherence without that also having a you know showing up in the kind of stack of our bodies and brains for sure so for what we want is the ability to have a nice conversation together the ability for us to have that nice conversation sits on the foundation all right of bodies and brains and hearts and minds in achievement not whether that's simple things like mirror neurons or it's more complicated things like overall neurophysiological resonance that is for sure another lever for us to play with so you know the Business School East sodding in Spain that we wrote about in a stealing fire the idea that they took a strategic business problem and had a bunch of MBA students try and solve it together you know with one-way mirrors and biometrics tracking them on all this kind of stuff and they figured I could who are the emerging leaders in this group and and they backed out statistically you know how much people talked how loudly people talked the words they used even what they actually had to say about solving the problem none of that stuff was statistically as significant as the fact that that those leaders those emergent leaders couldn't regulate their own nervous systems and do it in a way that entrained other people into their states so it's a little bit like that old story of you know Galileo entering the watchmakers shop and seeing you know all the all the clocks on the wall swinging in time with the one with the longest pendulum so that idea of the longest pendulum and trains all the others into that field that to me has been my inquiry really on the sort of biohacking spaces what's the longest pendulum our bodies if we had to pick and there's a gajillion things we can map track measure from brain waves to heart rate to heart rate variability to new chemistry to posture to respiration African you know get all sorts but what are the one or two or three that if you get those right the entire rest of our bodies and brains cascades into coherence and then that's a strong signal that's now that's lengthened our pendulum and now we are far more likely to bring others into that coherent state and so before we get to kind of what we know you might call communitas or like a highly coherent group presencing something greater than the sum of the parts my sense is that when we try we get there occasionally particularly from a shed peak state or experience we kind of experience a bit but then it comes undone it is unstable and it breaks down and it you know it's almost a truism that it breaks down because of our trauma I have ego based stuff personality stuff I've lived a story where I'm I'm either have to be in charge or I've never seen in love don't you know me and everything in between and at some point in the game somebody hits a few wrong notes things that unspooling and we all go back into our habituated patterns and overwhelming majority of you know 20th century early 21st century efforts to deal with trauma if it's ever dealt with it all often it's not is verbal linguistic psychoanalytic it's let's talk about our feelings let's talk about our pain let's talk about all this stuff but you mentioned the body keeps the score and the vessel vendor is it bender under coke vessel vendor coke you know he makes the case and I think it's 100% valid and he would by the way the fellow who actually got PTSD defined and coined and entered into the dsm 3 i think was at the time so in the sort of father of PTSD in a research and therapy the idea is a little bit you can't fix a problem that the level it wasn't created so if you're dealing with pre verbal or nonverbal trauma to yourself system talking about it isn't gonna get rid of it in fact talking about it can further calcified and reify it even further which is why I oftentimes there's nobody more neurotic and more self-obsessed than the person who's logged lots of Freudian cashton all they've done is polish and perfect the gems of their suffering so if we're looking for how do we get a bunch of people into coherent States and nobody shits the bed we actually have to get the out of our bodies and our system and so nonverbal trauma release methods tend to be I think again you know archimedes one on one the longer lever from which we can move the world and if we can get pre verbal pre psychological pre-die-cut right it's how you and I are actually feeling in relationship and resonance or dissonance with each other and then the words the ideas all that good stuff will come as a byproduct of that more foundational step and so that is an area that fascinated by and really we're trying you know I'm exploring for my next book which is what's kind of a unified field of high-impact evidence-based trauma relief and integration so we can be better more joyful more resourced humans but also so that we can get together play together and stay together more consistently than we have been I've got a friend called Alex Evans who used to be a advisor for the British government in climate change and many different kind of hot-button topics and he became quite disillusioned with how the conversations kept breaking down and now he's gone away and researched a lot of this stuff that's all under Cole polyvagal theory and I've realized and this is the core key piece that we need to understand before we can kind of solve most of the problems yeah do you do you agree with that yeah I mean I've actually had several recent somewhat you know puzzling saddening frustrating experiences in groups of rarified you know these are down to you know Caribbean islands with famous billionaires to solve ocean conservation or gather of you know wealth holders and wisdom keepers so indigenous elders plus high net-worth families and family offices with you know everybody with incredibly good intentions and saw one hijacked in a heartbeat around gender and sort of me two issues which was not the topic of conversation and another one about ocean conservation hijacked around race and you're like we're here to try and save the oceans this isn't even a human dynamic and someone would the tiniest propagation got triggered into a personal trauma response and then into a socio-political ideological trauma response and just kicked the entire house of cards down and you realize oh  we have to figure that part out and and if and and my sense is is you know Ben Franklin you know when they signed the Declaration of Independence he said alright gentlemen and I said yes he said the republic if you can keep it let that bit that everybody knows but he also said we must all hang together or we shall assuredly hang separately and so that's where we are right now and so identity politics which are it which is fundamentally a group of collectively traumatized folks forming an identity around that trauma right identity politics of all stripes and this doesn't matter left or right they can be in cells outright 4chan wack nuts or it could be social justice warriors right and and and that entire community I would I would advocate that community on the progressive left is right they absolutely all those folks all those dispossessed out groups have been subject to abuses of long term entrenched power over time they're just not being effective at all and in fact there are the only people they're the only people that they are harming is the center left for well-intentioned progressives who do have access to the instruments of patriarchy post colonial oppression money markets platform and those are the only Pope's there even subject give a about that critique centre-right is saying oh no that's way too extreme for my value sets my position my experience so I'm actually getting pushed away and alright is gleefully trolling the libs and watching this circular firing squad on the Left go down and weaponizing all the tools of postmodern classical academia whether that's freedom of speech or help help I'm being oppressed or my voice must be heard too and they're actually just turning and weaponizing the tools of the progressive left against themselves so it is a stock rating shitshow all around and the key is is if I go back into my trauma and even my in groups the shared experience of trauma and the stories around them and I said any it's a little bit like kids playing you know sort of all day monopoly games back in the day you know when wouldn't you run out of banknotes and then you'd start having to write IOU it's like I owe you 1 million extra dollars for landing on board or gourmet fare or whatever it would be right at some point we have to come to the conclusion that my i/o use what's owed me to fill the hole I believe I have from those traumatic experiences is dwarfed by the potential pain and suffering we're all staring at coming down the pike if we don't get our together and learn to hang together so identity politics are a structural roadblock right now in from anything resembling group coherence on a collective mobilized scale and I think the only way through it and people experience this as well because there were in that wisdom keepers wealth holders retreat that I was invited to attend and speak at there were Lakota and DNA elders so from the Navajo community and the Lakota Sioux communities and there and actually also someone from Guyana so so the experiencing you know all sorts of kind of both African Diaspora into you know South American colonial expression and their effect was fundamentally different than the San Francisco's social justice warrior fundamentally different they had act and arguably had been experiencing far more egregious oppression and trauma for many for even more generations but they had come out on the other side of love and they had come out on the other side of open embrace and it wasn't squishy it wasn't new agey it was fierce and it was unapologetically in that stand but it was integrated you could absolutely tell integrated humans from wounded activists and the integrated humans is what Martin Luther King called soul force and they were sourcing from soul force and it was palpable I mean Here I am two months later still talking about that experience that three or four days with those people and how much it's impacted just my thinking and feeling about these subjects so the question is is can we create catharsis right the except the metabolizing of our trauma the digesting of our grief such that I'm no longer separate in my pain body and my narrative that wraps me around that and can I experience both my wholeness my enoughness and potentially my connectivity to self to community to society to plan it and be on whatever the levels I choose or am able to access and from there can we learn to play this bigger game together and if we sit if we only have words to talk about it never gonna get done if we have access to neuro physiological resets then we can potentially come back to stop figuring out how to play this game together a little bit more skillfully with much higher Boz for what triggers us into decompensated States it's funny because I've written a question here is identity politics incompatible with coherence and you already preempted it yeah well the other thing about identity politics again just on a developmental psychological level right identity politics is a regression into ethnocentric and egocentric centers of gravity it's saying I heard we hurt your fault their fault so it is by by sort of design it is fragmentary and and fractional if you and what we have to do no question about it both from a simple strategic level but also arguably from a cultural and humanitarian level we have to make the next step to global century consciousness have to the problems are wicked and complex they they don't observe ethnic linguistic Geographic political boundaries right we have to be thinking of that and you think okay how on earth do we get to global centric consciousness at scale and the only instances we've had our sort of saints and stages so tiny tiny fractions of percentages on the leading edge if you marry well who knows how they've done that most religious traditions aren't very good at repeating those are those lucky leaders they sort of born not made or occasionally pop through so we haven't figured out how to open source that part you think okay well what about the little blue marble the flyover effect of astronauts and everybody's familiar with like the Apollo astronauts and how many in seeing the Sun come up over this little blue planet of ours and seeing the Amazon and the Great Wall of China and the you know and the Nile and go holy right I am a human that is our home we are all connected and the boundaries and the separations are ephemeral they're illusory that experience we can't all hop on SpaceX or Virgin Galactic just logistically not gonna happen so can we instead of being astronauts to precipitate that flyover effect of global centric perspective can we become not astronauts but Psychonauts is there a chance we're by doing interior work and having interior experiences I experienced the dissolution of myself I experienced the connection to something bigger than me and that can I come back to do that but the lead the lead anchors present preventing that is our undigested grief it is the trauma we carry with us and and it's not that we have to become perfect we don't all have to become Saints and Yogi's but we just have to have the ability to say okay I defrag my nervous system and I'm 80/20 woke to broke I'm 80% like oh yeah this is what it's like to stand tall oh yeah this is what it's like to feel enough to even feel joy possibility whatever right and am I done yet no I'm not done yet I'm probably never gonna be done figuring all that out ironing out all the kinks the bumps the scrapes in fact the scars are what make me me but I've got enough that I remember what's possible and I have a felt sense of what it's like to move beyond that skin encapsulated you go move beyond my stories move beyond seeking pleasure and avoiding pain to play a bigger game by choice on purpose with others and if we can get there then maybe we've got a shot you know and just before when we were talking about kind of coming into coherence with each other you talked about neuro neuro physiological resets what what are those yeah well I mean and this is the this is the research I'm doing for my next book but it's basically the idea of again you can do all sorts of things in the lab you can do all sorts of things with 10 million dollars in a kit and a fancy retreat center or a research project or you know or you know Dafa you know kind of you know multi-year study or something my interest is in what is cheap to free what is open source meaning almost everybody who would want to can have access to it and what's scalable kind of the first to you know put into gear and so if you take a look at I think you can kind of run a fairly straightforward thought experiment which is you're like okay well if it has to mean all those things it probably already exists in our bodies or you know we either carry around with us or it's simple protocols we can adopt with a minimum of tools and spend and you also think okay what are the things that are evolutionarily encoded because if we can judo flip those things to higher better uses we have a real chance of what you just got to let them you want a lot of an inertia hit that you can harness and redirect so a couple of examples you know the simplest is respiration we are biologically encoded to breathe damn it right and oxygen is the fuel for your Ronal computation as well as all of our cellular health and growth so and you know if you try and hold your breath for as long as you can and then you get you know what they call ibm's involuntary breathing movements or rhythmic even look that kind of gulping swallowing thing you get when you're a kid playing that game and you think oh you finally take a gospel bear anything I I wish I was out of oxygen well you want you actually have 50% oxygen in your tank still at that time what you have had is an excessive carbon dioxide buildup and our brain is like Mayday Mayday Red Alert red alert get more air dumbass because you might sometime minutes from now cook it and expire so we've built in that massive buffer right of overwhelming imperative to do the thing well if you can take that and you know folks like wim HOF the Iceman who's you know roaming the world leading breathing and ice bath workshops and those kind of things what is he harnessing what is he hacking he's hacking respiration and basically if you just realized that changing the balance of nitrogen oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood streams completely changes our consciousness we can up regulate if we sort of if worth tired or depressed or we're about to go onstage or give a performance or something like that we can up regulate our nervous systems usually by faster more potent breathing if we're stressed out and we're trembling and we just need to calm down to go to sleep or again to give a presentation or to do anything else that we need to do we can with slower vagal nose breathing where our exhales are much longer than our inhales we can down regulate our nervous system we can increase our vagal nerve tone and our vagal nerve just goes from our brain through our heart all the way down to our route and it modulates much of our nervous system and therefore our experience so and if you want to you know really get interesting you can hyperventilate or do other breathing practices that completely transcend your waking state consciousness and profound non ordinary state experiences and so that's an example which is cheap it's free it's infinitely portable and all you need is is three different sets of instructions of up regulating down regulating transcending your current consciousness because you want to get someplace else very very easy and back to the idea of the pendulum it has a cascade of effects it's not just our breathing it's even not just our the gas exchange in our bloodstream it's actually you know cascades to our vagal nerve cascades to other elements what a hacks that if we're in a conversational we're in a situation that feels overwhelming how do we reset yeah so so yeah if you find yourself in an attempt to have a coherent conversation meaning we're trying to do something that none of us know what's gonna come of this but if we play it right something better than anyone of us separately could have thought of let's say that's the kind of a version of the game we're playing and things start to go sideways right somebody gets hijacked somebody starts engaging an older less functional pattern you feel triggered you want to react you know that's what we're that right there the first moment is you know this this is man's search for meaning right it's that it's the stimulus in the response and the space between what's happening and my reaction to it therein lies freedom and redemption so a couple of things and this is you know granny wisdom 101 which is if you're about to get angry or say something off the cuff take a deep breath it actually takes several deep breaths and specifically engage in you know what freedivers called vagal tone breathing which is just the idea of act like a ten-second exhale with a two-second hold so exhale fully empty your lungs once your lungs are completely empty hold them for two seconds and then just fill your lungs and you can do that at a table you don't need to announce it you can just actually use that and just take five of those and you will match it in fact if you do it a friend of ours as a neuroscientist at Stanford his name's Andrew Huberman and he's done a fascinating research where if you combine I games so if you kind of go soft focus meaning that you're focusing your eyes to the outside of your frame and you do that vagal nerve breathing so the super slow exhales a whole you know and you do it through your nose you completely draw your physiological threat response you just chill the out super fast and so that would be the simplest and people might think you've just kind of spaced out or you're not there but yeah if you can just go soft soft I focus so you're not laser focused and you're not focused on something immediately in front of you and you do nitrogen basically nasal exhales then that will really calm you down further the next would be and part of the reason for the nose breathing the Carolyn's the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has done some fascinating research on the nitric oxide and that correlates with some research at Harvard that basically said nitric oxide is a neurotransmitter and it's a gaseous molecule and it takes stress response stuff out of our brain it shunts it all the way and it brings in feelings of you know bliss if you call it the Bliss molecule right so basically anything you can do in your body to increase nitric oxide is usually a good thing for stress response and resilience alright so that was the Harvard research then the Karolinska Institute has found that nasal breathing increases it three to five times and that if you really want to get freaky vibrating your nasal cavity as you breathe out through your nose so hmm something like that or if you were playing a didgeridoo or playing a clarinet or a trombone that I actually increases nitric oxide production 15 times so if you slam all these together you're like okay I'm gonna breathe I'm gonna exhale slowly through my nose with visual focus to the periphery and I might depending on my social situation of my comfort level even hum as I do it that is actually gonna calm me down and give me a reset so that's a true straight up kind of biohack I don't need to think anything to do it just do it and it will have some positive effect the next is now a bridge what's the bridge between the neurophysiology and psychology right so Lisa Feldman Barrett who just recently wrote a book called how emotions are main has kind of upended the field of sort of neuroscience and causation unlike what our Russians John Gottman and some others have you people have probably heard these stories of like the smile muscles and all the micro muscles around the face in the eyes and different combinations and different micro muscles equals certain emotions and her pushback was actually like hey a lot of that's more culturally constructed than you think if you go to Asia what is a smile what's a slight upturn that can be cynicism that could be suck that could be actually absolute joy but that's just the most we actually display of it there's a whole host of cultural layers of how we're taught to emote starting with mirror neurons babies and mothers so her point is actually emotions are way more plastic fungible context-dependent than we might have thought there's really only four things we feel we feel positive or negative not surprise active or passive so if I was negative passive that might be depression if I was negative active that might be anger if I was active positive that might be joy if I was active if I thought it was positive passive that might be contentment so that's the jam there's just four ways we tend to feel and she calls it interior Inception meaning that before I even have an emotion which we usually we usually think of in terms of our psychology like I am happy I am sad even intransitive though I equals made that emotion she's saying it's happening at the level of our organs of our nervous system literally at the level of our bodies and brains know just they're just in those states and so one of the things that research has also found is that when you have that interior receptive response you can actually overwrite it so you're actually at that moment of choice I'm having one of those four feelings now out of my memory bank of words that represent emotions which one do I pull off the shelf and say I am sad I am happy I'm excited I'm nervous and what they have found is that you can actually overwrite and nudge by the word you choose to pick so sort of DIY neuro linguistic programming so if you're about to get on you know up on the diving blocks for a swimming race anyway my god oh my god I'm shaking right I'm feeling something I'm having an interior septic response I'm actually still at a moment of choice and if you if you lay in you prime yourself by saying I am excited right and you actually repeat that several times you will actually move into positive active instead of negative active if you say I am nervous I'm scared that then you will reinforce those things so we have a chance which is when like a no just even just awareness there's this thing called interior section and it precedes our emotions and we're actually some and more at choice on the emotions we feel than we might have thought and that by choosing positive you know neuro-linguistic priming for ourselves we can help shift that so if we're not conversation with people and something's off some things something doesn't quite a few it like first notice the sensation this is the possum ax Insight Meditation what I want notice the sensation don't rush to judge it don't rush to fix it but now once I've got a bead on it and I haven't just jumped into a reactive trauma primed response to that other person I can notice it I can overwrite it with a more positive effect if I choose to or I can even with a little bit of practice learn to speak into it hey I'm noticing I felt my energy really drop in that last 10 minutes or I'm noticing I feel agitated I'm noticing these things so there's there's levels of I'm having a response and I want to just address it the down-regulation the breathing the nose breathing the high gates there's I'm having a somewhat neutral interior receptive response and I can nip it in the bud before I've named it as a destructive or a reactive emotion and I can prime it and override it and then even higher level of Judo would be I'm not trying to fix it change it shape it at all I'm simply gonna notice it and name it and with a little bit of practice I can speak that truth into the shared conversation and quite often you'll find out did you I need the whole thinking job to the level where oh me too or oh thank you for saying that and then we're back to that level of resonance and coherence not from follow me I'm super stoked this is all amazing and I'm gonna be this bright light it's more like actually let's actually orient around what is happening right now now what are the truths we can explore if we can stay in this place together without judgment without naming the emotion without then creating the narrative without enacting triggered drama responses around it and that actually is arguably an even more magic place for us to get together to forge coherence which is wherever the hell we actually are versus some effort to escape it fix it mend it transcendence [Music] you
