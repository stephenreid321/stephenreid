a lot of people have a sense that a felt sense that things are starting to break down do you sympathize with that and how would you sort of sum up what that means if we look at the history of the thing we call civilization to date one very obvious thing that we notice is that all the early civilizations don't still exist whether we look at the Mayas the Aztecs the Egyptians the Roman Empire the Greek Empire the they all collapsed and so the precedent is actually that civilization collapses not that it maintains the real difference is that this is the first time we have a completely global civilization there really is no such thing as USA or China separate from each other when you understand globalized materials economies technology economics where there's actually no country in the world that can make its own consumer electronics right without the mining and manufacturing and you know technology that happens from around the world so our process of civilization is one that has inherently self terminating dynamics built into it when that happens at a fully global scale it is a basically the catastrophe is just unbounded where it has always been bounded as big as the Roman Empire was when it fell it wasn't everything and limited by not only its total geographical size but the level of Technology it had it caused desertification throughout the noble agriculture but it wasn't able to destabilize the biosphere writ large in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we've removed most of the large fish species from a water planet right at 3/4 water planet took three and a half billion years to get those fish species and so you recognize that we're operating the same way that has always led to war and environmental destruction and collapse of civilization just factoring exponential technology and so when you start to think about exponential rivalry rivalry dynamics that lead to polarization that ends up leading to war but now exponential warfare it becomes larger than a finite biosphere can handle and it becomes existential when you think about exponential extraction the next one pollution which means depletion and accumulation from open loops in a network diagram you go to an eco system there are no open loops every thing is the food for something else there is no unknowable resource no waste our civilization is characterized by materials economy that's linear not circular so toxicity is depletion on one side accumulation on the other whether we're talking about on the depletion side whether we're talking about species extinction or biodiversity loss or any of the issues that we look at there and on the accumulation side whether we're talking about co2 levels in the air or in the water or nitrogen runoff or degraded uranium or whatever else it is those are all specific instantiations of open loops in the way we do civilization in relationship to the closed loop dynamics of the ecosystem that both have a civilization that is increasingly fragile and that is making increasingly fragile underlying ecosystem is basically debasing the substrate upon which it depends and so when you think about exponential extraction exponential pollution that obviously gets larger than the playing field can handle when you try and think about exponential expansion of the monetary supply that has to be based in goods and services that can't keep happening when you think about we compete using narrative and information when you start to think about exponential information tech used for disinformation and for population control you get to a place where the information ecology is so broken that what's actually happening with North Korea or not are we going to have nuclear war what's actually happening with Syria what's actually happening with Putin's relationship to the Trump administration how long do we really have before all the coral die-off like all the most important questions as to whether we make it or not as a species nobody really knows how to make sense of and so when you have a situation where you've actually got an exponentially decreasing sense-making capacity right an information ecology that is increasingly more broken with an exponentially increasing capacity to make big choices right technology is basically a lever of our choice making so a fist has one level of harm and I extend that to a stone tool it's a bigger harm to a bronze tool to a gun at the level of an ICBM that's just a really big extension of that type choice-making capacity but when I have exponentially increased choice-making capacity with exponentially worse sense making that always runs into a cliff and so the underlying dynamics that are leading to the self-determination that people feel and sense right now are not different in kind than the ones that we've been facing since the beginning of what we call civilization they're different in magnitude and in the speed of process factoring the exponential curves involved and what is it because some people talk about the shift being we can talk about intermit irreal terms or we can talk about it in terms of an evolution in consciousness or the way that we operate what do you sense is that leap that we need to make in terms of how we operate you actually have to think about it on all of those levels to be able to make sense of it in a meaningful way otherwise it's kind of like asking when we are talking about the health of a person whether that means the health of their liver or their kidneys or their blood it's like that doesn't even make sense you can't separate those things from each other so when I think about what economics is economics is our value system codified as value equations that determines how much we value one thing relative to another thing that determines what we're incentivized to do and what we confer power to so if a dead whale is worth a million dollars on a fishing boat and a live whale in the ocean is worth nothing that's a value system codified in a value equation that then incentivizes behavior but it also incentivizes psychopathology right psychopathy actually I have to shut empathy down because leaving the whale in the ocean it I hope she isn't even gonna stay in the ocean another guy's gonna hunt it out right so I've got a tragedy of the Commons so I have to kind of deaden to be able to do the thing that is incentivized by the system or somebody else does and I'm just not effective in the system so you can't think about the evolution of human consciousness and the evolution of economics differently but if you look at the way economics then needs to protect its own profit stream in the way it will learn how to influence media to control people's sense making frameworks in the way it will influence governance again this is getting to consciousness or the way it will influence legislation on the nature of what happens in education to prepare people for the work force and so the paradigm shift is basically everything we need new systems of governance if we just I mean we think about how much we love the word democracy and we love the word democracy because it's better than tyranny and it's better than the other like really horrible systems that we've experienced at any scale but when Winston Churchill said democracy is the single worst form of governance ever created save for all the other forms what he was saying that was really insightful was that getting lots of humans to agree on anything is just a hard thing to do and we suck at it and we've never actually done a good job at it and this is a really flawed system now we like it because like we said it's overcoming things that were even more problematic if you think about democracy for a moment and whether we're talking representative democracy or liquid democracy using a voting currency or binary vote fundamentally of a process of saying okay we can't get everybody to agree beyond a very small number of people Dunbar number tribe you can get everybody degree because they can all be in a conversation together beyond the level of which you can have a conversation together you can have a few people control everything and they can be in a conversation together some type of oligarchy or meritocracy but then you're like no we want most of the people to agree at least right that seems like a good idea but somebody puts forward a proposition to do something that they think is important based on their limited sense making that is never everything that proposition because it wasn't informed by comprehensive sense making will always in the process of benefiting something also damage something else and so some people love it based on if what it's benefiting is directly relevant to them and other people hate it based on if what it's damaging is relevant to them you just created inexorable polarization because you made shitty propositions and then ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri on a shitty proposition so you notice people actually don't all get to contribute to the sense making of what a good proposition would be there's no kind of collective input there there isn't even a generation of what would good mean here and they so really even their choice making is just yes or no on a frame that was already controlled and typically who's going to be able to even put forward a proposition as someone who has vested interests and so you're stuck with polarization in that particular system right so we need new systems of governance that are not any system of governance the world has ever done so far there are systems of how do we individually and collectively make sense of what's going on make sense of what we actually value and how those values can be synergistically satisfied rather than an a theory of trade-offs with each other progressively better and how do we create design that are optimal synergistic satisfiers so that's totally new thing governance wise we need totally new systems of economics we need totally new systems of Education healthcare all the way down to at an individual level a new basis for identity values our own individual sense making choice making as long as I think that I'm an individual that is fundamentally separate from you and the biosphere and everything else I can think about optimizing my own quality of life independent of and maybe even at the expense of your quality of life for the biosphere or anything else as soon as I get that I start to say okay well I'm not that tree but what would I be without trees why would not exist right well there would be no atmosphere if they weren't plants photosynthesizing so I fundamentally am not even a meaningful concept without plants so if I think of myself as me that is not fundamentally interdependent with plants I'm actually just not even thinking clearly right it's just a bad ontology it's a bad semiotic s-- and then I start to run that and say well what about soil microbiota and what about and it turns out that my life depends on the whole thing right so I am really I can be better thought of as an emergent property of this whole thing right not just a biosphere because what would it be without the Sun and so as long as I have a sense of AI that is separate and maybe even rival ris'n rival risk competition for some scarce status resource attention partner or whatever it is then we have a fundamental basis for war and in a world of exponentially increasing technology which means that the warfare gets to be more and more consequential that will self terminate so rival risk dynamics multiplied by exponential tech self-terminate exponential tech is inexorable we cannot put it away so we either figure out anti rivalry or we go exceed you an experiment comes to a completion that's like that's the core thing figuring out anti rivalry is a psycho-spiritual process inside of ourselves can we actually even get along with our family members can we pay attention to our emotions and triggers that hijack us from sovereignty because the moment I'm getting pissed in my value system is not to be an angry person I'm actually hijacked right can I pay attention to that and actually have some sovereignty over my own inner state and how I show up in the world and can we figure out how to do that collectively as well but that was my question how do we give people a sense of that connection beyond themselves to give them a felt sense of their connection to that to the natural world and to what they depend on so an important thing to understand about Homo sapiens that is different than all the other species as far as we know is you look at a horse and it's up and walking in 20 minutes and it takes a human a year to walk and you think about how we can be helpless for that long evolutionarily right like think about how many 20 minute segments go into a year to think about how many multiples of helplessness that is and even a gorilla or a chimpanzee can hold on to its mom's fur in the first few minutes and we can't move our head for three months we're like okay we are born super in the autumn this or fetal for a very long time and the reason is because all the other animals evolved to fit an environmental niche we are niche creators who went to the Arctic who went out to the islands who went to the desert who we were able to create niche adaptation everywhere and then we made new niches like cities right and so we couldn't come with a hardwired program for how to be adaptive to a certain environment we had to come not hardwired learn what the environment was because it used to be super valuable to throw Spears now we don't throw Spears that mantri text into other things so we have to actually be able to soft wire that means that we are radically more affected by our environment than all the other creatures are - and not just in childhood but even into adulthood and with neuroplasticity we are continuously being affected by our environment so when you think about that our whole evolutionary history was in ecosystems that we depended upon where we were being well the complexity of nature the self-organizing dynamics of nature was what our nervous system was taking in and getting an intuition for and then we grow up not connected to any complex system nature to a little bit of manicured nature that's about it and all man-made structures that are complicated not complex they're all fragile you bring this house down it doesn't repair itself you burn a forest down it does you damage this camera it doesn't repair itself you cut me I'll repair myself so we don't even have an intuition for what nature is or what complexity is or what self-organization is because we haven't spending time around it and we are that conditioned by what we're around now younger generations are growing up with almost their entire life from their earliest neuroplasticity is two-dimensional right and that it responds to them in a way that doesn't have physics it has some other pre-programmed in physics so there isn't even an intuition for how physics works so all of that is a preface to say reconditioning a felt sense of our connectedness with everything is not actually a trivial thing to do it's a it's a deep process and there's a cognitive development that people can start with which actually matters which is as soon as you just really think about it and think about who am i without plants and Who am I without pollinators and you realize I don't exist and you start to get that the that there is this kind of narcissism that we're stuck in almost all the time thinking about me I and it's not even it's not even a good thought it's like it's not even a rational way to optimize my own life let alone the fact that it creates depression just thinking cognitively about the interconnectivity of everything actually helps a lot how to get a more embodied sense go spend time in nature do psychedelics do any kind of state practice that creates expanded States see how you can have more intimate relationships with more people all those things and when you sketch it out like that it seems immense the challenge are you are you hopeful or are you pessimistic I think that the shift that we are on the precipice of is not like the shift from the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment or even the Agricultural Revolution it's like more like a shift from single cell to multicellular life it's like a really deep fundamental shift in the level and type of complexity in the nature of reality that we're talking about evolution brought about rival risk dynamics but then it also brought about our prefrontal cortices our capacity for abstraction and our ability to do design and technology Lions can't make themselves radically more capable as a predator in a very short period of time faster than the gazelles can get away right if they could they could eat all the gazelles and then go extinct because they debase the substrate upon which they lived and so as the great whites getting a little bit faster the seals are also getting faster right the whole system is Co evolving so there are no radical power asymmetries we start modeling ourself as an apex predator but then developing tools that increased our ability to do that on an exponential curve when the environment wasn't increasing its capacity to deal with that on an exponential curve that self terminates so that's evolution modified by technology we need something that is neither of those things to be able to take the next step and you know one way of talking about it is evolution is an unconscious process rights an algorithmic process of which species survive and reproduce and it's extremely slow and most things fail what makes it through though has a profound degree of complexity design is a much faster process but we always build things that optimize for some number of functions that we intended to talk to minus four but they affect more things than we intended to optimize which usually is an externality there's some you know harm or wasn't intended evolution by design is something that is different than just technology design where we're designing complicated systems and it's different than complex design that is unconscious there's a process by which we can think of it mythopoetic terms and say the evolutionary process kept increasing orderly complexity until we got to the capacity for abstraction that could contemplate evolution itself and look at the principles of evolution see what it's doing and choose to consciously participate within mediate evolution itself and so then we get to move from we have the possibility of moving from being parts of the whole that are competing with each other but moving to having power that makes that no longer possible to actually being agents for the whole because we can't model ourselves as apex predators when we have the ability to extinct whole species rule and whole biospheres make new species like that's no longer an adequate model the only thing in nature that has the kind of ubiquitous power that can make species and destroy species and change the geography is nature itself but now consciously mediated through agents that have kind of woken up as that so I think this I think this next shift is us realizing that as technology it results from the our abstraction but focused on parts and not focused on how the whole thing fits together as technology is kind of giving us the power of gods we have to get the love and wisdom and understanding of gods or we self-terminate with that power that's a big task I don't think that we can say that anything smaller than that could possibly be adequate you didn't say whether you think we were likely to make it on up I think that if you were to let's take the standard narrative on evolutionary history and we say okay there is no life in universe till started on earth three billion years ago so you've got billions of years right ten plus billion years where there's no life and a lot of happened right there was a lot of physics and chemistry and cosmology happening you could say based on that it's probably that there's never gonna be this thing called life because forecasting from the current curve it would seem like we've run all the combinatorics right and then life emerges and then there's about a billion years where there's just single cells and it seems like a billion years is a really long time to figure stuff out they're not gonna be multi cells it's actually when the single-cell creatures are at a phase shift of near self-induced extinction that leads to the environmental pressures that lead to multi cells and you know one narrative of how that happened so it's kind of the nature of universe to do unprecedented stuff right that is kind of what evolution means is that new epochs are unprecedented saying we need a miracle but we have miracles in the post I'm saying we need an epoch shift it is not the continuation of the current curve that is a discrete nonlinear phase shift and that if we think about it as just continuation of current curves okay these things are getting better with tech let's just hope they keep getting better it doesn't work and so but if we say what are the necessary and sufficient criteria of a civilization that doesn't self germinate in the presence of the emerging power we can actually identify what those criteria are and they're actually things that we can do then that becomes the only mo that makes sentences working to bring that about but then looking at the current political climate looking at the current kind of the leaders that we have at the moment do you have any hope that they are going to be equipped to bring this about of course not because the they are part of the system that is obsoleting itself do you have a sense of how that shifts then if they can't do it I'll say things that everyone has probably heard when Bucky fuller famously said don't try to fight the existing system or fix it just build a new one that obsoletes it that it has the right characteristics it's very much that when we think about the the kind of caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis inside the chrysalis it's not a caterpillar or a butterfly it's goo right and that goo phase that liminal phase the caterpillar is actually dying right because the caterpillar doesn't just lose weight and grow wings if you look at it the the caterpillar has a genetic code to go gather parts right to gather minerals and amino acids and sugars that are going to then be reassembled into a butterfly if the if we were just looking at the caterpillar and we didn't know it's gonna butterfly and we were looking at its getting bigger and it's eating everything it's not pollinating anything we would predict that it eats itself into extinction except at a certain point it gets rich enough blood chemistry that it triggers this movement into the chrysalis it starts to dissolve it gets reorganized at a you know amino acid level into something that now pollinates the plants that the caterpillar decimated across these vast spaces and helps the evolution of the whole system the butterfly phase could not have been predicted from the caterpillar phase and the so if we look at capitalism in the military industrial complex and all those systems as gathering parts right very much like the caterpillar was net consumption very much like a fetuses in utero the fetus couldn't go past 40 weeks 50 60 it dies and the mom dies but it also couldn't come out much earlier because it wasn't ready to make a phase shift it comes out when it first can it has finally evolved to the place that it can actually do breast milk rather than get food from the umbilical cord directly but it also comes out when it has to there's a fairly narrow window of transition the same is true for an animal developing inside of an eggshell or a there's a finite amount of resources and when it runs out it has to emerge but that's also the first time that it can emerge that system can handle the transition so we see in nature this kind of precedent that these discrete nonlinear phase shifts because there's a curve of in utero and then there's a shift and then there's a curve outside but that discrete phase shift have come through the birth canal is different than either the phase before after so when you're asking like or any of the caterpillar is going to be able to do the pollination thing it's the wrong question right like the the problem that we see is the caterpillars are eating everything that's true and and that is to gather the resources that get assembled in a fun for a fundamentally different set of reasons it's if we say how do we maintain strategic competitive that's what the leaders are trying to do leader of a companies trying to maintain strategic competitive advantages grants the other companies a country is across other countries but of course the moment you have some sorts of asymmetric advantage and you deploy at everybody sees it reverse engineers it makes modifications on it and you just up the level of rivalry for the entire playing field that itself is what is terminating the seeking of strategic competitive advantage the the rival risk dynamics because that is what actually self terminates with this level of power so it's how do we take all the technological capacity and start to use it for something that is not trying to have power over but to have strength to not be deformed by other power and be able to be anti rivalries and etc so if there's a society we're going from this sort of idea of the caterpillar to the butterfly does that mean each individual person has to go through that same shift and if so what does that mean well how does that look individually yes as families and small groups of people yes as communities villages tribes larger groups of people yes all the way up to everybody so individual and collective sense making in choice making process an individual is necessary but it's not sufficient if you have a bunch of people that are making sense on their own they can never make sense of the complexity of the whole world if they don't figure out how to have meaningful collaborative dynamics to other people and if they have collaborative dynamics with some but then not others and they get into a competitive dynamic than the others figure out how to disinfect so we either figure out anti rivalries Omni collaborative type dynamics or we cap out at a level of collective intelligence less than we need so as individuals saying okay on my own I don't know how to change macroeconomics I don't know how to create whatever the post democracy governance system is I don't know how to make a closed-loop materials economy what can I do to it least be starting to become a citizen of the future world myself one thing I'd say is stop trying to win at the dying game and not just the dying game but the game that's killing everything if you're still trying to win at that game like you can't also claim to take seriously anything meaningful that's one thing and then also don't just get stuck in being angry or hopeless or just your own personal development and go off to a Lotus Eater thing like actually be dedicated to progressively better figuring out what you can do to make a new game it works for everybody it sounds like there's a kind of almost spiritual dynamic to it in terms of getting past one's own ego if you can't get along with your family members and your ex-partners and you're pretty sure that you're right about things and they're wrong about things and you think you have any idea of how Israel and Palestine can get along or how the US and China can get along you are just silly and so you really don't get to even have a idea about politics if you don't actually know something in an embodied sense around how to deal with differences and how to yeah how did how to do real conflict resolution so it sounds a bit Jordan Peterson clean your room pay attention to what you can pay attention to before you try and fix anything else foundations or foundations those are important so the other critical thing is that you can't assume that other people are going to fix these issues and you can just kind of chill in the world will work out that also doesn't mean that you should freak out and go into it existential angst on hyperdrive without knowing what to do but to progressively lean in more and say okay there's a path or we can make it but it's not a given at all that we do yet rather than ask whether we do or not how do I help determine that we do how can I engage and that will require learning a bunch of that you don't currently know and that maybe nobody has synthesized well yet and that's what being in imaginal in the transition from caterpillar to butterfly really means is taking some empowered responsibility for being someone who's recognizing that you can't just run the instruction manual that was given historically and the new instruction manual doesn't exist yet and it's actually the time of people in that liminal phase is to work on developing what is what are the new structures what does that look like for an individual to learn like if they say if someone watching this would say okay right I need to learn stuff what are those things that we need to learn well some people might have a very clear sense of in the picture of all that needs done working on the future of Education and how to facilitate the development of young humans to be healthy sovereign humans is really their focus and there's certain things are going to focus on for that or health care or the new materials economy or whatever it is if one is wanting to become comprehensively more educated about civilization changes needed writ large pay attention to the people in this video that you resonate with and go find more of their
