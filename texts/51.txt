hey guys this is a very quick video to let you know a couple of really interesting things that are coming up we've got an interview with Ken Wilber the integral philosopher coming up next week which we're really excited about and also a live event and an interview within McGilchrist the author of the master in his emissary so the reason for this is to ask for some questions from the community before we do both of these interviews and we're going to give priority to patrons but if you've got a question for either of them put it below in the comments to this and yeah Ally's gonna talk a little bit more about the live event we've got coming up next week yeah so as well as recording an interview with Ian McGilchrist we're also gonna have a live event part of our new series rebel wisdom live so we're going to be hopefully live-streaming it I also wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to everyone who stuck with us in our experimental first run with the war on art which was an event with Tim Loughton Lionel Shriver which we'll also be putting up soon we're just working on some sound issues that some of the people who were watching the live stream might have noticed so the event happening next Tuesday is with Ian McGilchrist it's called divided brain divided world it's at 7 o'clock at 91 which is in Brick Lane in London so if you're in London come along it's only about 10 tickets left so I would book fairly soon if you're interested and again we're gonna be hopefully live-streaming it so if seven o'clock GMT you can google that whatever it is in your local timezone will will hopefully be live as well so you can watch it and in addition to the live event we've also got an interview with a McGilchrist that we're going to do next Tuesday and just to kind of recap who in McGilchrist is and he wrote a book called the master in his emissary he did a very well-received interview with Jordan Peterson and I think February this year and the main theory of the master Owens emissary is that there are the the different hemispheres of the brain have different functions left hemisphere much more analytical much more mechanical much more atomistic and the right brain being much more holistic and not a lot of the different ways that we perceive the world and the conflict between the different ways we perceive the world can be seen as a conflict between the right brain and the left brain so we're really interested to crowdsource questions for ear McGilchrist we so put some questions in the comments below below this video and as always we're gonna priority to patrons but if you ask a good question there's every chance that we're gonna ask it to him and as well as a McGilchrist next week about two days later we're flying to Boulder Colorado to interview Ken Wilber which we're both really excited about being fans of his integral philosophy and we know there's lots of fans on the channel as well so if you have questions for Ken Wilber that you would like us to ask we obviously can't guarantee every question will go in put your questions in the comments and you can also ask them through patreon and with both Emma Gilchrist and Ken Wilber we'll be doing some patreon only specials and exclusive content as well so thank you for watching see you soon
