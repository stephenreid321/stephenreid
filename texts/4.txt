[Music] Rule Omega is actually a really simple practical thing that I towards coherence that I would like everybody here to get is if if Jordan mare talking or Pugh and I are talking like we we have this and I think we naturally have it's worth making explicit is if you say something that sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy or wrong I actually give the benefit of the doubt that you might have a reason that I didn't understand first so rather than just default into you're probably wrong I'll ask more questions and and that giving the benefit of the doubt that you actually might have something useful to say increases my making sure that I understand you before I'm responding and that actually and the disagreeing was something that you weren't even saying because I didn't seek to understand well enough creates very turbulent flow rather than laminar flow breaks down coherence right if people could just do that towards coherence if they could just give the benefit of the doubt that each other that everyone has some signal even if it's on a very different part of reality than the part they're focused on and even if there's noise involved and they're listening for the signal first that would change everything that's a starting place so Daniel expresses something and let's see he's trying to express intense hard which by the way the rule make is designed for that kind of a thing like I'm not interested in having conversations that aren't actually trying to break new ground so okay do with you so you expressing something hard and in the expression ninety-eight percent is noise and two percent is signal like the chance riff but what happens is that my job is to actually do two things one hold all of it not just say it that was that wasn't a hundred percent right so I'm just gonna nuke it hold all of it then in my self discernment to what degree can i express something back that gets rid of the fifty fifty percent that is noise so now I've got 6% signal express it back and of course if he can then do that and now you three is even better a more profound instrument because you're gonna be bringing a different perspective perhaps you can take it and actually zoom in on it down to the poem you're actually 50% signal that's the idea I and so one it's an invitation and say hey we're trying to do something's hard let's all try to do something that's hard to be willing to take the risk of not speaking elegantly and on the premise that everyone else is doing their absolute level best to hear that which is trying to speak itself through you and listening them is in themselves like oh there it is tone got it there's something beautiful and clear there here's what I heard and that's for the Omega and there's a psychological safety that's created to be able to try out new stuff knowing that we know we're trying out new stuff we're giving the benefit of the doubt so it actually does become more explorative and that's where you get more novelty and then I imagine I don't know if this is true for Daniel I imagine it's true for you but certainly if it's true for me is that I'm also noticing myself like this constant you know when you're meditating you feel this this constant chatter and flow of like all the things that are going on internally that are either like certain ideas are popping up or emotional responses some of them are like social emotional responses some of them are like just like I got a P and like being able to actually notice all that chatter internally and do the disturbing interior and say okay of all that chatter which have a heart that's actually signal oh but listen to all of it you have to have you we're gonna make it goes in and out right I'm listening to myself fully and I'm listening to the to the others fully and trying to use discernment to continuously allow that process to turn that into gold now there's a really important distinction that we're saying something that is different than the way that some people think about multi perspectivism which is we're not saying I'm not saying all perspectives are equally valid and I'm also not saying that there is no way to integrate them into higher understanding I'm saying all perspectives have some signal generally have some noise and that perspective is itself a reduction of information on the reality being perceived don't know it's on the quantum foam of it all [Music] you [Music]
