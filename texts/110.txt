[Music] especially in the the interview was Camille Paglia I think you said that you fear that the that men checking out could be a fatal situation for Western culture gods definitely fatal for Western culture one of the things that struck me over the last year all even last night at the lecture at last night's lecture 85% of the people were men now in the twelve part series that preceded that more and more women came and then there was this gap but like the vast majority of the audience was men and men of all sorts like it wasn't you're like every sort of man was represented there young old rough civilized the whole range you know and there and they're coming from quite a long distance many of them you know they come up and say why I drove from New York City or I drove from Michigan it's like well you could watch it on YouTube it's like no they're not doing that and that's very promising to me because well this logos that the West will die without the rebirth of the logos because the West is that so without gone it's gone and we've seen what's arisen to replace it while there's fascism there's communism and then there's the New Age mess because it's a mess and most of its wish fulfillment and fantasy and inability to there's creativity in it but there's no capacity to edit whatsoever there's no coherence and so that's stuff so weak that anyone with any commitment can just push it aside and there's no justification for the for the Marxism and or for the fascism it's like we already had that experiment could you describe what you mean by the rebirth of the logos then in that context well it's it's the it's part of it is taking taking voluntary responsibility for the appalling conditions of your life essentially that you're a suffering creature that's mortal right and that you're the locus of evil both of the those things and that it's your response that your life is about responsibility and it's your responsibility to voluntarily accept that and then to do what you can about it even though it's in some sense you know it's an enterprise doomed to failure in some sense because you're going to die and and and the world is a carnage a place of carnage but that that you can accept that and if you can't accept it then what that means is that you're not integrated enough because if your integrated enough then you can accept it it's it's like the test of the integration so your your character isn't forged sufficiently if you cannot tolerate that and it's not like it's an easy thing to tolerate often what people do is they just don't think about it they just push it out of their mind and no wonder but they pay for that with shallowness and with self contempt and with with the inability to bear suffering nobly let's say and that's there's nothing in that that's good for people so the rebirth of the logos as far as I'm concerned is well it's this willingness to take responsibility to for the shaping of destiny that's it I mean the old Mesopotamian God Marduk when he became the pinnacle God by election basically one of his demands from the other gods was that he be in control of the tablet of destiny right and so there's an the old idea among the Mesopotamians was that the highest God was he who was in control of destiny it's like well to the degree that you align yourself properly then you take responsibility for destiny and that's that's a concentric set of circles with no end you know because you can straighten up yourself and then you can straighten up your family and if you do that property you're simultaneously strengthening community and and and and then you're a model for your peers and so that starts to spread and we don't have any idea what we would be like if we all got our acts together like we're pretty amazing as it is human beings and you know we're probably devoting who knows what it is in terms of percentage I mean the doubt a Ching suggests you know that thirty percent thirty percent of people are working to make things better and thirty percent of people are neutral and thirty percent are trying to make things worse so it's obviously a metaphor but but there's some truth in it we don't know what it would be like what we would be like if we put our effort to making things better devoted our effort to making things better wherever we went and it would be interesting to find out how would you summarize why men are in crisis no I think it's because in a deep level the West has lost faith in the idea of masculinity now that's no different than the death of God it's the same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be I mean that's most of what he wrote about you know and so you'd say well the divine symbol of masculinity has been obliterated well so then what do you expect what it what's gonna happen it's gonna that means masculinity is going to become weak and especially if the symbol is also denigrated right which it definitely is so what that means is that the ideal that man could aspire to is denigrated and well then with your ideal in tatters you're weak that's that's definitional so I think the reason that men have been responding positively to my my thinking let's say is that I don't buy any of that I like the masculine spirit it's necessary and it's not fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's not fundamentally rape culture you know it not fundamentally world destroying and all of those things have been all of those aspersions have been cast upon it that's partly the guilt of Western society for technological progress even and those are reasonable challenges to be set before men but they're not reasonable accusations to swallow without criticism and and it's not that what is it what what is the masculinity we can aspire to well it's a responsibility fundamentally and it's it's it's to put it symbolically is that your your responsibility is to incarnate the Spirit of the logos that's your responsibility that's your role in life and that is independent to some degree in whether or not you accept the idea of a transcendent and eternal reality now I'm not making a case for that or against that I those things are beyond human understanding but we know what happens if people act poorly if men act badly we know what happens we know that the world turns into something that's so close to hell that the difference is trivial we know that that's the story of the 20th century so we should learn that lesson and what that lesson is is pick up the world on your shoulders and walk forward pick up the world with all of its trouble with all of its suffering with all of its evil and move forward with it and in bearing that burden learn that you're the sort of creature that can bear that burden and therefore deserving of respect that's that's the that's identification with the logos and that's I don't I've never encountered an idea that's better than that because it's not it's so not naive it's the opposite of naive it's like there's terrible evil and there's terrible suffering it bottomless but the human spirit is capable of voluntarily taking that on as a challenge well it's worth a try yes exactly that's that's that's that's the positive meaning that's the positive meaning that's the world affirming meaning you know and that that's that self-esteem let's say you know which is very poorly characterized it's very shallowly characterized because it usually doesn't involve any sense of responsibility but you know it's obvious if you it's obvious in some ways if you look at the people that other people spontaneously respect unless they've become unbelievably cynical it's the people who adopt responsibility and deal with it competently so it's not a mystery that that would be what you could aspire to now it gets undermined if you feel that that force of responsibility is the the raping and pillaging patriarchal culture that's despoiling the natural environment and that's equivalent to a cancer well you know no I don't buy that and I've seen that you're skeptical of the idea of the description of gender as a spectrum but no I'm suspicious of the motives for for putting that idea forward and and I also think it's it's it's an imprecise definition it's not a spectrum because a spectrum is equally represented at each point in the distribution so that's wrong and it and the it's wrong in the way that you would expect it to be wrong given its ideological basis now you know there's male and female and masculine and feminine are not exactly the same thing and so and that's a reasonable claim and you could also make a case that much masculinity without an admixture of femininity is a form of excess and that too much femininity without an admixture of masculinity is an ex is an is an excess you know or is a is a is a failure it's it's it's it's an extreme but the obliteration of the distinction between male and female or masculine and feminine is a it's a psychological catastrophe not least because those are arguably the most basic cognitive axioms they're deeper than that there there are axioms on which our entire cognitive structures is predicated and yin-yang yes exactly exactly exactly well and I think that that's a consequence of our biological heritage like the reality of sex sex is very very very old it's a fundamental issue and sex is fundamentally about female and male and there's no getting around that now as I said you can distinguish masculine and feminine from that and you can speak about the psychological components of sex as well as the physiological components but the real radicals deny the physiological components it's like that's okay except when they force other people to do the same kind of denial like people are entitled to their opinion but they're not entitled to put it in the law and so that's why I was opposed to not to transgender rights or to transgender people or I mean it's that's a sideshow in in many ways I'm not trying to trivialize it but it's not like a it's not the main event its emblematic of something else otherwise no one would have cared and I just see it as fundamentally oriented towards destabilization and destruction I think my I'm just sort of complete that that question because I think it speaks to what you just said because I think some people who are who are not motivated by the same things that are motivating the sort of extreme post modernists are some help us weighted by their by their claims that gender is a spectrum because there is something in as Jung talked about the anima animus there is something about the inner masculine the inner feminine in all of us and there is a complexity there that that is more than just a sort of a straightforward masculine face binary which is where I think that we might be able to to get out of this now that's a reasonable point you know I you know one way of conceptualizing that is in in terms of let's say in terms of the archetypes well we use the Christian archetypes for for illustration so you could say well for the male generally speaking the logos is the primary image and so that would be partly associated with the word that creates order out of chaos and also with the sacrificial crucifixion and that sort of thing the voluntary acceptance of suffering but the divine mother and child is behind that because human males are actually quite maternal right we we do participate in raising children even if they're not our own like you're much more likely to be abused by a step farther I think the risk is a hundred times greater so it's not trivial but still the fact that it happens at all is is a biological miracle so human being males are very maternal for male mammals or for males period and then females are pretty masculine I mean but you can kind of see that the the difference to which the sexes differ by looking out there the difference in their in their physiological configuration you know men are bigger and stronger than women and not a tremendous amount although upper body strength there's a tremendous difference but that's approximately how different they are and that's they're more the same than they are different but the differences aren't trivial and the thing is is that differences that are small at the average can be huge at the extremes so you might say well if you took the most agreeable people say the most comparison people out of a hundred and segregated them they would all be women all of them and if you took the least agreeable people and those would often be people who have a criminal bent they would all be men and often the cultural force is driven by the extremes not by the middle and so you don't need huge differences in the average to produce relatively large differences in in in cultural manifestation that's why there are so many men in prison compared to women you know that's that's a big deal and it's not the sexism of society that does that although it might be to some degree because like male judges give female criminals lighter sentences for example then female judges give female criminals so but no one ever talks about that so so yes it's it's reasonable to note the psychological components of masculine and feminine let's say it at a psychological and symbolic level but to do that at the same time that you're denying biological reality and playing an anti patriarchal game behind the scenes and perhaps masking your Marxist anti capitalism at the same time it's contaminates all of it so badly that you can't have a reasonable discussion and so even this the transgender issue that arose in Canada is so contaminated by the underlying ideology well first of all people would have just ignored it if that wasn't the case but it's so contaminated by the underlying ideology that you can't trust the legislation not a bit so and that was my point you can have a quality but then difference is also essential within that yeah unless you want sterile uniformity which is something that only a tyrant wants I mean that's what the tyrant wants a sterile uniformity and and the sterile is not only ideon 'el sterility but actual physiological sterility no and that's no recipe for for the continuation of a culture you know and you can be cynical about that and say well you know one cultures as good as the next and no you don't have any responsibility to continue your culture but it depends on how you want to construe your life you know I mean one of the things that's so interesting about the biblical stories is that they're these ancient people had a sense of the continuity of life across generations that we really don't have and maybe that's a consequence of I don't know a too narrow individualism something like that or or maybe a - or maybe it's a present centered hedonism but they're always acting under guidance from God let's say as if the consequences of their personal actions echo down the centuries you know indefinitely which they actually do you know and so and then with regards to the issue of what so you need men and women to play the role in that and they have to play their masculine and feminine roles fundamentally even though male and female and masculine feminine are not exactly the same idea there's there's a there's no reason to not have the differentiation it should be it should be encouraged differentiation I feel like there's so much in the maps of meaning and the biblical lectures that I really want to integrate into what we're teaching because I think it's so it's essential stuff mm-hmm for orienting yourself in the world is it just seems to be great without it that's right absolutely you're you're adrift without it you have to you have to have a conscious relationship with the archetypes there's no way if you don't then you're susceptible to possession that's basically or - or to despair yeah so and no wonder well you've got to have axioms so the run yeah seems are the archetypes yes that's where they exist you see a certain axis biological structures there at least that yeah they're preexisting their pre-existing categories of perception in the Kantian sense that's a good way of thinking about it is that you know that the peer empiricist thinks that you get all your information from the outside world right but that's not true because you bring on a priori interpretive framework to the world and that's instantiated biologically but then it's also enculturated so separating the archetype from the underlying biological reality isn't easy so you have the snake you have the propensity to to perceive reptilian predators the manner in which those things are represented in the culture fill those holes essentially and so that can same as the language instinct so yeah that's right exactly it's the same thing it's the same thing like the archetypes are manifestations of the universal grammar grammar of emotion and motivation that's a good way of thinking about it now they may be more than that but because well we you know I mean life has been moving forward for 3 and 1/2 billion years and it moves forward in these pattered and manners like the dominance hierarchy for example so that's that let's call that the masculine archetype it's part of the masculine archetype in fact the onus Proclamation was that the female representation of the male so that's the animus is the dominance hierarchy it's the patriarchy so that's that that's the unconscious archetype which i think is extremely interesting given what's happened say in the women's movement because that's what's projected onto men and and it can be projected in a very negative way it doesn't have to be but it can be and so an animus possessed woman treats a man as if he's the manifestation of the tyrannical patriarchy he's a group he's that group of men yeah the group of bad men naturally he spoke really well about in connecting the logos and I found often sharing for example men 'z groups speaking my truth speaking honestly being vulnerable being open being available has been really important I don't hear you talking so much about the value of say vulnerability or the value of emotional honesty is that but as a psyche as a psychologist that must be something the well it's more just the value of honesty in general like you need to say the things that are you're trying to represent being as accurately as you can in your communication right that's part of the logos process that's the truth its truth oriented to love I think is the right formula and love is something like the desire for being to flourish rather than to be eradicated right those are the archetypal realities are you working for the flourishing of being or for its eradication and there's a credible case to be made for its eradication so but love I think is in the in the archetypal sense is the desire for being to flourish and then truth is truth is the attempt to represent your relationship with being in the most precise and accurate manner possible because well you have to adapt to reality so you can't adapt to something too whose existence you will not admit and so emotional honesty is part of that but I don't think it's more important than any of the other elements of honesty the vulnerability issue is your modeling not so much your vulnerability but you're voluntarily voluntary acceptance of that vulnerability so because to just model your vulnerability is not necessarily distinguishable from being a victim you know I'm hurt and and I'm saying that I'm hurt it's that isn't that's not that's not the whole story the whole story is well we're all hurt and some of us more than others certainly but that it's possible to come to terms with that and with God's grace let's say and maybe some help from other people to accept that and then transcend it and that's the hope the hope is that you get beyond your you're hurt because otherwise you tend to distribute it and and pay it forward and and that's not good obviously what you're asked you to to group work or to sort of some of the psychological processing stuff that has come out of say the 60s and 70s I found it very very useful that I've not heard you speak well it can go terribly wrong you know and that's part of the reason it did in some ways died out in in the 60s like it could go terribly wrong the encounter groups are often very hard on people it can easily become tyrannical and totalitarian and I've seen that happen very rapidly in in group situations but I mean group work it's part of the way that you integrate yourself into the society so it's necessary it's obvious that group work would be prone to all those potential catastrophes because those are the catastrophes of groups but it's necessary and I would say the lectures that I'm doing for example there's group work there because there's an audience right a crowd and people like the live part of it and there is a difference between speaking to people live in a group and speaking to them say through electronic means there's a there's a there's a collective spirit let's say that manifests itself in the room and that's a consequence of everyone imitating everyone else unconsciously and and so and that that's a very powerful thing and can also be provide direction because maybe if you're fortunate and things are coming together properly in the room it's the best part of the crowd that rises up and then that rises up as a kind of ideal and then that sort of possesses each individual because they can see that they're supported in their journey forward and that these things can be and they can look around and think well these other people are taking this seriously and paying attention and so there's something to take serious here seriously here and to pay attention to and so that's all good but you have to be very aware that of the pitfalls and and so you have to beat yourself with a stick so that you mean you retain the proper humility and the humility ideas are very complicated one and I think what that is in essence is that you have to remember all the time that what you don't know is more important than what you know you have to remember that as if your life depends on it because it does I mean even technically because there's so much you don't know you don't know enough like you're prone to catastrophe so you don't know enough by definition and if you know that and understand that then that can reduce the temptation to to act in a manner that would be totalitarian or tyrannical and that can facilitate the group work you know so it's risky but everything's risky and just coming back to the idea of the rebirth of the logos something's been coming up quite a lot recently as the idea of initiation and I there's a couple of organizations in the UK one called Band of Brothers which is using men's work initiation work of some description to take disadvantaged youths and to give them a sense of direction give them a sense of purpose give them a sense of dignity well part of that's part of what an initiation is for like part of it is exposure to that which terrifies you that's part of it but then in the state that that produces you're supposed to be inculcated with the cultural wisdom and that partly is direction I mean that's what older men have to provide it's even the case with elephants you know the the young elephants herd has been decimated and the old guys are gone the young guys basically go insane they're uncontrollable and obviously that's the case with human beings and so the the purpose of mature men or the responsibility of mature men is to give young men is to be models obviously but mostly models of direction yeah well you need direction you uni and you need there has to be a rationale for aiming up because that's direction you don't aim down that's just why would you aim down unless you were angry and bitter and resentful and you know full of hatred and all that you aim up and and but that has to be put forward in a way that isn't this too tight corset grandmotherly moralizing because anybody with any sense who isn't overly domesticated is just gonna reject that so you know that's the kind of morality that Nietzsche described his cowardice right he said most people's morality is cowardice it's it's they're afraid they're afraid to be bad and because they're afraid they think they're good but they're not good they're just afraid and that's not morality morality is a whole different issue and it's partly aiming up but it's also partly gathering your forces together so that you aren't interfered with well you're moving upward so because you you will be people test it do you think the central problem of Western societies that were intent on slamming off responsibility at every level any society where people are shying away from responsibility is is a society that's self crippling because the responsibility is to do the work that's necessary to revitalize and the culture to rescue it's it's fundamental axioms from the darkness to revitalize it and to have it expand and grow and if that isn't happening then anything that isn't growing dies you know that that's sort of a fundamental truth of life and so so I don't know if it's precisely the central problem of the West because it's not like there aren't people who aren't taking responsibility in the rest of the world but it's enough of a problem in the West that it threatens us and I think that's particularly felt by young men I think the reason for that in part is that there's the direction for young women in some sense is more obvious both culturally and biologically because young women are encouraged if they're attempting to manifest the logos let's say they're definitely encouraged in that there's no doubt about it and then as a backup they have the divine mother and child and so they're kind of set with men it's more this is perhaps why men have always undergone a ritual initiation because they need to be directed more in a more art in a more articulate manner in a more conscious manner they have to be inculcated with the culture in order to decide that adopting responsibility is the appropriate thing to do and they need a rationale for that because why the hell would you adopt responsibility without a rationale it's way like the default position is aimless impulsive pleasure-seeking and inertia because all you have to do to have that is do nothing and that's easy so then the question immediate question is well why not just do that and what one of the answers is because you and the world will go to hell and very rapidly and that's a pretty good answer and it's actually true now you know what that means in any eternal sense is not an easy thing to say but the proximal sense is true enough so even in action is not morally acceptable in the face of the unkempt unfinished state of being I guess that's a reasonable way of thinking about for our full-length documentary on Jordan Peterson and more great content check the rebel wisdom website where you'll also find details of some of the events we're running for men to give a direct experience of some of what Jordan Peterson is talking about [Music]
