[Music] so this is kind of a new experiment I'm going to do a three-way conversation Tim you want to introduce yourself a little bit what what do you do and what are your interests I'm a curious human being first and foremost and that has led me to write a huge number of books 35 I think now exploring the different spiritual traditions of the world really looking for their commonality where they where underneath the difference they seem to be addressing a common human experience of what could be called awakening and that then led me to write what became a international bestseller so that kind of changed my journey on Gnosticism the jesus mysteries and then choosing the lost goddess and then the last 20 years since then really has been about trying to integrate this my own experience of the world this spiritual wisdom and the modern culture of scientific understanding into one philosophical understanding and then to put that aside something which can give people the actual experience of awakening now so it's not only an idea it's an experience there's a few things that you talked about and it you've written about that are now getting a lot more attention it seems there's a kind of weave the whole idea of rebel with rebel wisdom is that we are trying to kind of understand explain and contextualize what seems to be quite a big intellectual awakening that's going on online the whole manifestation of long-form content long-form YouTube videos has led to what a lot of people are kind of recognized as a real desire for knowledge and a kind of an intellectual awakening and part of that clearly is the sort of jordan peterson phenomena the intellectual dark web phenomena and tied in to that it's a new interest in christianity new interested in Gnosticism and as well there is with Jordan Peterson's kind of reframing of the of the Christian story in Psychological turn and there's a real there's a real interest in the religious and the sacred again after a long time of the kind of new atheist types like Richard Dawkins and sam Harris of kind of they felt to me like they had a bit of a stranglehold on the culture this sort of radical scientific skepticism so how does it feel to you what do you make of that chorale I mean look I have a I had a lot of time for Richard Dawkins and people like that because I think what they were doing is they were still fighting the Enlightenment battle which everyone what I thought they've been one turned out it haven't been one so the thing which they are attacking needs attacking however the side effect of it is you've just said though is is this idea that it you can't be intellectually credible and interested in the depths of ancient wisdom or the depths of your own natures salt this is these are even to use that word is immediately you're no longer intellectually credible so I'm really really really pleased to see a renewed interest in depth and my whole hope is that we can develop I want to get it to the place where people couldn't stand up and say things which sat which which are things like look I actually think that death is not the end of this experience I'm having a psychic I don't and I want to be able to say that and not sound like a woo idiot who's just bought into a lot of superstitious myths and at but actually has got something to say for instance and I think we can move in that direction I want to see a rational the science you know in general terms came in that whole movement in hit in history to question and replace irrational religion now we want the other end of that dialectic is to replace it with rational spirituality and if what's happening now with greater nuance and depth and long-form discussions can lead to that I think that's that's the next evolutionary step so this is an interesting term for kind of rational spirituality how does that differ to an irrational spirituality what are the key differences for you well first of all I'm not against a little bit of irrationality I mean I'm I'm I I love to step out into what not knowing which is not irrational but irrational not knowing for me is the foundation of everything so the place we have to start and finish is oh my god what you know this is we're in a breathtaking mystery that we exist and the more we find out about it the more profoundly mysterious it becomes so there's that humility is the place to start I don't know like being alive now for almost 60 years I've never met anyone who knows I'm guessing that nobody knows I don't even know what it would mean to know actually what that would mean so there's this enormous breathtaking mystery and then we do our best to understand it and we need to be open to everything and diet is our greatest ally on that so that what's wrong with irrational spirituality is it doesn't have the doubt it doesn't move on it's based on a reverence for old ideas which should become established written in old books it doesn't question itself and therefore it's stuck and there and people who believe it if they don't question them they're doing it unconsciously which is why most people are doing it with something to happen to be born in what rationality does is from impression ality all it means is having a good reason so if you think it's in the Bible is a good reason then that's a good reason I don't think that's a good reason but what's really interesting as well as the idea so the Bible the books in the Bible were assembled over many centuries millennia and it sounds like a great idea so take the best wisdom that you've got and make that into a way of living your life but at some point someone says okay right we're done this is it the Bible is finished no one's ever going to come up with any other new ideas that need to be in this book and that that for me sounds peculiar but when you understand the Bible's accreted over many years it sounds like well that would there's a lot of there's got to be a lot of accumulated wisdom in there but at what point do you say right nothing more we need to know we just need to live by these rules exactly and and the whole I mean you know obviously you you're aware of the beautifully circular kind of literalist view of the Bible where it's like I know it's true because it's in the Bible how do you know it's true because the Bible says the Bible is true and you've just going boom boom boom round in a circle so and that has to be a historical you the whole collapse of the literalist view of Christianity came through Protestant Reformation leading to the study of the Bible which no one had done and then you have an historical appreciation of it and then it's no longer the revealed Word of God and then it's up for question and then you start learning the history of it and it's not great history and the people that have been involved in it are not the sort of people that you want to trust I talked before about this kind of intellectual awakening that a lot of people are kind of recognizing is this something that you've encountered do you feel that you've been stimulated by stuff you've been seeing online recently well I was stimulated by the documentary you made with Jordan Peterson I mean that that's been the most obvious example for me where there's been this phenomena happen and my entry point from was somebody sending me videos but the first one was the one you made which I thought was excellent and I saw that this was deeply questioning seeing again seeing Jordan on the news was astonishing for me half an hour with an intellectual being questioned was wow this doesn't happen I mean I can't think of a phenomena like it may be Bertrand Russell in my lifetime I mean just about in my lifetime but not since it and so Sam Harris of course and all that so there is a definite I like most people when I came to communicate my ideas for people in the know are telling me all you need to make it short snappy sound by it's simple and I'm quite out for simple as long as it's not too simple it's not simplistic it's like carbines die sets very famously or even as simple as possible but no simpler and that's a good mantra but actually turns out people who want want depth so that I'm finding people are responding to a real conversation which is what I've loved always that's why I spent my life doing so that suddenly there's a chance to have real conversation with people like yourself and there's a lot of people who are going oh yes please I think that's just really significant I mean how wide that spreads we'll see but that the John Peterson effect has been so out of the blue really I I'm gonna admire you for seeing it coming because I certainly don't see it coming yeah it's interesting we were sort of very we want to make sure that our channel is not just kind of Jordan Peterson only but it's such a useful window and lens to start looking at what's going on in the culture and obviously the expansion into the intellectual dark web and other people riding the same wave that Jordan Peterson talks about and I know that you you've written quite a lot of agnosticism in the past one of the things that got us quite a lot of pushback was in that first child release and documentary we mentioned Gnosticism and a lot of people didn't like that do you what can you explain what Gnosticism is firstly and why it's always been like this controversial thing within Christianity so Gnosticism is a general term for a whole wide range of sex in the ancient world who were very very different actually what linked them together was that their idea of Christianity was based around the experience of new gnosis which is knowing deep mystical knowing knowing of oneself and knowing of God which turns out to be the same thing so that so they're they're about knowledge whereas traditional literalist Roman Christianity which is what we're really talking about the the religion of the Roman Empire is about belief pissed as' notice and pestis so they are they are rivals in the first centuries for the soul of Christianity the version taught by the Roman Empire which has been embraced pretty much unquestioned until recently is that the Gnostics were heretics who kind of went pagan and got confused and are therefore dangerous and will lead you astray the truth in my own opinion from my own studies is the opposite that the Gnostics are the original Christians who were then literalized into a cult which became part of the Roman Empire and then destroyed everything the pagan world the Jewish world indeed as well and ancient Gnosticism and there's always been this battle in between this established religion of an empire and this rebel undercurrent which is about not priests and bishops but you knowing for yourself through a direct experience of gnosis and we we both worked on this particular line in the documentary but we kind of suggested that he he had a gnostic the jordan Peterson had a more Gnostic understanding Christianity and a lot of people really push back on that they really didn't like yeah I mean why why Jordan has got a more Gnostic appreciation of it from what I understand of him is that he's a myth mythologies that the thing which marks out the Gnostic Christians is that they are looking at the Jesus story and indeed the other stories but the Jesus story as an as a spiritual allegory which leads to gnosis it's not about a belief in an actual historical event about a real man it's that rather he is an everyman character as young of course himself was a gnostic and wrote the seven servants of the dead in the name of a gnostic teacher bazzill a des and bought the gnostic manuscripts once so which is why we have them is the that Jesus is an archetype of the self so that they were seeing the Jesus story right from the birth and the cave to the empty cave at the end as an allegory about one's own spiritual journey through stages of initiation to this awakening that's not what I was told at Sunday School and because of that mismatch that's why people are very wary of the Gnostics and something I've always found fascinating it a bit confusing talking to two Christian friends is that they often say that it is the literal physical resurrect of Jesus that is at the core of at least that form of literalist Christianity and without him the whole thing kind of falls apart why is that yeah why is that it's big there you know the strange thing is you know that only makes sense if you have a literal atom and even than a literal fall because the whole mythology is that it's a it's redemption for that fall so if you really go down the literalist road and you're willing to believe that everything was created in seven days and Adam and Eve and all the rest of it then you do need a literal Jesus but if you understand that as mythology then you can understand Jesus as mythology it's just a big jump people feel they're losing something you know if when they read my you know or come across my ideas and it's like oh you don't you think that Jesus is a myth it's like oh the the truth however is the opposite what strikes me is that everyone has their own Jesus you know you speak to a fundamentalist and Jesus is a you know fire and brimstone you talk to a nice Quaker and Jesus is a passive this you talk to Muslim and Jesus is a prophet like Muhammad but just not quite as good and the you know or eise you know everyone's got their own Jesus and he's just like them now if there was an historical Jesus most people must accept that their Jesus is not the real one and that they're they're having a relationship with a fantasy which is Trembley sad on the other hand if you understand that the figure is designed to be a representation for your own deeper self it's exactly right you should have your own Jesus I have my own Jesus Jesus is in my life it's just not it's not a literal man it's a it's a mask of God like Joseph Campbell said so it's something which you reach through just in the same way that you know I don't think most people certainly the West would see there was a literal Krishna or additional Vishnu or a middle drama that in the same way or indeed the ancient gods the Dionysus or Cyrus so do you think Jesus really existed no no I think the evidence personally really really points us three there's three prongs to that really I mean I certainly didn't set out with that I mean I when I started work on the Gnostics I I assumed there was a real Jesus that almost became a friar when I was younger you know brought up in the Church of England and very nearly joined the church but eventually with the research there seem to be three things one was the incredible similarities between ancient pagan mythology and what became with Jesus story and seeing that in that in these ancient pagan myths of a son of god or a god man were all the motifs now people attack that because there's no there's no ancient story which is the same it's not like a it's not just copied but it's more like you would get in film today or in you know if you took I don't know the matrix you could probably go look he's taken that from there and that's come from there and that's and from it's created a whole new thing that's of the Jesus time it's just taken all these motifs so that just about every single thing probably everything actually that makes up the Jesus story as a narrative is already there in the ancient world and so there's that so it resembles pagan myths there's the fact that the earliest Christians don't deny this there you can get Justin Martyr who actually it makes a virtue of it that the similarities so they're not the why it's a shock today when people realize it's the same as pagan mythology it wasn't then it was obviously so that's the one kind of part of it and then there the others are Gnostics which is here is a group of people who are predate actually the idea of year 0 because there is no USERRA so they've been around and they're studying the myths of the the earth mythology and and that as an allegory Exodus in particular they're around Alexandria where I think all of this is being written which is like the New York of the ancient world big Jewish community all speaking Greek which is the English of the ancient world and they are writing all these documents in in Greek and we have loads of them which accord into testamental texts and they're a combination of Jewish mythology and pagan mythology and then at the end of them becomes this other these other texts these Gnostic texts which I think are there all Gnostic which have this amazing story of the ridhima which are very similar to pagan myths and they themselves are a mixture of pagan and Jewish mythology and it just feels us a natural continuation and they see it as their great heresy for which they were put down is Jesus never came in the flesh he comes in you so that's the two and then the third thing is there is no evidence for historical man none nothing absolutely nothing and the only things which are held up but this little passage in the Jewish historian Josephus is I mean any any scholar with this all know the fake is that the language is wrong it's been added later it's and it shows just how they were desperate to find some something which they could hang this room so it's not important to me really whether there was or wasn't a historical Jesus then more and more interested in what the myth means but I don't think there was there was another part of that myth my understanding which integrated Sofia so kind of Divine Feminine archetype which seems very missing from Christianity otherwise so what was Sophia to the Gnostics yeah isn't that mean isn't that amazing there was a Christian goddess I mean isn't that I realized was so excited when we started getting into that and as a philosopher Philo so fear and lover of Sofia as my alright cool so she gets called but she got lots of names Sofia's just one the pagan mythology I think has taken it that comes into Christianity in that in its original Gnostic form as a quitter nity I think there is father and son mother and daughter and they represent in the mythology they the the the male archetype is is a source the mystery the unseen the that's God God is the source of potentiality for everything and the goddess is all form that the probably the easiest understanding of that is knew it in the Egyptian tradition the night sky she's the whole universe and everything within it that's the canopy and through the karakia are holes the stars where the light beyond which is the male principle shines and then she's so wearing her now she is all the forms she is soul/psyche for and and then that individuals so now there's the Sun which is that potentiality that pure being consciousness but he knew and in me so that's our end and that's the son and then the daughter is our soul it's our particular fragment of the world soul or the cosmic soul and so the job of redemption so the Noah the gnostic myth is one of the fall and so Sofia which is everyone's soul man and women falling into mater getting lost looking for love looking from the light and looking in all the wrong places becoming abused and having a very hard time lots of suffering and then turning around and crawling back to her father help me and then the male principle sends the son to rescue her and he's her brother stroke lover as you're only allowed to be in myths and comes down and and that's the Jesus figure and in the Jesus story you get the two you get the Virgin Mary at the mouth of the cave the the stable but actually it's cave and the Greek so she's at the mouth of the cave and she's the goddess of Justice who brings that she's on the left hand of the left hand path which brings souls in and out of incarnation Jesus is going to sit on the right hand which leads people away from that but she's recycling Souls and Jesus comes in and he's the perfect initiate goes through his life and then and then and then part of that is the meeting the other Mary who's the fallen woman has Sofia I mean there's taken directly from the Sofia myth and he takes out seven demons well the place where people will be most aware of those seven levels now it's the Indian chakras but actually it's also there in the in the pagan mythology and and mithra isn't particularly so he's taking her through these different levels of purification and then she what she she then becomes the what she becomes Sofia she becomes the wise woman and in in the Gnostic literature after his death it is Mary Magdalene who teaches the prett teachings to the 12 disciples because the 12 men are the the signs of the zodiac so Jesus is the still point in the middle and they dance around him literally dance and when one of the documents they dance around him and they are the twelve signs of we're on the wheel the wheel of suffering or in the in the in the pagan version it's a wheel of grief Pythagoras causes the wheel of grief it's the same as the Indian thing so we're stuck on the wheel and and she reveals the wisdom to how to find the center and so she's the dis she still by the Catholic Church is still called the disciple to the disciples so quite important and really interesting if you go back to the Gnostic literature one of the great things they're condemned for which is really interesting is that the pythagorean's release so they treat women really well and and of there's a guy called Celsus who writes about attacking the Gnostics and every gospel he mentions just about is accredited to a woman and they're great you know they have women priests and the church is very upset about the whole thing but it kind of interesting today from our point of view to look back and go oh that's much more like us why do you think this is relevant or why do you think that why is this important now I think for me they're going back with Christianity which is you know my early work 20 years ago is a bit like psych therapy it's a bit like our culturally we need to go back there's a there's a schism in the Western soul between our pagan roots and our Christian roots and we've been told that they're their enemies and they're not they're exactly the same thing Christianity is paganism there's just one evolutionary current in the West of course how could there be otherwise and that and I think there's a great healing that can happen with that and I also think the return to the Gnostic spirit which has been so prevalent since the sixties there's a return to self that the individual journey of the syph self inquiry and do you think that's become more popular because of the kind of spiritual technologies we have that the psychedelics in the internal experience of the divine that a lot of people have had have led to a revival of Gnosticism wow that's really it I mean certainly psychedelics I think did play a big role so many different currents also you know we brought in a lot of the eastern wisdom which had kept those currents alive because they hadn't gone through the same level of individuation that we did they missed that but and they're suffered for it but they benefit by keeping that other current alive so it looked very attractive to us so we could go across to to a Asia and just go oh you've got the inner mystery still and then then that's what I did most of my early books are on Eastern spirituality and then looking at the Gnostics and dynamic goddess it's right here in our Western tradition and it heals that divide so for me it's I'm more interested in where how we take it forward but I think there's something very healing about it and there's something which enables us to choose a different path you know when when we were at the Jesus mysteries so 99 was the beginning of a lot of attacks on religion and rightfully so in my view - but our book is dedicated to the Christ in you it's not coming from an atheistic condemn it's all a waste of time viewpoint it's going let's see it differently and I think that's a that's a much more healthy option than just dismiss it we're now into science that's all rubbish mythological mumbo jumbo it's actually going no no no we need all of it this is all part of the human experience and it's a and it's or there's a value in it huge value actually can you talk a bit more that's a really interesting metaphor talking about sort of psychotherapy for the split and the Western soul can you explain more about what that means and what it is that we've split off from and what we need to what the heat that healing looks like yeah I think we set up we set up an opposition a long time ago and then with the triumph of lid using this maps on to say in McGilchrist work about the left brain and the right brain and [Music] because he because he argues that the left brain has effectively been at war with the right brain the left brain may of being more particular being more rational and the right brain having Anna kind of more open to the oneness experience and sort of the sense of unity with all things and I I I really admire Ian's work I think he's a extraordinary man I'm not completely sure about that version of history it feels to me that we we didn't there wasn't some place where we were all in the oneness and open to that and then the the rational left brain took over and then we lost it I think that both of always being present and and that the ancient world doesn't look particularly awake to me it looks full of suffering and short brutal lives really unless you happen to be an heiress to class in which case it was you know and you could sit around and do philosophy and so it doesn't it doesn't feel like oh we had it and then we lost it it to mean some things we did but it to me it's more of an evolutionary current where we had that and then it particular eyes and and something young talks about with Christianity is it it's but there was part of an individual process by kind of narrowing it down this one man who saved everything was in some way part of this thing which happened in the West which has led to us where we're compared to our ancestors highly individuated very particular where we don't you know we're not all wearing the same things that anymore we're not we there's variation huge variation thinking in different ways and and we've had that in a way that didn't happen in the ancient world and certainly then didn't happen to me so much so that you see this break where that starts to happen with the triumph of Christianity and this monotheistic hold it has on the Western world and then the ancient soul comes back with the Renaissance and you get the discovery of the the ancient texts Atika the the platonic texts and you see the birth of this incredible awakening very much like now I think this the extraordinary awakening in the arts and in the intelligence and in its in scholarly studies in the past and it starts what's going to become science so that current coming back in now we we can see how it that has all happened then it feels like we can integrate we it's going to help us integrate our past and the whole point for doing that is to go forward is to feel that we don't have to get now stuck in this rather fallen limited reductionist science where we've ended up which is phenomenal on the one hand I mean I've so much respect for its achievements it's unbelievable what it's done and it's philosophically pretty impoverished and is literally soul destroying literally has taken this experience we're having right now have the psyche the soul and gone it's a kind of an illusion created buying a piece of meat and of no significance whatsoever really and that reductionism is so damaging to the heart to the soul so if we can integrate all of that together there maybe we can step forward into something which goes look there's value in all of that there's a there seems to be another beautiful cycle there of when things become unmovable in our culture we look into the ancient past and a few people who've spoken to you have said exactly that so what do you think is the weight or what's your particular way of doing that but there's a lot in the past and I suppose selecting what's needed for right now selecting the right wisdom it's quite important so what are some of the ways you think we can start using ancient wisdom to start moving forward in the society you know what I mean I've been embedded in it for so long so many decades it's kind of it's just in me now and so in my actual response to your question is the danger I think now is the opposite I what I see as romanticization of the past and I they're kind of a way of oh we had it then and we lost it or the people who are still living in the jungles they've got we haven't got and it just feels like look there is something which we lose you always lose something when you gain something and there's something which cultures that live in very different ways have that we don't have that's for sure but I'm really really careful of this romanticization of it as if somehow we need to get back to something I don't think we do I think we need to keep going with the evolutionary current just just we're doing we're doing fine you know it's raising place quite astonishing where we are and we're in better shape than we've ever been and we just need to keep going and integrate the thing which is which is missing and right now what is missing is well the reductionist thing is the problem because that takes everything and pulls it down to the book the most basic level and what excites me and my latest work is this emergentist view that's arriving with an evolutionary understanding which says the opposite to reduction which goes no don't reduce everything to its components actually see that greater and greater wholes are emerging greater than there's creativity to the whole process of the the universe so you've got that literally in the construction of the physical universe and the biological universe and I think also the universe of the soul which is what we're talking about when we're talking about the history of Western ideas so I find that really interesting this idea of a model of reality that is somehow inherently evolutionary and it's always going to some kind of greater whole could you talk a little bit more about that and what that means to you yeah I'll be delighted to this is my real passion my latest work which I think is my best in a book called soul story it's really trying to lay out an emergentist spiritual philosophy and the basic the basic thesis comes from my technique is a philosopher's to look at the moment because that's what I've got so what was this what's this what's this so what I see when I look at the moment is a flow of experiences so what seems to be real is time despite the people that constantly tell that it's an illusion I don't really know what that means because what I see is every moment is this flow of time so I started looking at the flow of time and it felt like ah it with what the qualities that it has in it is that every moment is a is realizing a new potentiality like this one isn't and a new and no two moments were ever the same these are obvious things but I'm fascinated by the obvious and that every moment also contains within it implicitly everything that's happened before so it feels like that's interesting so so that we have this idea in English that the past passes but it hasn't passed it's actually right here it's the time actually doesn't pass the past accumulates there's just more past and more past and more past and it's all present implicitly in the moment and that each moment has this quality of being a new realizing a new possibility and containing everything that's been before so that the moment is made of the past coexisting with the possible and that feels to me a description of the fundamental nature of what reality is so that what we're seeing 13.8 billion years ago if the dates are right is the start for our universe of a process of the realization of potentiality and as the past accumulates as there's more and more of it there is a richness of complexity which tends towards what we call evolution and trends towards the emergence of novelty so that there's a that to use a lovely line which is from Brian swim the evolutionary philosopher who I love to bits and who said something like you know what have we learned we've learned that if you take hydrogen and you wait long enough it learns to sing opera which i think is just spectacular because that's what we've looked it's like you lis take hydrogen and it will emerge eventually as you and me and and what I see in that and my attempt to integrate science was with a spiritual tradition is to go look well in this idea of evolution or over by with Darwin and Wallace and the whole idea that ever this huge variety of life came from one simple source for a stunning idea that is I mean just wow I mean and everything seems to point towards that being right and then a hundred years ago we got the idea that Noah's wasn't just biology that had evolved a whole of that the universe had evolved I mean and that some that is a mythos of such grandeur I mean this is why I say we're on we're on track guys I mean these these leaves ancient myths just like yeah whatever I mean this is big stuff now so we've got that we've got this ten billion years of the evolution of the physical cosmos then you've got the three billion years of the evolution of life and then right at the end of that you've got the evolution of psyche which is Greek for soul it's what the the Gnostics book there's a gnostic word and it means the soul and what it's pointing to what they're pointing to what the word refers to is this experience you and I are having now of a non-material reality and we're in E right now our bodies are sitting here Minds doing it say you know things you're listening and nodding that's how our bodies are doing and all the actions in a non-material realm and all the meaning isn't it is in that non material realm in the physical realm there's a monkey making funny noises but in the non material realm we are sharing meaning that's the latest thing so the whole evolutionary process is gone from basic matter to something not made of matter made of images what the reductionists do is they reduce everything to what's come before until really it's just atoms or even lower than that what the emergent ists do is they go no no no it's reality emerging on evermore at deeper levels more emergent levels so the soul the psyche is not some byproduct of anything it's a it's a level of reality well that's what spirituality says you know if you I've just been to speaking of a psychedelic festival in Hungary you know it's like what people are exploring there is salt and you can go off into it and there's it's huge there's worlds out there it's what shamanic exploration all the whole of spirituality about that world that droite for the ancient Egyptians the imaginal realm of the Sufis the Bihar dozy there's a thousand names the astral plane there's a it's a dimension so my thesis is look what spirituality does is it sees that it's pre-existent that's always been there and we have fallen from it that's the gnostic myth it's a bit very pessimistic we fall in this in life life is his awful thing which you've got trapped in a body and if you can just be spiritual enough you can get out and you never have to come back because who would want to come back to hear what the emergentist thing says is no no no actually life is a beautiful thing and it's emerging on ever deeper and more emergent levels and it's emerged as finally this world of psyche a world of the soul a world in which in my opinion we can actually survive without the body and which we can explore in great depth through spiritual practices but not as something which has always been there which unfortunately through some cosmic mess-up we fell out of but actually something which is emerging in an evolutionary current so there's three phases of evolution it's a physical the biological and then this soul phase and then at the end of that I think in this new phase is where you started David is the idea that what's coming now is this deeper awakening to this oneness with the very source that we're waking up to a fundamental oneness with where all this is come from and that's a whole new thing again it feels to me to be a really good place to to end don't like having really good wrap up yeah it's a glad story yeah Tim thank you very much it's been a pleasure you
