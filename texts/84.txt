so today I'm joined by Jonathan Paige Oh a lot of people say hello Jonathan so we can see your face hello everybody right I guess a lot of people watching this will know who you are already you you've done quite a few public events with Jordan Pederson already and yeah you actually reached out to me to to talk about the value of organized religion and it's something I don't have any sort of firm views on so it'd be really interesting subject to explore but I'd love to to start by talking about the the recent Sam Harris Jordan Peterson debates because I know you've been quite vocal about your view of of how those have gone and whether they've actually achieved anything and given that they're sort of fairly recent I think that would be a good place to start and then move on to about personal histories with Christianity the value of organized religion and then sort of maybe unpacking a few of these questions around the kind of ambivalence of Jordan Peterson's reawakening or re understanding of some of the Christian tradition and then that relation to the organized church and whether yeah that I sort of sent some tensions there that I'm fine I'm kind of interested to explore yeah yeah first of all thanks for for agreeing to talk with me I've been kind of following the videos on on and off you know I I saw the first video I remember what I saw your first video your first day with Jordan then I kind of I kind of had a little negative reaction to your to your video but then I've been following the your discussion and I saw the video with Paul and I've been seeing kind of your interpretation of things and I felt like you you really do have a this kind of desire to enter into the discussion and to to figure out what's happening maybe like just what is going on cuz obviously something is happening and there aren't that many people trying to to figure out what the the size of this thing that's happening and kind of what the ramifications and so I really appreciated your your desire to kind of take it on and engage and so I thought it would be great to to have a direct discussion with you so thanks for having me thank you just I remember what that was it was the Gnosticism line we've got I'd love to explore my friend and colleague Ali is an expert on Gnosticism or researched it quite a lot for a free book so I won't call him an expert but he researched quite a lot so he'd love to have a conversation with you at some point about Gnosticism I know yeah sure I would look I would love to do that too like I think I'm for sure it's it is it is for sure I do have a Christian perspective on Gnosticism and sometimes the let's say the Christian perspective on narcissism is polemical that's for sure and so so I kind of understand that and so I would be happy to to talk with somebody who studied it more and and and kind of Duke it out and have that discussion that it'd be great to do that great cool yeah you've said a few really insight exciting things there that I want to just question I mean you you talked about this thing that's happening and I think there's a lot of I mean what I sense on a sort of broad scale is there is a kind of intellectual awakening facilitated by the internet and the kind of the new media the ability to go down as many rabbit holes as we want yeah but how would you summarize it I think so I think it's I think what's going on I think there's also something that's going on it's that we've kind of reached the end of a certain cycle or we reach the end of a certain time where we kind of moved into a kind of nihilism you know in terms of everybody all they wanted was to you know to have the nice car and to have you know a kind of superficial superficiality and we saw that in in the news and in the way that we've been fed media for the past you know 10 20 years where you know we've been told how our attention span is shrinking and you know we need to have these 10-minute bits and then advertisements and and so we can see it on TV still like it still has that model where they they have these little short tidbits of things that they present you and then they kind of move from one thing to the next and I think that what we're seeing is is we've just reached the end of that because that's just not true that that's what human beings are we're just not we're not like that and so it's actually pushing us in a direct you know it can it's like you could say something like everyone likes to eat chocolate cake and if you give someone chocolate cake like they'll love it obviously they'll want to have more but if you eat chocolate cake for two days at some point you just get totally saturated and you want to have some veggies and I think that's where we are is that they've the the the media companies thought that they could just give us this candy forever but at some point people just got completely fed up and now they want they're looking for something a bit deeper and a bit more intense and they're not getting it from the universities for anybody who studied in university it's so ideological especially the humanities it's so ideological there's so little room for actual engagement in actual discussion actual plunging into the text of Western history that people are looking for it on the Internet and luckily we have some interesting people that are kind of coming up I think and I think that Jordan Pederson has been someone who's kind of filled fill that a place but there are some people they don't have the big as much following is Jordan but you'll find philosophers online that have you know fifty thousand followers and their view their there their lectures have you know fifty thousand views on this like obtuse concept in Heidegger or like you know reading Hegel and it's like they have fifty thousand views which is just insane it means that people are really hungry for something more than just the just the Kardashians you know yeah yeah and do you do you tie the the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson debates in any way to that sort of the changing of world views or the changing of different perspectives because I mean Harris is obviously the sort of the foremost advocate for the materialist paradigm which I at least would sort of say is partly what has led to the kind of the sense of a lack of felt meaning in people lives yeah I mean there's a great line that sorry I'll just okay there's a great line of a friend of mine came up with recently which was he said scientism is worse than jihadism because jihadism doesn't create you weapons yeah exactly that's yeah there is a kind of I think that it's interesting to see it kind of from the outside is to see in a lot of the this kind of New Atheists bunch a kind of blindness and in a kind of certainty which you actually do discover in in Jobos witnesses for example you know like this kind of absolute certainty of what they're doing and also a pros like a like a proselytizing where they just kind of want to convince you of their of their thing and so it's really funny - it's funny - guys it's funny to see that but it is kind of frightening to think like you said that behind behind you hope as witnesses all you have are really annoying conversations at the door but behind behind scientism you have artificial intelligence you have all these things like the the the trans human is for example I mean they're it's frightening how they're not they don't have wisdom to to kind of understand the the propositions that they're making this idea of putting you know let's say electronic devices in the brain to increase people's thinking and time Eris's for actually is for some of that stuff and and so it's like they they don't seem to understand the basic the basic wisdom of humanity that how that would be problematic they don't seem to be able to see what that is um but I think it's interesting it's been really interesting at first you know when Jordan was trying to kind of engage with Sam Harris I didn't totally understand why he was he was so adamant about doing so because Jordan really did want to have this discussion with him um I was actually at Jordan's house at the second discussion that Jordan had with Sam Harris you know the first one was the horrible when the two-hour like train wreck the second one wasn't so bad and I was actually at his house and we we went over like the first time Ayers debate with his son and and Jordan we watched we like we like listened to the whole thing then we kind of analyzed it where did it go wrong and everything so Jordan was really is really adamant about Sam and I kept wondering why him like why him and I think I know what it is I think I think because there is something in Sam Harris which represents a beginning of a transition it's there in him because of all the new atheist types he he has had spiritual experiences now and he can't discount them like he can't pretend like those are meaningless he knows how meaningful they are and and because of that he he does have a desire to recover something of spiritual tradition it's just that he still has like it's like he's kind of has a one foot in two worlds and he's trying to figure it out it's as if Jordan also has his foot in two worlds right Jordan isn't totally on the religious side or on the scientific side it's just that so they both have their foot in two worlds it's just that maybe one is pulling more on one side and the other is kind of pulling more on the other when it's saying there is value there's more value than you think in the religious aspect and the other is saying there's very little value in the religious thing the only thing that's that's worthy is the discussions about consciousness and and you know especially Eastern or mystical experiences like that's all that matters and so I think that that's why I think that that's why the discussion has been so engaging for people people have been so wanting to to follow it because I think people are trying to figure that out they're trying to to understand how because every I think most people do have an intuitive sense that there's more like there's any to ative sense that there's something about our being in the world which has meaning which is and you have to actually work really hard to to destroy that to just be a and most people who do that they they actually are deluding themselves cuz they say that they're just monkeys you know and they're they're just a bunch of monkeys who are saying things but but if you if you pay attention just a little while to what they're saying you realize that it's not true they have hierarchies of values they have they have spirits to which they pray they don't even know that they're praying to to certain God but they're there at the altar of certain gods and they're there there there there sometimes even possessed by those spirits you know and so so I know that's why I think it's been so interesting for people to to follow this because I think that's the discussion that people want to hear now because we it's like we have we're in a moment where we have a loss of meaning we everybody's experiencing it like there's a there's a kind of chaos of meaning a chaos of identity a sense that things are crumbling or things or we're not anymore together we live in our little suburban homes we don't know our neighbors we don't have community we don't so so all that is is real and people are looking for solutions to that in the discussion between Jordan Sam is taking people just like one little step at a time towards figuring out what that means even in terms of translating it in a way that people who are kind of scientifically minded could understand hmm yeah I do you have a sense of could I guess both of us share a sense that we think Peterson has a bigger perspective on this than Sam Harris and how do you sense that those debates have gone I mean and do you have a sense of what would need to shift for Sam to appreciate for example the fact that values have to be have to be rooted in a story for example I'd say the fundamental disagreements between them must pretty much that are they that values have to be they can't be derived rationally and they have to actually be more deep-rooted than that yeah I think that it's funny because at the end of the London discussion its Sam who started to talk about consciousness it's like towards the end of the discussion and I felt like ah this is the place this is the spot where the discussion the next step of the discussion needs to happen the thing is that Jordan Jordan is Jordan doesn't hasn't studied a lot let's say in terms of Eastern tradition terms of in terms of Buddhism and also even in terms of Christianity he hasn't studied the mystical tradition so much and so the idea of not just having a spiritual vision let's say but actually elevating your consciousness as we say or transforming your consciousness to to become more to be freer to be to be less bound by our multiplicities less bound by our passions all that stuff that is in the mystical tradition I think that that's the key for Sam that's the that's the discussion that is going to help him break break his way that he sees some of some of this stuff like what I would like to have like if I had a discussion with Sam Harris I would just say okay look I know you don't like religion yeah I'm religious that's fine let's not talk about that cuz gonna be a dead end let's talk about consciousness let's talk about that and let's lay it out okay what does a world in which consciousness is central how does it lay itself out how does attention lay itself out right it laid itself out in terms of hierarchies terms of higher kids you have a point of attention and then around that point lay the world kind of flows out into chaos which is on the edge even in your visual frame that's how it worked right so you have points of attention and then on the edges you have this chaotic space which is which is kind of gray and not totally there so you say okay so now let's take that experience of consciousness and let's say that that's the foundation of reality that's what he says he says that's the foundation of reality well is there an analog to that in a community what does that look like what does a commute what does the analog of consciousness in a community look like it looks like it looks like gathering together around a point looks like turning around appointed it sits circumambulation it's a it's a it's it's a hierarchy of social of structure and it ends up looking like a religious ritual that's what it looks like right because that's that's religious rituals are have the same structure as the structure of consciousness so I think that that and then how does what does that look like in time what does the experience of consciousness to look like if you see it with the frame of time and what it looks like is a story it's the same and so I think that that's that would be the work that I think could kind of help Sam Harris move a little bit further down down the road I don't know he's he's actually also his whole world is his whole career his everything about him is caught up in his in his position and so you I don't know I don't know if he'd be willing to make that move I thought the debates themselves were very frustrating I thought they were useful in the sense that I thought that Jordan had a chance to say what he wanted to say and I think that people in the audience people are going to be listening to it some of them are going to be rolling make the work to do the work some of the some of the schemes that he laid out like the scheme of human sacrifice I thought was like if you're if you're honest and you and you're honestly attentive to what he's saying you will see how strong what he's laying out is and how evolutionary correct like in terms of just evolutionary thinking how correct what he's laying out is and so I think that some of the viewers will probably be willing to make the work I don't know but for Sam I think consciousness India I don't know I think he was gonna do a an interview with Don Hoffman I don't know if he did it but I think that someone like Don Hoffman could help Sam kind of move forward like Don Hoffman I don't know if you know about about him did you follow that what you're talking about is that is the phenomenology of consciousness yeah you're sort of basically saying this is the way that you get you you try and argue some heresy the phenomenology of consciousness what does it look like because that's what he says that's what he says is the basis of reality and the thing is that the phenomenology of consciousness doesn't actually transfer easily into scientific thinking it's actually scientific thinking is actually quite far from phenomenological consciousness phenomenological conscious actually looks way more like a very primitive vision of the world where there's up there's down you know and your whole experience is there to tell you when you're up and down because when your head is upside down you don't feel right you know you don't feel right and so that your whole body and your whole experience is there to experience heaven and earth and is there to experience time and is there to experience also limited attention and then a hierarchy of attention and and that's how we set up our communities everything set up that way so I would kind of move through that with him to to get him to understand what these stories are about so yeah so that's that's kind of that's what we're trying to that's what I'm trying to do like my brother mature he wrote a book on cosmic symbolism in Genesis and that's exactly what he's trying to do he's trying to bring it back to consciousness and show you how the structures in in Genesis the stories are basically that's what they're talking about you know the story in Genesis the creation story it's obvious that that's what it's talking about at least in part I mean you have the use of word you have this notion of opening your eyes and then being self aware and and then actually covering yourself to protect yourself from the outer world it's like the whole story of the fall it's obviously talking about consciousness it evens that's what it is it's a sum it's a being who who acquires a certain type of consciousness and then the effects of that consciousness on that being I don't see how you can't see it it's obvious that's quit it's about anyways yeah it's I think you also spoke to that it's it's very hard once someone has established a position written a lot of books on a certain perspective to to go through an experience of having to change their minds I think that's that's a that's a big part of it but I think I think that it it's not it's not I think it's not impossible in a way Sam Sam is also someone who is who is honest he has these paths he has these weird patterns that he falls into you know and it's like Jordan Jordan was talking about I mean he laid out this amazing discussion about this this notion of of a mimetic process by which we identify the ideal man the ideal human and then we project this ideal human and we represent him in the dome of a church into heaven right of of your experience and then we look up together towards that mimetic representation and then we see it as the model by which we live our lives and then sam harris is like yeah but what about finding out fundamentalists it's like that's all he could say was what about fundamentalist what about it's like you're not this discussion is not moving forward it's not in it you could do this with anything you could do that with anything and I love when Jordan said do it take stories do it do it with the Hindu stories please Sam do it if you say that you can do it with anything do it maybe it'll give you some insight into into how these stories work and how this stuff works and it's not that it's not all arbitrary and it and it's not just a bunch of stories we tell each other you you can't escape even if you enter into an evolutionary way of thinking you can't escape it everything you do to be within that so our stories have to be part of it our concepts have to be part of it everything has to be part of it you can't just discount an aspect of humanity as if it doesn't matter because that means you're not trying to understand what it means what it is to be human can't just say it's silly well you have to be able to it's there you have to be able to talk about it because that's also part of of the yeah let's say the the emergent phenomena like you have to be able to talk about it yeah and it also speaks to that paradox that the Peterson points out about you can either be an evolutionary thinker or you can be an atheist who doesn't see how those two things fit together or you have to admit that religion has some something this long-lasting and powerful must have some evolutionary benefit yeah and also the idea that for example that we want to discount irrationality that we want to be rational it's like okay well then you're not taking into account the fact that we're irrational I mean we are obviously irrational to like it's it's obvious that we are and so they're much there are reasons there are purposes for our irrationality it's not like irrationality contains the entire scope of human experience so if you want to say that that you can only filter the world to rationality then you're you're definitely creating something which is going to be lopsided and and what I think and what Jordan thinks is that it's going to create a totalitarian result because you're you're unaware like you're totally unaware of what of what the that other aspect of ourselves is so yeah so it's it's a very it's a very strange yeah this is something I've heard I think in the in those debates Sam calling what what Jordan believes dangerous quite a few times I maybe I haven't heard enough Viktor does Jordan describe what Harris believes are dangerous as well or is it kind of a one-sided discussion on that on that front I think that I think that it's interesting because I think Jordan I think it's will Sam's retort to - Jordan is that you know all the the horrors of the 20th century and let's say the late 19th and early 20th century those were still religious so religious thinking that we're continuing you know and and I think that that's where Jordan kind of he once in a while he'll give like a like a thing okay talk about Mao and Stalin and then Sandra toward his no that's still religion and I think that Jordan hasn't totally figured out a way to to kind of move past that without starting to argue and he doesn't I don't think he wants wants to argue but I think that that's and because it's Sammy was so funny the way he dealt with that in that discussion where Jordan brought that up and Sam said I'm gonna deal with this cuz I'm sick of hearing this argument like I'm sick of hearing it and I'm gonna deal with it once and for all then he said something like it's he said what you would expect no that's still religion but it's like I'm not convinced my buddy I'm not convinced at all because it was already there in the French Revolution you know all that was already there in the French Revolution in a smaller scale but we're talking we're now we're talking about tens of thousands and maybe up to a few hundred thousand people that were slaughtered because of reason like they they clearly said that that that the motivating factor behind their action was reason science progress that's exactly what they said and they even had the cult of Reason where they they destroyed all the the church they would empty out the churches and they used the church building to celebrate reason and so they would all get together and celebrate reason and and and that happened in the blood of the peasants like that have been soaking in in in Catholic blood so I think that I think that I think that that's kind of a it's a frustrating thing and I think that's I also actually also think that's what makes sense position dangerous is because he thinks that he is innocent he thinks that he's innocent and that his position is only innocent he always says something like atheism just means the belief in no God there is no positive aspect to to atheism now we want to propose after that let's leave that aside and we want to propose some positive things and he's in the position where he can say well what I propose has never been tried it doesn't exist and so hi it's so beautiful look at how beautiful what I'm proposing is and he doesn't he can't he can't underst and the side effects of what she's proposing can't understand how when you do something you cannot you don't necessarily know the ramifications on the side and so he complains I'd say about about North American nihilism and their obsession with their cars and with celebrities but then he somehow sees that it is negative but then he wants a secular society it's like well maybe a secular society gives that because that's what happened and the other alternative to that too like the kind of mall going fat you know diabetes like maybe the only opposite to that is to anchor yourself in something like reason or nation or something lower on the the hierarchy and then becoming a yeah becoming an ideologue and and then just going and destroying churches or you know killing whatever group that is going to be killed because he's not part of your thing so anyways I like I said I've said this in the describe before I don't think Sam Harris is the one who'd go out and and burn churches obviously not it would be more like the FARC type you know like Varg would you would take the atheism to go in and destroy churches it wouldn't be Sam but in the wake of what he's proposing that's what those are that's what's gonna happen I like I can't see anything besides that
