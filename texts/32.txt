[Music] we've been interested for quite a while in the IDW Jordan Pederson and what feels like a kind of great intellectual awakening so far it's been a bit of a countercultural phenomenon and a lot of people are kind of described it as being on the right or being against the left and so what we're really interested in doing is kind of unpicking what the left has to learn from the IDW movement itself whether you kind of agree with them politically or whatever if you watch some of these some of these programs are there at Weinstein Bret Weinstein Jordan Peterson Ben Shapiro you realize that they are talking about very fundamental things very important fundamental things there's a real awareness of the challenges that we face as a society so it seems the right thing to do is to try and understand that to be part of that conversation and I'll just say a part of what drew me into listening more and more to these folks is like being challenged and then saying wow but they're also really smart they're doing their conversations as you said slowing conversations down instead of five minutes sound bytes on legacy media you know media forms which are so simplifying and reductionistic it's allowing people to sit and think out loud together in long-form ways and tease apart really complex ideas but they're also able to touch on really hot-button issues that have kind of been off limits in certain ways especially when you set them at the left the left have certain topics and issues and if you don't tow the line you can easily be exiled or if nothing else questioned and frowned upon but they're starting to touch on some of these and you can say what you want about many of them and obviously I don't agree with a lot of things a lot of them say but they're modeling how to have conversations and talk about things and they're smart people and even if you disagree it's really refreshing to have real discourse and intellectual people talking about really important issues and I will say I mean I think you're right and you've said this before around compared with the right and the complete control over the government the United States and jail cells and guns and elite police and military the left has more soft power it's more in the academia and universities also Hollywood and cultural you know forms I will say when I was first encountering Peterson and Ike challenged but then intrigued by some of his critiques to the left and then I came talked about this that slide into you know Soviet Union and and and genocide and you know gulag but then I was also hearing about Brett Weinstein at Evergreen and I was really curious so when I finally watched that live raw footage of what happened to Evergreen it was really shocking and it was like I just didn't expect to see that you know young people people of color and white allies fighting for racial justice and diversity inequity doing this mob mentality of a white man who was a white man but who's also a Bernie supporter and Occupy Wall Street guy solidly on the Left solidly and Ally and to watch just how that unfolded and it ends by them wandering the the campus with baseball bats and disarming the police and of course the president of the college did not help with that situation it brought up that question of like it's not a gonna be this totalitarian takeover but it's also not completely benign if if you if you imagine people gaining more power with that kind of fanatic chaotic mob mentality which you know people are implications critique which I still grapple with is I think he quotes Orson Welles or someone saying the bourgeoisie it's not so they're not driven so much by love for the poor as much as by hatred and envy of the rich and that's really touchy and that's a fine line but I hear naming that when sometimes when I see it playing out folks on the Left I'm like doesn't feel this open-hearted compassionate focus on the poor it side there's a lot of shadow a shadow and there's a need for direct action and to vism that disrupt systems but a point that Bret Weinstein makes is that universities are not the right target to be channeling all that energy channel that into organizing to vote out you know Republicans in Congress or channel that into you know protesting police brutality and police violence like the university is is this really safe protected area that does already value these things yeah and is so much more progressive than society at large why are you wasting energy well that's the paradox I think because it's a soft target right you can have wins yeah like if you if you target your kind of accusations of bigotry at progressive people they will take it seriously oh my god and I'm sorry am I am I is there a microaggression here I'm and where is the people on the right yeah well won't listens much right so it's it's kind of it's yeah it is the soft targets in some in some sense but that you mentioned the intellectual diet web and I think that's there's two things going on there's there's the nature of the the views of the people within it and there's the nature of the conversation and I think that is why you also talked about it is a really enlivening experience and I had the same experience watching some of the Dave Rubin shows with my the Weinsteins and Peterson Shapiro there's a sense of intellectual adventure yes in these conversations and I think on the Joe Rogan show as well there's a sense of that's what thinking looks like and I think we've been starved of actually seeing people thinking yes and I would say another piece of it was that I I've never really engaged to be perfectly honest and listened with real integrity and openness to conservative thinkers people on the right I've been I was so in the left bubble that it was like legitimately my my belief was we on the left are just right which is right about everything so we just need to like wait for the people on the right to wake up and realize this there are they're completely off yeah there's stupid or evil or something can't really understand why they are ever they are and so engaging and watching some of these conversations in the intellectual dark web has really helped drive home this perspective which was new to me around it's not that the Conservatives in the right or our right are correct but it's like we on the Left we need the Conservatives for that dialectic we need to think together to come to new truths and if you cut out one side of it that's that's inherently problematic and so you get the idea of like we need diversity of viewpoints if we're all about inclusivity and diversity and inclusion we need to be inclusive of different political you know beliefs different viewpoints and I think on the left that can be it can be really dried you know you don't have that which is the paradox of the left the obsession with diversity but diversity within a very ideologically kind of narrow yes and so you have some folks having really interesting conversations that go into taboo spaces were on the left you can't go if you bring those up it's really you become a lightning rod and there's folks here who are you know and I think it was Peterson or someone was speaking about the intellectual dark web and they said if we're gonna argue and disagree I want to hear the best argument for that like we don't want to set up straw man you know and bad arguments you can dunk on and you want to find people who are really intelligent and articulate and can give you the best argument for that if you're pro-life what's the best argument for your belief in that we're like let's at least engage on on a higher level of intellectual discourse yeah and you know this issue of the complexity of the world and of the society that we live in right now has come up and I have found in talking to friends of mine who are into the intellectual dark will have been also have a background in complexity theory of a friend of mine who I've been arguing with over politics for a decade now he's always pointing out to me that you know universal health care for example other societies have instituted this decades ago and their systems are not perfect but maybe better than what we have in the United States but given our unique cultural situation or unique history it's not a simple matter to transition from what we have now to something else and we don't because of the complexity of the issue we don't know what could go wrong in that transition you could end up worse than we are right and so it's got me thinking okay maybe we need to move more slowly here I do think that everyone should have health care as a right that's my value proposition but how do we get there I don't think the insurance companies are gonna be much help but it's like we need to make allies here and and create a system that won't lead to a collapse which wasn't predicted because the value can guide you to the end but the mean still remains to be discovered I think it's that back to that point the first stage for me has to be getting learning how to be nonreactive yeah and it's interesting that we both can teach meditation know and practice like that is effectively the practice it's being able to yourself is the observer and the content being observed having that distance between I think without that ability it's almost impossible to have the conversation because we know from strong evidence from neuroscience that we make decisions emotionally first and then post rationalize them second later so with that in mind it's no surprise to me that until now there's been just a deep polarization and I think I see that in the intellectual dark web I see a level of non reactivity with mmm I kind of just disagree with that they're disagreeing with each other but kind of having a generative conversation I think that's where some of the power lies of spreading that apps assigning like hey let's have a conversation where we're not just in a reactive loop mm-hmm and it is about having a position as well and coming back to your point about politics something I heard Brett and Eric talk about was we know that none of the solutions work we know that libertarianism doesn't work for game theoretic reasons we know that capitalism doesn't work for game theoretic reasons we know that socialism won't work for game theoretic reasons we know all of these sort of solutions don't work so let's we have a blank slate we have all we have a yeah we have we have to work with our evolutionary toolkit because we know these this is what we've been given and work within that so that's a that's also a kind of a really interesting place to start this conversation from as well which I think most of the people within the intellectual dark web would say certainly from a political perspective we're starting from zero because we know none of the solutions are going to get us through right right and yet we also have to start where we are unless there's gonna be a complete collapse and sometimes you need the blank slate before you can build something new I'm not sure if we should be inviting that or at all it's too excited about that you know that could be this situation afternoon but you know I really like to think about this in terms of media technologies the evolution of human consciousness is simultaneously the evolution of media technologies communication technology is you know it used to be the drama around the fire and just primal speech and song and then the first script alphabetic consciousness radio or sorry the printing press we can't skip that without the printing press there's no democracy radio television the Internet there are specific modes of consciousness facilitated by each of these technologies and the intellectual dark web is very much the the birth of a new media environment superseding the old mass media technology is decentralizing thought you know in a way that mass media was able to sort of get a handle on and you know the printing press was what allowed for the French Revolution the Protestant Reformation information the American Revolution and print consciousness literate consciousness the type that will read pamphlets newspapers is a very non reactive form of consciousness in a sense it's more intellectual and less emotional it's not that there was an emotion involved in politics before radio and television but people were able to consider the argument and sit through a tower or lincoln-douglas debate you know can you imagine people sitting through a towers of politicians debating with one another no way so with with radio you had the risk of fascism you know was being developed in the 30s and there's one voice the Fuhrer who's disseminating this image of the fatherland you know all across Central Europe and and then with television which really came to the fore in the 60s that's when images were coming back from Vietnam and people were seeing what war actually looks like for the first time and that generated this tremendous outpouring of compassion in the anti-war movement right so but the the blue churches Jordan green home calls it has had control over television and newspapers for decades now but that media landscape that environment is is dying off it's really only people over 35 that I think still look to the Washington Post in the New York Times and CNN and MSNBC young people are online and they're getting their information from these more unique it's it's there's more diversity online in terms of the conversations that are being you're also starting to see the way it's breaking down legacy media's CNN MSNBC it's too centralized so up that movement to like blockchain and like digital currencies is I think happening in the same way it's decentralized with all the beauty and excitement and also the challenges and pitfalls but I think you're starting to see you know this post truth world where suddenly there can be fake news on the left and New York Times doing these hit pieces on Peterson that is just promoting blatantly false you know insinuations and accusations and so suddenly is like what is true what's not and that dovetails into you know when I toured in green halls and Daniel smacking burgers pieces around sense-making and like what is sense making our our capacity to make sense of the world and then be able to be agents and have agency and make decisions and choices through having you know sense of meaning and understanding but it's like data overload so on the one hand it's decentralizing we're also getting completely swamped with data information viewpoints how do we sort that what sources do we look to like and I think that's what some the intellectual dark web is doing when I'm overwhelmed of sense making its alternative sense to me and it's been the cracks but that's opening and the electricity that's there that we both talked about people are flocking to and it's showing people are hungry and thirsty and and deprived of some of this form of discourse thinking and conversation and I think as a journalist I've kind of looked at the influx of fake news and the kind of the continuing downward spiral of the news media and been very concerned by it like it's like I work the longer very talented people I know that this kind of anti journalism kind of conspiracy theory is not it's at least only partially true and I've sort of seen since I've been outside the media that there are ways of groupthink though there's certainly a way of groupthink and there's a certain kind of bias to the media this is a blue church thing that Jordan Greenhalgh talks about and more aware of that since I've been out of it but I'm also aware of the difficulty of producing good news the amount of money that it costs to send someone to the Middle East for a long time and understand what's going on and all these things so I've been kind of looking at how quickly it's losing its credibility and been really worried by that like it's it's like we're losing the best some of that's irreplaceable some of that's irreplaceable and then it's only since the the breakthrough of the intellectual diet web conversation that I've got a sense that there is a kind of bottom-up new sense making apparatus that's being selected for by the internet but these people are being selected for by their by the number of people watching them and Dave Rubin talks about they're always being forced together because they're being asked to go on each other's podcasts there's a there is hopefully a new sense making and I also think this is probably an early stage the intellectual dark web is I've kind of called it a beachhead it's like a kind of beachhead into enemy territory to say okay we're gonna have to start having a new kind of conversation and I I also think that it may well be in some sense the intellectual dark web died it was named by the New York Times because it's no longer the dark web and that framing of these are the voices that are being kept out of the mainstream conversation immediately flips into no these are new media entre you idiot medias entrepreneurs who are creating alternative to the mainstream media me Joe Rogan gets what ninety a hundred million downloads and views a month yeah allegedly he's the most powerful podcaster so most powerful media person who's ever lived so the idea of that it was a fascinating thing like at the moment of it being named it ceased to be what it was so that's one of the things and you said this Matt like Joe Rogan seems to just have whoever he wants Andres podcast they could be timeout UFOs and aliens psychedelics people like Peterson or Ben Shapiro you know but there's something refreshing about well here's a mansion guy with a huge reach a huge audience and it seems that whoever he's interested in and he doesn't have to agree with them on anything just to have and that's something that's really refreshing and this seems important yeah and I think the other thing with Joe Rogan is because you would never think of Joe Rogan as an intellectual in the same way that say Brett Weinstein or Eric Weinstein is but he is part of the intellectual dark word because of the nature of the kind of conversations he's able to host that he he's genuinely interested he's genuinely learning and he's genuinely inquiring and there's that expand the conversation beyond just academia or those who identifies intellectuals and it and it Flags up how and this is something Jordan green halls talked about as well is that we have because of the increased complexity of the world and the chaotic nature of of existing in it we've increasingly replaced thinking with a facsimile of thinking reactivity responses and what this is again flagging up is oh this is this is actually what thinking looks like where you're able and that's a it's a process of courage and it's a process of self-reflection and all of these things it's it's yeah mass media trans people to say what sounds smart in education major mainstream university education generally trains people to say what sounds smart in other words it's not what's actually thought through rigorously for oneself it's what's gonna advance you in the type of society that we live in and you know one thing that's great about the intellectual dark web is that I get the sense that they're accountable to their audience mainstream media is not accountable to their audience they're accountable to their advertisers because that's who's paying the bills that's right all right so that's a huge that's a huge difference and that allows them to be flexible nimble and they'll just be like okay we've been asked to two of us to do a podcast or let's have the four of us sit down they're on a different they're like guerrilla you know warfare it's just a different a different mode of interacting and it's clearly effective and that was to Jordan green halls idea of the blue church versus the red the blue is still trying to catch up the legacy news media and the left which is kind of become their hegemony like the mainstream no longer the counter cultural force is trying to understand how Trump and some of this right you know some of the red church has like a real warfare and we're still lining up like in the Civil War and we're trying to figure out the technology or the moves that they're making and until we can figure that out they're gonna run circles around us and I think we're just really in this in-between space of trying to understand what the landscape is I pick up as well I don't think I mean in the UK at least we don't really have much advertising in news the BBC is is advertising free I used to work for Channel four News which barely has an advertising as well but there is still the same same groupthink and I think actually a much more a much more powerful force is peer pressure it's what other people will think of you it's it's the groupthink within within within any media industry I'm not so sure the advertisers have much have much power over that at least at the the level of the individual decisions of the reporters it's much more am I a good person if I think this what will my friends think of me what will other people in the newsroom the reporters I know I'm much more worried about what other reporters think of them and other people within the industry think of them than the people outside it does depend though I think you know with gamergate that the way that sort of began was you know popular gaming websites very much a church siding with the publishers when gamers were complaining about certain things and that created it sits a little microcosm of what's happening now in the wider scale yeah it's we cannot trust us sense makers therefore we need new sense making apparatuses yeah that's right yeah I mean it might be a little different in the UK versus here because advertising bombards you on you know cable news networks especially maybe not as much on broadcast television but you know activists on the left have learned that if you want to get someone like sean hannity or anyone on fox news to apologize for something go after their advertising revenue and tell those companies that you're not gonna buy their products if they don't pull their ads from that show and then all the sudden the tune changes on the show so that's yeah i mean that's that's an interesting difference between the UK and the US as well yeah this is a game coming back to brett and erik weinstein talking about it which i think is a really great understanding certain types of things do not survive encounter with the profit motive and truth-seeking in particular does not survive an encounter with the profit motive so universities news anything that involves seeking truth is corrupted by by by money in and so i think yeah it probably is a very different situation here and I think there's something speaking for the the farsightedness of the people who put the BBC together in the 1920s was this is such a powerful technology that we need to have it at least an arm's length from government and an arm's length from commercial pressures which which I guess you don't have we have National Public Radio NPR but everyone on the right thinks that it's controlled by the government but it's also I mean the BBC is this massive organization it's got huge number TV stations huge number of radio stations I mean no it's not like the comparison is NPR's tiny yeah yeah you get people really railing against peterson with his patreon account and people making a lot of money but a part of me is like okay so you set up a patreon account of people like what you're doing you can be supported and that's also just a different model you know it's decentralized to a certain extent I'm sure there's problems with it it's a viewership paying directly for the kind of content that they'd like to see yeah and and Peterson and these other guys seem to be pretty responsive to what their audience asks of them yeah you know that's what's driving their whole the media operation yeah so it's not like these huge companies creating content that they think will be good for their advertisers or that their bubble suggested is what people want to hear and then they just beam it out at everyone there's a new feedback mechanism there's interaction here great mmm I'm interested to ask you guys where you think we are we we just got an email from Ken Wilbur's people and they're tracking the same sort of thing Ken will be the integral philosopher our suggestion my suggestion in one of the the articles that I wrote was that what is happening is an emerging integral conversation so integral for people who don't know is is the idea that there are ideological ways of looking at the world and integral is a kind of almost like an evolutionary step change beyond that into a space where we're able to see all the ideologies but able to kind of access a place beyond that and that to me feels accurate as a kind of diagnosis and I'm fascinated to what you guys make of why it's emerging now what it shows about the society we're in and where it might be going as a as a conversation well I do think I remember hearing and it might have been Jeff Salzburg on daily the walls were this city of the intellectual dark web is integral you know like on the one hand yes like trying to I think a lot of people in the integral community are trying to grapple with say Jordan Peterson one minute he's feeling completely integral the next moment he's sounding not trying to unpack it I know there's no clear you cross the threshold in you are an integral you're not you're always moving back and forth whatnot I guess you could stabilize or Center and more one stage than another but I know one critique or one challenge for Peterson and maybe the intellectual dark web in general is that when they start to critique post-modernism either scientific materialism or the worldcentric post-modernism as if it's a mistake and there should be more of a movement backwards or away from that might not be constituting integral thinking because in in integral philosophy or theory you want to transcend and include all the stages and modalities of thinking and all the truths prior so you want to move into and above and beyond scientific materialism which can be very reductionist stick and materialistic you know empirically back to science to include more of the numinous than mythological the spiritual metaphysical but it's different than the mythic or the magical their archaic levels and I think sometimes I think of it as like chakra systems you know there's truth to each chakra and a lot of people in the self-help or on the left or in the there loves Paris would love that yeah exactly but there are these Hattie or that these spiritual centers but there's like I see Petersen sometimes is reclaiming like amber orange amber red and these lower chakras I get your room in order learn how to really to money and to sex and to power and those are difficult shadow places especially folks in a spiritual yeah community I suppose the question is how big can your container be you know how big is an individual how much can you hold and that's that's part of the that's where I see the link with the intellectual dark web and the integral whether or not it's an entirely integral way of looking at the world I'm not sure I think it's it's you know as you said it goes up and down and it's just more chaotic than that but you know I much get that sense of that's what's needed is the ability to you said be able to hold the pre-modern as well as the the kind of the higher levels of you know understanding and you know you mentioned the pre trans fallacy before it's it's also being able to pick out when is that pre-modern understanding actually supporting a bigger integration of society as a whole because we do need all of those things and I think it is confusing for people because you know Peterson one you know is there's many different Peterson's in a way but part of integral is that you can hold all of these different levels of development and honor them and know that they each have their own place within the whole mm-hm and so that's really you know that's an exciting prospect to see society moving towards there but it is like a birth it's um hard yeah I mean I've studied Wilber deeply from for probably five or six years starting around a time I was like 19 through Wilber I got interested in this Swiss cultural historian and cultural phenomenologist jean gebser who inspired Wilbur in many ways and also Sri Aurobindo who is connected to the founding of CI is actually another integral philosopher and I really like Jeffers way of framing the evolution of the human species he's a little suspicious of the term evolution because it implies progress and for gebser the consciousness moves through these structures in a way that's both both progressive and regressive you gain something and you lose something with each movement until you get to the integral which then it reclaims everything alright so the archaic structure is when we're still primal people's immersed within nature no sense of differentiation between the human being has some special species with a spirit that none of the rest of nature has right then you get magical consciousness it's the next structure where human beings begin to grapple with the power that comes from language and symbol and you know they're they're gaining a sense for Shan shamanic practice and ritual and then from there you move to the mythic where story and narrative becomes more pronounced so it's not just like the power of single words it's the power of the whole narratives and then with the modern period right around the time of you know me goes back to Aristotle in the ancient Greeks and then the Scientific Revolution that replaces the mythic consciousness with this new sense of the empowered intellect and science and technology that can remake the world too as we see fit for our own human purposes and that mental structure tends to cut itself off from its mythic and magical and archaic roots it's all the upper chakras and it denies and represses everything below that as a rational and needing to be at least controlled if not eliminated like root out like Sam Harris no patience for magic no patience for myth we've just got to live in the rational mind right the integral structure which is not we're not there yet but the intellectual dark weapon I feel like it is at least a space of possibility where that conversation keeping the current post modernity should probably be called hyper modernity because when you look at these post modern philosophers so-called they didn't call themselves that but they got labeled that Jacques Derrida Michele Foucault shield Toulouse Felix Guattari they're using their deeply studied in the history of Western philosophy so for someone like Peterson to say that these guys are undermining a Western project I if they were around to talk to him about philosophy we'd see very quickly to the expert in Western philosophy some of his critiques I feel like are missing the target he's not critiquing Dario he's critiquing college undergrad graduates who haven't really read there right now or maybe they've heard a few things from their professor about him so like those actual theorists are not the enemy there are a lot of I think helpful tools intellectual tools and ideas that we need to incorporate into whatever the integral is if you want to fight against fascism Jill to lose and Felix Guattari wrote some great books that were trying to really initiate people into a form of consciousness that would be immune to any sort of fascist authoritarian takeover mmm and so when I hear Peterson Braille against the postmodern theorists I'm like dude you haven't read enough this is also where we can all play with the emerging integral or what's coming next because you have people like Peterson who is bringing some important points and perspectives and then he's missing the mark and mischaracterizing Foucault yeah nobody's perfect but it's great because then we can hear that and say okay great let's take some of these points that Peterson's point out to some real shadows on the left and then post murder knee you see where he's lining up with people like Ken Wilber jean gebser or whatnot and you can bring in people who really know the philosophy within post modernity or post post modernity or hyper modernity and we can start to synthesize and kind of piece together what is that's not it that's not it that's not it but what's the new and Adam Roberts on our podcast did something great which I guess it was Foucault I don't remember about when the new shows up it's monstrous yeah it often shows up as monstrous but you can feel an archetypal charge there and Newman is charged that's electric and that is just signaling whether you love it or hate it or polarized by it it's touching into a nerve center on the collective unconscious level on an archetypal level what's happening and that's what I love young and Peterson's idea of young bringing in psychology we're trying to make sense of because it's one thing when you're talking about your own individual psychology and I love James Hillman you know here's all about we've had a hundred years of psychotherapy and the world is getting worse it's like what is going on and he wants to bring psychology out of the consulting room out of the one-on-one it's about me my problem my pain this is just my childhood my mom to this my dad did this and bring it into the world I would bring it into politics into environmentalism but also I love the project of Hillman because he's reinventing he's saying if we take psychology with just the care of soul and the study of soul and we look at the daemon as and the soul and the kind of the spiritual core of us it all gets flattened and here is probably with Wilbur and Peterson by flatland you know scientific materialism which only keeps us horizontal and the superficial level of material reality on that point and to your point as well of this cutting off from the lower archaic levels with which we need III often wander in my head with with Peterson and Harris having these debates I'm like is is it not the same as psychology being stuck in the consulting-room in a sense because in order to integrate the the pre-modern archaic what Terence Mckenna called the archaic revival that's an experiential mode of being not an intellectual one so they can debate for a hundred years and probably Harris won't shift into feeling the numinous and kind of being down and dirty in a cave dance to be like oh god you know that's a tension that I think is it's yet to be resolved because part of it you know I think parents McKenna was right part of that archaic revival is reclaiming those ritual traditions which for scientific materialist is total woowoo you know and so it's a it's a it's a difficult tension to resolve but it's one I think needs to be resolved in a different way than purely through debate that's important but there needs to be something else some experiential element yeah yeah yeah I guess this this is sort of pointing forward as well towards what a deeper resolution might be because we've talked as well about the intellectual potentially I see the intellectual dark web potentially coming to some kind of synthesis in terms of I already think that some of them are approaching that like Brett Weinstein talks about how all maps must all true maps must align so that you can get there through evolutionary biology you can understand kind of the world using the evolutionary biology map you can get there through Jungian psychology and those two kind of they map onto each other quite well you have the shadow you have these biological drives that need to be integrated you have and then you've got potentially sort of other other maps that also point in the same direction and we probably argue that Wilber has has got one of those Maps as well but that intellectual synthesis is only part of the the issue and then you've got the potential for as Ali was saying you've got to integrate the archaic you've got to integrate sort of the bodily the the embodiment piece is is such a key part because we're not going to get there just with the Internet mm-hm and that's also a Rick tarnis talks a lot about this right he'll map in his classes this large cycle where you start more in an archaic magical you know participation mystique and then you come through in the new modernity in your postman tree and on his graph it's like we're entering just entering into the underworld and it's a descent right it's the dis the mythic descent into the underworld it's the dissolution it's we're feeling everything starting to shake and and buckle and it's like fractally all these lines of division it's like what the center cannot hold and a part of that might be again playing loose with the words but like that solar masculine driving maybe mental is coming in and it's about incorporating the shadow it's about the sacred marriage with the feminine bringing in the embodiment the primordial experience as a culture having lost all technologies of Rick most technologies of ritual and transformation and very few elders who are initiated in these mystery traditions that have held societies or cultures together in many ways so we're kind of entering into this you know calabasas robert bly talks about cat abysus it's like the descent you don't know what that's gonna look like we can all feel it whether we know how to speak to it or not and I think we're just here I'm enjoying being this conversation and following the folks in the intellectual dark web just trying to feel into what's happening how can we best show up in this moment how can we offer something to be of service I think service to other human beings is such an important part of meaning making and feeling like a life well-lived don't want to just be sitting here intellectualizing and thinking I'm very much trying to find that alignment between thinking out loud with really intelligent people and then how do we act how we lived those values in the world important yeah yeah I do find myself resonating quite a bit with Peterson's message about the individual as like the source of the sacred and the the value that all societies must uphold as the highest if they hope to avoid various forms of oppression and it makes me think that individual it's not individualism as an ideology that he's talking about because that in a secular context is it it degrades into just selfishness and get what I can for myself and maybe my family would be the one you know ethical sphere that I'd include as part of myself but unless our culture can rediscover the sacred then the individual becomes just it it devolves into another ideology mmm what happens after death and what is this life for if my individuality my ego will dissolve at the death of this body how do we channel that sacred value of the individual into a collective project mmm where what I do in this life in service to individuality also in some way opens out into a society where we're all looking out for each other because you know there's this retreat into a kind of nationalism as resources become more scarce and I don't think that's the way forward it's not the way backward doesn't put it plainly the only way out is through if we're not gonna become international and we can't do it the way global capitalism tried where like we discussed earlier it's like well you can have your religion and your culture just don't believe in it too much that you're not able to shop at the grocery store get a job and stuff we can't do it that way we need to acknowledge this cultural pluralism but in a way that there's some deeper value Peterson I love this phrase he refers - it is a low-resolution grand narrative mmm a grand narrative that's not so specific that you lose the diversity and you force everyone to conform to one story but also not so diffuse that there's no common value system then can guide our activities as human beings into the future because this is not a very big planet and despite the idea that capitalistic economists keep preaching that we can keep growing growing growing it's we're not gonna be able to do that so what do we do what are we here for what do we value most what do we want to be doing you know there's a want to speak to the paradox of individual individualism or the individual yeah because I think it's a kind of cat the way I say it is a kind of catch-22 like I'm I'm also very energized by Peterson's focus on the individual I've done a lot of sort of personal growth work a lot of individual development and some people would sort of describe that sort of selfish or solipsistic and my experience is that only by really going deeply into myself and really identifying kind of the things that I have that keep me selfish keep me divided from other people am I really able to come into community with other people am I really able to make true contact with others and feel that empathy and feel that kind of that for me is that the ultimate catch-22 and I think it's a big sticking point for the left when they hear people talking like Peterson talking about individual the individual because like no no it's about the collective it's about the society my sense is you cannot jump to that point you can only get to that point from a genuine felt sense once you've done the individual work and individuation that you then feel that you're then acting in the society from a place of genuine empathy genuine connection genuine otherwise you're prop you're almost certainly playing out your shadow and playing you'll you're crap in the world and this is and it's yeah it's a really good point something Alan Watts used to talk about as well it's that and I think I see this a lot on the left or you know in progressive circles is that there's a real effort thing to create something that only really has an impact if it doesn't effort it you know so that coming within means that you're you you know you're owning your stuff you are connected to yourself and your compassion and your inclusivity emerges naturally because that's how you are you can't help being like that when the ego is trying to mimic that it's exactly that it goes into well authoritarianism at the worst and at least a lot of bullying and kind of snide Ness on the other end and so again that's that's part of a necessity for me of this kind of shadow work and also just recontextualizing focusing on the individual it's not a selfish thing it is kind of a selfish thing but it will lead you to a selfless place it's so good so first I mean this is the pendulum right we're talking about different ways pendulum swings and I think you're absolutely right that idea that you know it's kind of like and it's helman to saying we need to get out of the consulting-room into the world but there's been a move you know there's like either it's all self work everyone's in therapy for themselves it's all about what's going on with me no one's being active no one's going on to the world trying to help change systems of oppression you might have a person of color sitting in a therapy office and they're saying oh well your anxiety or your depression is connected to what your mother's did your father did and you're not talking about the system's level of oppression or violence but then you also have this real strong swing towards tackling the systems and the systemic inequality and injustice and collective you have activists who are not only burning out getting different forms of PTSD but are also not doing the inner work around their own personal trauma and healing work that needs to happen and I'm always interested in this in this intersection of personal trauma and collective trauma and when are you speaking about one form but it's coming out another way and I think there are a lot of people who are fighting beautifully for important of Justice inequality who might be charged and really angry because they have undigested unprocessed and healed personal trauma however that could look there's not to deny that collective they're fighting on bit and on the behalf of a group of a marginalized and oppressed group but there's no language or container to talk about like whoa now it feels like you're talking about a systemic issue but it's coming from a very deep low place of PTSD and trauma I saw a Twitter bio yesterday that was kind of activists all angry like the the fetishization of anger it's a real thing that on the left it's like well you should be angry look at the way the world is it's like that doesn't seem a very ground a place to make the changes we need to we need to make right you know this relationship between the individual and the community or society is it's a dialectical one it's it's recursive it's a loop right because it's not like we just come into the world as responsible free thinking individuals a certain kind of community is necessary that values those things and instills them and culture it's that and young people so if human beings don't come into a situation wherein there's equal opportunity for quality housing you live in a good neighborhood they go to a good school they have good food if they don't have get this equal opportunity they're not gonna be able to become individuals so you already it's it's it's a loop right it's a chicken and the egg problem if you don't have the kind of society that values you know early childhood and early education as the platform upon which you then get free thinking responsible individuals you're not gonna get those as adults and so but at the same time you're not gonna have that kind of society unless you have free thinking responsible adults to invest in creating it and maintaining it so where do we start it's like there's we have in our work to do and there's political yeah and it's kind of like clean your room and maybe we should also acknowledge it some people's rooms are just two walls with no ceiling on it and it's like they're trying to clean it with hurricanes and rain that is important to remember I think it's a yes ad certainly right but it's gotta start somewhere my my own feeling is it's got a there's got to be an acknowledgment that of course begun have equal opportunity right now but we have to start somewhere because I've noticed this and you know activist communities as well trying to change an entire system yeah where it is where do you start start with the people in the system it's not perfect but there seems to be a kind of mismatch between actually superior talks about this as well it's like if you say something is systemic then it's it's almost so big there's like what the hell are you gonna do you know so at least focusing even in that model on individual institutions like this institution is corrupt I'm gonna focus with ten other people or individual actions or individual actions within those institutions you know it's got to narrow down to a degree otherwise it's completely unmanageable yeah I started to get this feeling during the Occupy protests in 2011 or so where all these people are out there protesting I felt energized by it but there was no sense of directing that energy into specific policy goals or initiatives yeah and I got to realizing like we're all railing against capitalism it's like well it's so big it's such an abstraction where's capitalism where's capitalism and we're out there in front of these huge bank buildings protesting and I realized that you know I thought any minute those executives at the top floor we're gonna realize like okay push the emergency button you cashed out of the ATM is on the streets and will disperse the people immediately yeah and because capitalism it's inside of all of us when we see money we're like we've become money grubbers and so it's like where's the enemy really if we're fighting against something that's systemic you know it's not separate from you and it shifts the anger from being just directed outward to a different kind of emotion that's maybe like maybe just as urgent but more curious like okay this is something I need to exercise from this self as much as from anyone else sure and to Peterson's point about that kind of medium resolution grand narrative yeah the necessity of EPs I was at Occupy London when all the police came with the horses and we were all standing there I had thought I was like hmm I wanted to die for this and then I was like you guys really sorry for like what are we willing to die for because that is the kind of energy that actually does change systems yes when it's like and unfortunate it often happens when pea in such a horrible position that it's like well yeah that death could be preferable to my life but finding that you know the reintroduction of meta-narrative in a new way for me is so essential because it's like what can we all get behind butts currently we still don't really have that what can we all agree on is worth living for and dying for yeah that's also where Pearson's you know one of his critiques and challenges which is hard to hear from the left is he brings back that old and charged word of responsibility personal responsibility and where is that in these conversations and it's really provocative to try and grapple with but to the point about a low-resolution grand narrative you know clearly are fighting on behalf of the systemic impressions and and certain oppressed peoples but then it's like use this phrase out in one pot or interview and he was like he was talking I think about the Christian Church she was like well a certain boy you should have and say this is my cross to bear and this radical mystery that we're in as human beings is we're all show up and we all have our forms of suffering it can look a million different ways and some there's some archetypal the truths and level that speech to like we each have a cross I have my own cross I know it really well I've been in therapy a long time I'm working on my shadow but I don't know you know what it's like to be a person of color or there's so many different ways but if we forget that truth there is some mystery in which we're all here on earth and we're trying to carry what's ours act in the world and help others and be a locus of sanity and kindness and goodness in this world maybe that's the trick yeah individuality is the highest value but your individuality is a gift it doesn't belong to you in the sense that on the one hand UK if you're religious God gave you your individuality of your secular society instilled any of those values raised you to be capable of that mmm-hmm once we start thinking that I belong to myself I think we get into poverty and without an overarching grand low-resolution grand narrative about that meaning me is the only me yes me is the only thing left that's what everything gets relativized and culturally constructed there was a great line in the Camille Paglia Jordan Peterson talk where I think she said something like the sixties that consciousness is primary and a lot of the time that the left makes the mistake of thinking identity as primary is actually the thing that goes beyond identity that's primary that the the revelation of the 60s and of young is that consciousness the thing that transcends our current situation is the thing that's primary yeah that was a and that was kind of the revolution of the 60s I guess sparked by psychedelics and sparked by kind of the realization of why our consciousness is so much bigger than we ever realized and that's maybe the sort of transcendent value that we need to kind of recover yeah and it's like a capital C consciousness that doesn't exclude the body in a physical world that somehow the body in the physical world or manifestations or expressions of this big you know capital C consciousness right mm-hmm well I don't think Camille Paglia was talking about something that's stuck in the skull you know well it was young or someone I can't remember who talked about individuation as the move from the center of gravity being the ego or the s the self with a small ass to the self or the capital S that move of your center of gravity your identity from small s s self to large as self is a profound move and that that like without that move it's is that it's like you get what I would say I'm out to a kind of socialist value system but from the inside out rather than being imposed by an authoritarian government hmm hmm you must do this way be this way you must give this much in tax whatever it's more intrinsically motivated yeah you know and that's that's the shift that I think I'm looking for do we you know we had this thought the other day it's like the word should there's a lot of shoots especially on the left and it's like should is a very interesting word and it's a very interesting kind of state to be in whereas actually it what we're saying is we we can get to a place where it's not a should like a morality doesn't come from a place of should it comes from a place of genuine desire to do the things that we do and the left has started as a kind of resistance to the shoots of the of the 50s and 60s as a counterculture but it's become its own yeah yeah I guess in the Uni in terms it's or kind of Campbell mythic journey terms it's like when because we're kind of talking for those risk of an ego self confusion you know the ego becomes confused with the self and it's this kind of deep narcissism and it's more of a when the ego takes its natural place contained within the self then you should there's no should you will you will behave in a certain way and that that's kind of the back at the point I was making of this this desire for things to be a certain way and should be that way and should maybe be forced to be that way that's that's some of where authoritarianism comes from on both sides actually instead of this when we reach a certain level of understanding within ourselves and as a community we will behave in a certain way we will behave this way and it's a you know it's a tricky one it's a tricky one to get to but it's very convincing the ego can be very convincing mm-hmm I was not going to say because I don't know it I just had heard Brett Weinstein in conversation it might have been under Rogen it might've been with his brother Eric on the Rubin show but when they talk about game theories and they're talking about like these valleys and Peaks and he talked about it's a game B or I don't remember the name less something talked about this Archer who has become well-known or he has seized youtubes that are and he's apparently broken all the rules of classical traditional archery I wish I could members name where I'm kind of butchering this but I watched I looked him up and I watched it and it's like Tour sensibility it looks sloppy it's nothing it's nothing like the way we will see archery today but of course the argument is that this is how people in indigenous cultures and and they could shoot three at a time or shoot rapidly and hit targets and be effective in warfare we're not but anyway his point in bringing that up was that in this question of what's now what's emerging what is how do we move forward that he's saying it's almost like you you're in the system you're in the system until there's kind of a spontaneous leap and step out of that and you kind of step completely out no one sees it coming it's it's a phase shift it's like there's enough there's enough that's evolved and you hit a tipping point and it's a phase shift and so I've just kind of been meditating and ruminating on that like it might not be what we're thinking we're thinking in these ways and something might come completely from left field and that's what I like about the intellectual dark web especially Brad Weinstein and Jamie wheel and Eric and some of these others is they're really remaining open let's not let's make sure we don't think we know everything there's an interesting and I think it's probably the biggest split within the intellectual dark web because you've got people like Steven Pinker in it who are like these kind of very Pangloss Ian they're worried everything's great the world is getting better every worried about and even you saw that on the recent podcast with Shapiro wine Erik Weinstein and Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin Eric Weiss I was the only one saying hang on I don't think you're right I think I think things are getting existential II more dangerous even though you track kind of wealth or whatever and everything's getting better the risks are so much worse and we're kind of screwed and most of the the guys who I know I really respect like the Daniel Shmack Tim burgers Jordan green Hall Eric and Brett Weinstein are all like waving red flags and saying how on the existential risks are so huge the technology is so much better that we're in we're in a really difficult situation but also we talked to Daniel Shmack Tim burger and he used that phrase the phase shift he said we'll look at you can look at all of these indicators and see wow this is this is all getting very dangerous very difficult they're hardwired tribalism is likely to kill us and when all these things are are true but if you looked at he uses an example of a pregnant mother the babe nine months it would look like the baby was about to die because you don't know there's a phase shift about to happen and that's how he's choosing to see it as these are the birth pangs were something new and we don't know thing we don't know that there could very easily be a phase shift that were that we're going through into a completely new phase yeah yeah and I feel like the best between you right now is trying to cultivate a sensitivity a heightened sensitivity to possibility so that when that new thing that's gonna get us through this bottleneck appears we see it we feel it and it's not gonna look like what we're used to imagining as the solution and you know as we've said the solutions of the past that have been fought for once that group fighting for it wins you end up with a system worse than the one you just destroyed right so it's not gonna look like what we're used to looking for them how do we cultivate that sense of imagination that's required John Keats called it negative capability you can think about what's not yet actualized and hold yourself in that space of tension mm-hmm so that when that phase shift is ready to happen you can jump to the next chip that's gonna take us into the future I heard someone use the metaphor of like a baby bird in the shell and the egg and that there's some release of a gas or some something that happens in the birds suddenly after resting there says I need to get out and it just doesn't even know what it's doing it starts pecking and it's fracturing this encasing shell and then it just emerges into that next stage it feels there's some resonance in that kind of metaphor yeah so it's I think in one sense we're things are really bad right now and like just to give Steven Pinker a little bit of a nod like there's the potential for something great like with the technology that we have mm-hmm with a different social organization like we don't have a production problem we have a distribution problem it's one way I've heard it phrased in terms of there are so so many hungry people isn't that we have plenty of food so we just need a new way a new way of thinking with the technology that we have we could do something certain yeah William Gibson who says the future is here but it's not widely distributed okay that's good great thank you guys that's really great as a blast thanks so much for having us [Music] you
