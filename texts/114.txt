[Music] in a leafy suburb of Toronto lives one of the world's most controversial thinkers Thank You Jordan okay psychology professor Jordan Peterson caused a storm in late 2016 with a couple of YouTube videos about changes to the law in Canada around gender pronouns you came in from where I came in from London last night this University campus became a battleground like if I asked you would you please news daytime runners for me what what it would depend on what hoops do you want us to jump for those are my pronouns those there's no motivation no I know no one ever has his opponents accused him of being transphobic many others rallied to support him his job was threatened he refused to back down he claimed a new law pushed forward an authoritarian political agenda I was being asked as everyone is to use a certain set of words that I think are the constructions of people who have a political ideology that I don't believe in and that I also regard is as dangerous to me they're there they're there an attempt to control language and in a direction that isn't happening organically it's not happening naturally but by force and by Fiat and I would say by force because there's legislative power behind them so like these made-up words Z and xur and that sort of thing what about the Petersons this wasn't really about pronouns this was a surface reflection of a much deeper crisis the legislation itself and the policies were signifying a crisis a disjunction in Western society that was was far of which the gender pronoun argument was only a tiny tendril I put my finger on a nerve as time passed many of those who flocked to his videos for an attack on political correctness became hooked by his message of transformation and transcendence and began calling him one of the most profound thinkers of the time as a journalist and filmmaker of a TV networks like channel 4 in the BBC I'm trained to be skeptical of these kind of grand claims but over the last few months of listening to his lectures I become convinced that what he is saying is that significant which is why I've come all the way to Toronto to interview him Peterson has been studying belief systems his whole life and how the most utopian ideas can create the worst outcomes and he's concluded that only appreciation and integration of the great ideas of the past would protect us from the same things happening again I've always been surprised that I've been able to teach what I've been teaching in the universities because I've always regarded it as crazily radical in a sense you know it's crazily radical in a conservative way well I don't know what to make of that your teaching is crazy radical in a conservative way yeah I mean it's in a conservative way because I think that the past is not only has value its we cannot live without the integration of the past no more than you can live as an individual without integrating your past I mean we're historical creatures right and and we without if we're not united can't consciously with the past then were divided internally and socially and that has consequences so some of them are playing it themselves so in the political divisions in the current world but the consequences can be fatal his fascination with the nature of belief system started when he was a young man haunted by the threat of nuclear annihilation during the Cold War I was trying to solve this terrible puzzle that confronted me for and many other people about how it was that human beings got themselves in such a tangle about what they believed such a tangle that we were pointing the ultimate weapons of destruction at one another which by the way we are still doing and I thought okay well I understand that we need their belief systems they orient us and that means there will be conflict between belief systems and that can be a catastrophe and that's being played out everywhere again in very many ways what's the solution to that well one possibility is there's no solution it's just mayhem all the way around could be the case but it seemed to me as I delved into it that the proper solution to that was to live properly he believes the answers for how to live properly are all around us if we look carefully the artists get there before the philosophers long before the philosophers the dramatists get there way before the artists even and so we've figured it out we represented it in art and literature and music and drama and then we're on the cusp so to speak of understanding it in a fully articulated manner and not a moment too soon so what is that idea basically that there's a hidden story of transformation and transcendence and it's encoded in a mythology in our religion in our biology and in our actions Petersen is reviving the thought of Carl Jung the renegade psychologist who delve deeply into the human subconscious to develop the theory of archetypes Universal patterns of being such as the Divine Mother shared by all in the collective unconscious the way it looks to me is that we embody a lot of information in our action and our action has developed as a consequence of imitating other people and not only the people the people around us but of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them and those people in metate the people who came before them and so on so far back that it's as far back as you can go and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are extremely informative that you don't understand that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries and then those patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those figures of imagination are the distillation zuv patterns of behavior and so as the distillation zuv patterns of behavior they have content and it's not you that content it's you could even think about it as content that's evolved although it's culturally transmitted it's content that's evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you and that's what happened with Jung and that's what he described in the red book and that was what permeated his psychology a psychology that was based on the presupposition that the fundamental archetypal structures of religious belief were not pathological not deceitful not protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death but quite the contrary the very stories that enabled us to move forward as confident human beings in the face of chaos itself and it's conceivable I think perhaps probable that nothing more important conceptually happened in the 20th century than that because it was the first time post enlightenment that a rapprochement between the intellect and the underlying religious archetypal sub structure occurred you have in the capacious intellect of Jung and the same thing happened to some degree with Piaget the religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and the fact of Jung's enduring and increasing popularity and influence I would say is a direct consequence of that Peterson is reviving young and grounding his discoveries in the latest neuroscience explaining how these mythological archetypes are encoded in our brains and bodies tying together mythology psychology morality and religion with science you're adrift without it you have to you have to have a conscious relationship with the archetypes there's no way if you don't then you're susceptible to possession that's basically or to or to despair so and no wonder well you've got to have axioms so the run yeah seems are the archetypes yes that's where they exist you see a certain axis biological structures there at least that yeah they're preexisting they're pre-existing categories of perception in the Kantian sense that's a good way of thinking about it is that you know that the peer empiricist thinks that you get all your information from the outside world right but that's not true because you bring on a priori interpretive framework to the world and that's instantiated biologically but then it's also enculturated so separating the archetype from the underlying biological reality isn't easy so you have the snake you have the propensity to to perceive reptilian predators the manner in which those things are represented in the culture fill those holes essentially and so that can summarize the language instinct so yeah that's right exactly it's the same thing it's the same thing like the archetypes are manifestations of the universal grammar grammar of emotion and motivation that's a good way of thinking about it now they may be more than that these are some things we have to recover these timeless truths but most of all the idea of transcendental truth itself the logos it's the idea of the logos most means something like coherent interpersonal communication of the truth it's the action of the logos that extracts order from chaos will not survive without it the West will die without the rebirth of the logos because the West is that so without gone it's gone and we've seen what's arisen to replace it while there's fascism there's communism and then there's the New Age mess because it's a mess and most of its wish fulfillment and fantasy and inability to there's creativity in it but there's no capacity to edit whatsoever there's no coherence and so that's stuff so weak that anyone with any commitment can just push it aside and there's no justification for the for the Marxism and or for the fascism it's like we already had that experiment could you describe what you mean by the rebirth of the logos then in that context well it's it's the it's part of it is taking taking voluntary responsibility for the appalling conditions of your life essentially that you're a suffering creature that's mortal right and that you're the locus of evil both of those things and that it's your response that your life is about responsibility and it's your responsibility to voluntarily accept that and then to do what you can about it even though it's in some sense you know it's an enterprise doomed to failure in some sense because you're going to die and and and the world is a carnage a place of carnage but that that you can accept that and if you can't accept it then what that means is that you're not integrated enough because if your integrated enough then you can accept it it's it's like the test of the integration so your your character isn't forged sufficiently if you cannot tolerate that and it's not like it's an easy thing to tolerate often what people do is they just don't think about it they just push it out of their mind and no wonder but they pay for that with shallowness and with self contempt and with with the inability to bear suffering nobly let's say there's a call to nobility in the in the idea of imitation of the logos but it's more than that it's a call to something of well the hypothesis is it's a call to something of cosmic significance and I don't think that we have any right to assume that that idea is wrong we don't understand our place in the cosmos and you know if you if you base your analysis on size physical size well there are bigger things than us but it's not-- that's no that's not a reasonable yardstick there isn't anything that's more complex than us not not that we know of so why not use that as an as a marker Peterson is often characterized as a religious conservative but the core of his message has echoes of a radical belief that organized Christianity has fought against for generations often called the Gnostic heresy the idea that we can become like Jesus you know the question is what happens to the world around you as you embark as you increasingly embody the logos and the answer to that is we don't know we don't know what the ultimate level of this now the hypothesis is and it's a hypothesis that extends to some degree to Buddha as well the hypothesis is that there has been one or two individuals who managed that and that in their management of that they transcended death itself I don't know what happens to a person if they bring themselves completely into alignment I've had intimations of what that might mean we don't understand the world very well we don't understand how the world could be mastered if it was mastered completely we don't know how an individual might be able to manage that we don't know what transformations that might make possible there's a few quotes that you that I've transcribed that from the ideology logos and belief lecture which I remember having a kind of hair stand up on the back of my neck moment when I heard you say this I don't know what happens to a person if they bring themselves completely into alignment I've had intimations of what that might mean that's that's mysticism rather than religion is it not well I don't know if you can you could draw a distinction between those two things to some degree because you could say that in a religious system there's two components and people are temperamentally inclined to align with one or the other there's a dogmatic component so the Conservatives are more likely to align with that and there's a active mystical component which updates the conservative component but also threatens it so which is what creative thought does in general and so I would say that the mystical element of that is religious but it's more on the transformative side but you know I also think that figures like the Buddha you know he's an exemplar of the possibilities of that alignment and the exercise is the yogic exercises for example our attempts to bring that alignment into being you know I mean it's very centered on the body which is quite interesting even though it's a spiritual tradition right very very centered on the body and when you say you have intimations of what that might mean can you explain what you mean by that well I've had experiences where everything came together you know and and and there are very very powerful experiences and and they're they're also characterized by it's like everything turns into a musical symphony where each part is exactly appropriate for that moment and and I think music actually expresses that which is partly why music produces transcendent experiences you know when people are dancing to something profound and they're really into it let's say the music and the person are the same thing and then if if things really get going you see this sometimes in a rock concert or a musical concert where everyone is in the same place right the band kicks into high gear and they're way out beyond where they usually go you don't see that that often in a concert even a great concert but now and then you really see it and the whole place is one thing that's just pulsing you know and that's an amazing experience and I think it is an intimation of paradise it's something like that and you can think about that psychologically you know because it also makes sense psychologically that we're at our best when we're integrated completely and there is an effect of that integration in principle on what we would normally regard as external reality because external reality can line up with that integration as well and so-called external reality and I think people probably experience that when they have peak sexual experiences with someone you know where there's real intimacy because they're in the same place at the same time and everything comes together for that moment you know maybe literally yes yes literally right and and and I also don't think that that linguistic usage is chance right because I think that's a place where that experience is a brief intimation of of heaven that might be way of thinking about it so this message of responsibility and meaning is resonating most deeply with men every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly men it's like it's like eighty-five to ninety percent and so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly and then the other thing I've noticed is that I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights but about responsibility right because he can't have the bloody converse what are you doing you can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion and we're only having half that discussion and the question is well what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is well you're leaving out responsibility and then the question is well what are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life that's what it looks like to me it's like here you are suffering away what makes it worthwhile right you know you're completely oh you're completely you have no idea what you're you it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is responsibility that's what gives life meaning it's like lift a load then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless easily hurt easily killed why should you have any self-respect that's the story of the fall pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well what's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light up and that's very like I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light out because I put something together for them that's what mythological stories do so I'm not taking responsibility for that that's what the stories do so I save the story people go click click click you know in their eyes light up but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that it is unbelievable it just blows me away it's like really that's what's that's the counterculture grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh I'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it's like rights rights rights rights Jesus it's it's it's appalling it's a it's and and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to to listen to these sorts of things to there they've had enough of that so and they better have because it's it's a non-productive mode of being responsibility man I think it's because in a deep level the West has lost faith in the idea of masculinity now that's no different than the death of God it's the same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be I mean that's most of what he wrote about you know and so you'd say well the divine symbol of masculinity has been obliterated well so then what do you expect what it what's gonna happen it's gonna that means masculinity is going to become weak and especially if the symbol is also denigrated right which it definitely is so what that means is that the ideal that man could aspire to is denigrated and well then with your ideal in tatters you're weak that's that's definitional so I think the reason that men have been responding positively to my my thinking let's say is that I don't buy any of that I like the masculine spirit it's necessary and it's not fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's not fundamentally rape culture you know it's not fundamentally world destroying and all of those things have been all of those aspersions have been cast upon that's partly the guilt of Western society for technological progress even and those are reasonable challenges to be set before men but they're not reasonable accusations to swallow without criticism and and it's not that what is it what what is the masculinity we can aspire to well it's a responsibility fundamentally and it's it's it's to put it symbolically is that your your responsibility is to incarnate the Spirit of the logos that's your responsibility that's your role in life and that is independent to some degree in whether or not you accept the idea of a transcendent and eternal reality now I'm not making a case for that or against that I those things are beyond human understanding but we know what happens if people act poorly if men act badly we know what happens we know that the world turns into something that's so close to held that the difference is trivial we know that that's the story of the 20th century so we should learn that lesson and what that lesson is is pick up the world on your shoulders and walk forward pick up the world with all of its trouble with all of its suffering with all of its evil and move forward with it and in bearing that burden learn that you're the sort of creature that can bear that burden and therefore deserving of respect that's that's the that's identification with the logos and that's I don't I've never encountered an idea that's better than that because it's not it's so not naive it's the opposite of naive it's like there's terrible evil and there's terrible suffering it's bottomless but the human spirit is capable of voluntarily taking that on as a challenge well it's worth a try he believes this deep evolved truth is under attack by a timeless resentment relativism and cynicism under the modern guise of the philosophy of post-modernism people don't understand that post-modernism is a complete assault on two things one it's an assault on the metaphysical substrate of our culture and I would say that the metaphysical substrate looks something like a religious substrate so it's a direct assault on that and the second thing it's an assault on is everything that's been established since the Enlightenment rationality empiricism science everything clarity of mind dialogue the idea of the individual all of that is is normally you see it's not only that it's up for grabs that's not the thing it's to be destroyed he believes that post-modernism was the hidden motivation for the pronoun war and is an attack on the core structures of being itself I assume that you're skeptical of the idea of the description of gender as a spectrum no I'm suspicious of the motives for for putting that idea forward and and I also think it's it's it's an imprecise definition it's not a spectrum because a spectrum is equally represented at each point in the distribution so that's wrong and it and the it's wrong in the way that you would expect it to be wrong given its ideological basis now you know there's male and female and masculine and feminine are not exactly the same thing and so and that's a reasonable claim and you could also make a case that too much masculinity without an admixture of femininity is a form of excess and that too much femininity without an admixture of masculinity is an X isn't is excess you know or is a is a is a failure it's it's it's it's an extreme but the obliteration of the distinction between male and female or masculine and feminine is a it's a psychological catastrophe not least because those are arguably the most basic cognitive axioms they're deeper than that they're they're axioms on which our entire cognitive structures is predicated and yin-yang yes exactly exactly exactly well and I think that that's a consequence of our biological heritage like the reality of sex sex is very very very old it's a fundamental issue and sex is fundamentally about female and male and there's no getting around that now as I said you can distinguish masculine and feminine from that and you can speak about the psychological components of sex as well as the physiological components but the real radicals deny the physiological components it's like that's okay except when they force other people to do the same kind of denial like people are entitled to their opinion but they're not entitled to put it in the law and so that's why I was opposed to not to transgender rights or to transgender people or I mean it's that's a sideshow in in many ways I'm not trying to trivialize it but it's not like a it's not the main event it's emblematic of something else otherwise no one would have cared and I just see it as fundamentally oriented towards destabilization and destruction he says to defend ourselves against resentment we each need to identify it in ourselves our shadows and that's partly why young believed that it was necessary for people to integrate their shadow and he said that was a terrible thing for people to attempt because the human shadow mmm which is all those things about yourself that you don't want to realize reaches all the way to hell and what he meant by that was it's through an analysis of your own shadow that you can come to understand why other people are capable and you as well of the sorts of terrible atrocities that characterize let's say the 20th century and without that understanding there's no possibility of bringing it under control when you study Nazi Germany for example or you study the Soviet Union particularly under Stalin and you're asking yourself well what are these perpetrators like forget about the victims let's talk about the perpetrators the answer is they're just like you and if you don't know that that just means that you don't know anything about people including yourself and then it also means that you have to discover why they're just like you and believe me that's no picnic so that's enough to traumatize people and that's partly why they don't do it and it's also partly why the path to enlightenment and wisdom is seldom trod upon because if it was all a matter of following your bliss and doing what made you happy then everyone in the world would be a paragon of wisdom but it's not that at all it's the it's a matter of facing the thing you least want to face while through listening to it started to make sense of a lot of what I've been doing over the last few years I've done quite a lot of sort of deep transformational practices a lot of shadow works of integrating the shadow and actually feeling that real sense of becoming more in alignment with myself feeling that these different parts of myself coming together and feeling more embodied and more present in the world but it was through listening to you that I made this connection with the logos with the idea that this is actually a deep principle of Western culture which gave it another it's it's the principle of the Incarnation right because the Incarnation is is as at least a symbolic representation of the idea that the Spirit has to fully inhabit the body right and that's also a remarkable it's a remarkable idea especially because the spirit so to speak the psyche if you want flees from the body in terror because the body is the place of mortality and suffering and so people are disembodied and it's because what one way of looking at is because they're too afraid to become fully embodied and it's no wonder they're afraid there's reason to be afraid but the question is well what would you be like if you had the courage to be fully embodied and that's fully incarnate that's another way of thinking about that and the idea that Christian ideas that the fully incarnate human being is the Messiah that's the idea that's a hell of an idea you know but it means embracing the horrors of the world that's what it means and that's not only the horrors of the world but the evil of the world you know so there's this idea that Christ absolutely well then those are those are not different and you know there's this idea that not only was Christ the Incarnate spirit right so fully descended into the body let's say but that he also took the sins of the world onto himself and what that means is that psychologically speaking is that part of spiritual development is to recognize the satanic tendencies that characterize you and to fully wrestle with them and to and to integrate them that's the thing it's it's not so much to cast them away it's to transmute them you know and you can see the difference between people who've done that and people who haven't at least to some degree because people who haven't integrated the shadow at all are naive and you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them and because they're naive they're often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of and someone who's integrated that more they're dangerous in in the martial arts sort of way which is they're dangerous but they don't have to be they don't have to use it because their presence radiates what would you say it doesn't radiate threat exactly well certainly strength but it's it's it's it's the potential for havoc that's the right way of thinking about it there's a there's an implicit potential for havoc and that's really necessary it's one of the things that gives people self respect this is an interesting thing about the integration of the shadow because recognizing yourself as the locus of evil let's say actually in some sense gives you far more respect for yourself strangely enough because the same respect that you might have for a wild animal or even a monster it's like and though so then maybe you learn to treat yourself differently like I think this is particularly true with regards to the discipline of children you know if you know that you're a monster and that that will manifest itself in your life consciously or unconsciously and if it's unconsciously it's it's it's not good then you become better at disciplining children and the reason for that is that you don't want to expose them to your dark side and so if they behave and don't provoke you which means they'll also behave for other people then you don't the monstrous part can stay in abeyance and then that's great but if you don't understand yourself as capable of wreaking havoc and that can be the kind of havoc that unfolds over decades right because if you're going to abuse a child it's the primitive form of abuse is the physical abuse the sophisticated form of abuse is the continual undermining of the child's courage across perhaps their entire life and that there's a terribly monstrous element to that and if you're not respected properly by the child say you will absolutely take revenge on them and you know that's the holes in some sense that's the whole Freudian psychoanalytic story it's not all of it but it's a huge part of it interesting that you you say that you have to accept the fact that you're dangerous or become dangerous because I'd also say that if you haven't done that kind of shadow work if you haven't made friends with your anger if you haven't integrated it your actually more dangerous yes then things will happen that will it will come out in a way that you don't expect right it comes out disintegrate it so it comes out as an autonomous spirit right under no-one's control and that's like a burst of rage let's say you either have that or it has you those are the options and you don't become safe by being castrated right that's not the right move forward you can actually see a change in people's faces when that part of them is integrated when the I would say the rage circuit is integrated because their face is hardened like they no longer look like wide-eyed children that they're no longer someone to whom things only happen there there's someone who makes things happen and there isn't much difference between being dangerous and being indomitable right there.this they're that they're they're the same thing looked at from two different perspectives and so you know in my new book I wrote a little bit about there was an idea in the 80s that was reasonably popular among psychologists that the way to regulate male aggression was to socialize little boys like little girls and that's a very very bad idea so because suppressing that aggressive competitive urge which also characterized as many women by the way although it's more common among men it that isn't what you do you you you integrate it this is why I'm such a fan of Piaget you know as opposed not as opposed to Freud but I think Piaget is developmental model is superior to Freud's developmental model because for Piaget the process of becoming civilized is a process of continual integration including the integration of what Freud would consider the in you know I mean it's not as if for I didn't know that because he wanted people to incorporate the it but he you know he kind of conceptualized socialization as the super-ego inhibiting the it'd you know or or suppressing it that's only that only happens when the socialization process is bad when it's good like if you have a competitive child like my son was was and is a competitive person you have them integrate that into the ethos of fair play and then it's it's a mark of character strength at that point and absolutely there's there's no doubt about it the Petersons the shadow work is another process of embodying the logos in our own lives by speaking the truth if you listen to yourself talk you can tell when when you're speaking properly you will experience a feeling of integration and strength and when you're speaking in a deceitful or a manipulative manner you'll feel that you're starting to come apart at the seams and what you need to do is practice only saying things that make you feel stronger the truth is something that burns it burns off Deadwood and people don't like having their Deadwood burnt off often because they're like 95% Deadwood and I'm not being don't believe me I'm not being snide about that it's no joke when you start to realize how much of what you've constructed of yourself is based on deception and lies that is a horrifying realization and it can easily be 95% of you get your things you say things you act out many describe how listening to them is a process of integrating things they knew but didn't know that they knew that's another hallmark of truth is that it snaps things together and people write to me all the time and say that it's like it's a it's it's as if things were coming together in my mind it's like well that's what archetypes do archetypes glue things together so yes it's it's the proper expression of unconscious being teaches people what they already know it's it's kind of like the Platonic idea that all learning was remembering it's right it's it's it you know in it it's it's not right exactly the way that we would think of learning and remembering now but you you have a you have a you have a nature and when you feel that nature articulated it's it's like the act of snapping the puzzle pieces together they're right there that's the that's the that's the the bringing the levels of being in to sink into sinker that's what you feel it's like oh that's synchronized now it's like what I think and the way I feel have come together and you feel that snap it's like oh that's a simpler it's a simpler state it's something like that it's not rife with contradictions anymore since he came to public attention Peterson has been doing the seemingly impossible convincing hardened atheists of the value of religion he's a scientist but not a materialist and criticizes the likes of Richard Dawkins Sam Harris this is why I have such frustration say with people like Sam Harris this sort of radical atheists because they seem to think that once human beings abandoned their their grounding in the transcendent that the the plausible way forward is with a kind of purist rationality that automatically attributes to other people equivalent value it's like I just don't understand that they believe that that's the rational pathway what the hell is irrational about me getting exactly what I want from every one of you whenever I want it at every possible second why is that irrational and how possibly is that more irrational than us cooperating so we can both have a good time of it I don't understand that I mean it's as if the the psychopathic tendency is irrational there's nothing irrational about it it's pure naked self-interest how is that irrational I don't understand that where where's the pathway from rationality to to an egalitarian virtue why the hell not every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost it's a perfectly coherent philosophy and it's actually one that you can Institute in the world with a fair bit of material success if you want to do it so I don't understa Dawkins and Harris I inhabit is so intensely conditioned by mythological presuppositions that they take for granted the ethic that emerges out of that as if it's just a given a rational given and this of course precisely ditch his observation as well Dostoyevsky's that's Nietzsche's observation you don't get it the ethic that you think is normative is a consequence of its of its root of its nesting inside this tremendously lengthy history much of which was expressed in mythological formulation you wipe that out you don't get to keep all the presuppositions and just assume that they're rationally axiomatic they're the rational to make a rational argument you have to start with an initial proposition well the proposition that underlies Western culture is that there's a transcendent morality now you could say that's a transcendent morality and Stan she ated in the figure of God that's fine you could even call that a personification of the morality if you want to if you if you don't want to move into a metaphysical space I'm not arguing for the existence of God I'm arguing that the ethic that drives our culture is predicated on the idea of God and that you can't just take that idea away and expect the thing to remain intact midair without any foundational support for Peterson wisdom emerges from a much deeper place than the rational intellect I don't consider myself an intellectual precisely what yourself see because my ideas aren't disembodied I act them out but to be any less romantic in some sense well I don't live in my head exactly many of the prominent intellectual types have become prisoners of their own imagination you know it's and this is partly what breeds that that terror of intellectualism there's there's something there's something about it that's we don't want to get too far away from our bodies we don't want to get too far away from our souls that's another way of thinking about it and you know there there is this idea that as I said before that the Catholics always warned about is that the rational mind falls in love with its own productions or even more that it tries to elevate its productions to the status of God what are the prerequisites for true knowledge and understanding because it seems to me this intelligence is only a small matter of seeing an understanding property and it takes a certain amount of moral courage it's takes a certain amount of having done the work of introspection having done the work of deep introspection what do you think the the components are for true knowledge and understanding well I think I think the motivation one of the best motivations is existential terror you know I mean I don't remember where this is in the Old Testament but the line is the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and that's definitely psychologically true but but we could strip it say of its transcendent implications and say well if for me anyways I wasn't motivated to be serious until I knew what I was capable of in the most negative way because you don't take yourself seriously until you know that you can be you are an evil monster and you don't take that seriously until you know what that means and so but once you know what that means especially if you do it if you find that out consciously say then you're in a position to start taking yourself seriously enough so that you might be willing to learn what you need to learn to become wise you have to see yourself as an Auschwitz camp guard and you have to see yourself enjoying it and that can't just be an exercise in intellectual simulation precisely it has to be a dramatic experience you have to feel that in your bones and then you have to decide and you have to give the devil is do there's something very attractive about predatory power and you might even say that it's preferable to pathetic weakness now I'm not saying that but you could make a case that it is because you could say that the person who's pathetically weak would like to be a predatory tyrant but just doesn't have the ability and that's well that's a Nietzsche and criticism of standard morality I would say but then is there something higher than predatory power well yes I mean part of part of Christ's encounter was Satan in the desert is precisely that realization because he's offered the kingdom of the world and and that means he's offered the option of tyrannical power and his response to that is there's something better and that's wisdom there is something better and there's no reason not to go for what is the best what else you don't have anything better to do than that by definition right so why not work for the betterment of being and abandon your resentment and your hatred of humanity and your self contempt and and take on the responsibilities of the horrors and and catastrophes of of human existence and do what you can to well at least not make it worse but maybe to make it better you know you can you know you can make it worse and better you just don't know how much find out it might be way more than you think I'm sure that's the case so there isn't any more an interesting adventure than that you know find out how much good you can do in the world and not in it and not in this moralistic thou shalt not way but in a forthright noble courageous eyes wide open articulate embodied manner and then God only knows where we could get so let's see let's find out that would be good it's certainly better than the alternative for the full 90 minute interview with jordan peterson and more
