[Music] what we wanted to do is give everyone a little bit of context into the speakers so Bret Weinstein and they're hiring here McGilchrist Jordan green hole a little bit of background to their thought as preparation for the summit and also talked a little bit about what the summit is and what it entails for you as a participant because it's not the regular kind of talk where we might go and listen to someone at the summit everyone's a participant and in a particular way which we're going to talk about in a bit more detail so rebel wisdom the media channel has existed for a bit over a year now and one of the things that many of the people we've interviewed have in common and certainly the four speakers who we have coming to the summit is this idea that we're in the middle of a sense making crisis and the the mission of rebel wisdom is very much how do we make sense of the sense making crisis if that's not to matter already and that sense making crisis takes many different forms and definitely a big part of that is this shift from broadcast to digital and also the kind of the increased polarization that we're definitely seeing through social media and this kind of feeling that we all have of being pushed and further and further into very ideological camps and how that's kind of increased and how it's much more difficult to have conversations across those divides and so a real world event is a really important part of how do we model those conversations those generative conversations and we'll talk a bit more about that and even there's sort of physiology of that kind of generative conversation later in this film but what's clearly necessary is that we are able to enter into generative dialogue with each other where we're not just broadcasting what we think at each other we are having a conversation that can build on itself and that's why we've invited the four people that we have to the summit because we we were very impressed with when we interviewed them and we know that they're able to enter into that space and so very quickly introducing them so firstly Bret Weinstein and Heather huiying Bret and Heather are both evolutionary biologists they're also husband and wife and they were both teaching in the same College Evergreen in the u.s. up until just over a year ago and famously and I say famous if you don't know their history and evergreen we're going to put a couple of links in the show notes below this that you can watch and get a bit of a background but they famously had this run-in with student activists in Evergreen and had to leave but what's really fascinating is that they were teaching evolutionary biology some of the most difficult hot-button topics right now in the media about sort of sex differences between men and women in one of the most progressive colleges in the country and so have a huge amount of experience of teaching tricky difficult topics in environments where that can be misinterpreted there are tremendous lessons and the key to what Heather and I were doing was that we started out by engineering a community that was safe to have discussions and discussions that were we to take what was said in our classroom and to import it into a faculty meeting would have caused a conflagration for sure but you have a group of students it's a question of broadening their worldview so that they can understand that all of the things that they know they care about all of the things that they find fun to do all of the pursuits that drive them their their loves their passions that all of these things are products of evolution and that means that understanding evolution provides a kind of roadmap against the inner confusion that's a very powerful incentive for people to embrace it so the answer to your question is you provide the safety to explore where people quickly get the idea that they are not going to be backed against the wall for saying something that sounds radical or off and then there's the incentive to have the conversation which comes from the fact that you get something positive for it you know to understand yourself to understand why people interact in the way they do is a very powerful advantage and if you're presented with the question of would you like to endure some discomfort in order to have the power to understand your own life almost everybody will say yes we were able to talk about difficult subjects pretty easily right we and you know in some ways it was what students were signing up for you know I didn't the two kinds of programs that I did most were vertebrate evolution which was not did not fear too much into politically dangerous territory but an will behavior is rife with it you know you can't you can't not go there if you want to do it honestly and so talking about and you know and humans are animals so we didn't we didn't fear from humans and in fact all of the seminars that I tend to do in those programs were specifically on humans on human evolution readings what our history has looked like mostly our prehistory and frankly students especially from historically marginalized and oppressed groups were particularly interested several several people told me nearly every year I thought this material but they're particularly interested to finally get a read on what it was that evolution had to say about about being gay or about different races or about especially any Oh in my case I would teach a lot on sex and gender and you know on what it was to be male versus female the next speaker we want to introduce is Ian McGilchrist who's definitely one of the most revolutionary and fascinating thinkers we've come across since you've been doing this so here's a psychiatrist and philosopher he wrote a book called the masters emissary where he really took a much wider view of the left-right brain split that we all have and looking not only at how it influences how we perceive reality but also how it might have influenced the development of culture as well and I think that is a really fascinating view on the sense-making crisis we are not aware that our reality is constructed by two different systems if you we focus on different aspects of reality and therefore construe a world with different qualities and the first part of the book explains that in terms of neuropsychiatry and philosophy and the second part of the book suggests that in the history of the West three times we have been in a position where to begin with a civilization flourished when it kept both these visions together that of the right hemisphere and that of the left but then in every case and I believe we're repeating the pattern for the third time as the the civilization overreached itself and things deteriorated and the mindset became more rigid more bureaucratic less imaginative less flexible less in touch with reality and became locked into a way of thinking which is that the left hemisphere which is useful it's not a mistake that we have it but it cannot be our way of contacting reality a simple way of putting it is it's like mistaking the map for the tariff we talk a lot on this channel about the meta conversation the idea that what we need is a conversation that opens up to the not knowing to what needs to emerge beyond and what it feels like is happening now increasingly with social media is people are getting stuck more and more in certainty and in what they do know is that a right-brain left-brain phenomena well it can be looked at in that way in that one of the features of the left hemisphere is that it prefers what it's already familiar with and it finds it very difficult to shift set so once it's stuck into something it keeps on repeating it so the left hemispheres take is an exclusive one either this is right or that is right and therefore what I know excludes what you know whereas the right hemispheres take is a both and to take that there's a room for what the left hemisphere does there's a point in analysis but there's also a point in synthesis and imagination and what we are desperately lacking is is that overall synthesis it seems to me that at the moment we officially pride ourselves on being a very free thinking people I'm going to sound like a terrible Friday Daddy but I think the intellectual world was far more open in the 60s and 70s when I grew up than it is today it's closed down to a number of dogmas and the Internet which is a wonderful thing hasn't helped because it's possible for people to get trapped in bubbles where they reinforce the things they believe Without Really hearing other points of view and last but not least is Jordan green Hall Jordan is kind of difficult to define I guess you probably call him a futurist writer he wrote a piece that went pretty viral after the Trump election called deep code situational assessment in which he basically kind of said this is what I think's going on with the Trump election and this is what's likely to happen next and he introduced a whole load of concepts that we found incredibly helpful to kind of make sense of the world the insurgency the the blue church and he talked a lot about how we're moving from like a broadcast modality in many different areas of life where one speaks and others listen to a networked digital modality and what that means for society and the idea of the blue church being this kind of this framework that had taken us through from probably the second world war on woods and was now breaking down and all of the media institutions and a lot of our kind of academic institutions are part of this blue church concept but if that's breaking down what happens and what's likely to happen next and it is certainly the case that in this in this moment in order to speak honestly requires courage and I was gonna say in particular when we have to say is not that which is in alignment with good opinion but oddly enough I think it's even when it is in a line with a good opinion because I think there's something in the ambient environment that feels honesty as a as a bad thing in and of itself I almost a a complicity to always be ever so slightly ironic and never be fully connected to trying to speak honestly but at the same time human beings have evolved in fact I won't even say it's the essence of what we are that differentiates us from our premia ancestors to be very very attracted to honest insightful expression oftentimes in history we've needed that something to make it and the situation was not easy the situation was complex challenging and so it required that something that whatever it is that happens when we are gathered together in a space of well collaboration let's just make it again very simple a space of peace a space of mutual understanding not for the purpose of delivering on the same opinion but really for going deep and trying to find something which is trying to frankly express itself like to listen and so if that story the story that is told is true then it would be in our bones it would be in our deepest mythology and our deepest traditions I do this religion that this is the place to go that when trouble is brewing gather together answer into this space this is where we do these sorts of things this is how we solve these kinds of problems so those are our four speakers and now we want to talk a little bit about what we're actually going to be doing at the summit and how we're going to be doing it which is probably more important we've been doing events like this for about a year now on a smaller scale so we evening events where we've had a speaker and then we've broken off into groups to discuss and really figure out how we feel about it personally and then be in a dialogue with one another and that there's been a real hunger for that and that's been very exciting to do so the summit is by far the biggest event we've done and we've capped it at 150 people and partly because we want to keep it intimate we want to have an environment where we really can get into dialogue with each other we're going to be breaking off into groups so a number higher than that is difficult to do that with it's also coincidentally the Dunbar number which is for an Oxford professor Robin Dunbar pointed out that a 150 people is about the amount where you can kind of have coherence within a group and beyond that it becomes more difficult to do that so we've always run retreats as well as the media side where we work with meditation and we work with kind of all of these ways of kind of hacking our physiology to get into these spaces and what I think is really if you look into that world what you see is a lot of understanding of overwhelm and how that puts us into either fee either we're in an exploratory mode towards the world or we're in a defensive mode and there's many different models that show that and we've actually got a film coming up work that we're working on at the moment which is about the physiology kind of the physiology of generative dialogue with Peter Levine who is a kind of a superstar in the world of of trauma and growth when our nervous system is in the sympathetic arousal state the fight or flight we will perceive the person there's no way we won't perceive the person as as an enemy as an adversary that's just the way we're wired and again the question is how we get from there to here here being social engagement you know one thing is important for me is is that we hold it lightly because in a sense we are all participating in an experiment at the summit and also that we kind of try our best to get into a space of what's called coherence together and I think it's interesting to hear Jordan green hall talk about what that word means so coherence is when people are able to enter in a relationship where they basically been to form an emergent whole as emergent properties that is greater than the individuals involved greater than the sum of the parts and to achieve coherence first and foremost requires both sovereignty and awareness of sovereignty I mean you you have it and you're aware where you are and a continual consciousness of recognizing that you have to maintain a certain level of sovereignty to be able to enter into coherence at all and that be in coherence has the highest intelligence has the highest capacity to perceive and respond to the whatever is going on so you prioritize that so first a - opera - yes okay cool now are we in coherence yes okay cool now and start trying to do something if not if something is out of coherence okay how do we get back in coherence oh is it because I'm out of sovereignty Oh gave me to get back into sovereignty and kind of building back up so we're hoping that the summit is going to be fascinating I'm sure it will be with the speakers that we've got but also fun and if you were to distill down what say three or four principles of having a generative conversation in good faith ah what would they be what conditions allow for that so how do you know you're having one maybe like what are what are the what are the signals that you're actually doing it right that you're actually having a good conversation no wrote apologies apologies for actual wrongs but no wrote apologies don't apologize for things that you did not actually do and if you see sort of a culture of rote apology in a big conversation there's probably fear right underneath the surface similarly I would say look for laughter look for humor look look for and not just you know there's everyone can tell the difference between a nervous laughter and and regular from the gut laughter in which things even when you didn't see something coming or maybe that's and when things get funny when a conversation that was very serious are very technical suddenly erupts and laughter if that can happen there's probably not fear right beneath the surface and another thing we're hoping to do with the summit is create an environment where we can integrate opposites because very often polarization we see in culture comes from not being able to hold two things at the same time and being able to do that is a huge skill that helps us go a long way in having a new type of conversation this brings us to a very important metaphysical point which is that a thing that its opposite according to the left hemisphere simply as far apart as they can be and we move always in a linear way to what we'd identify as good everything I know tells me that in fact opposites are connected and if you pretend that you are only having one you don't notice the dark side and this is terribly true in psychiatry it's almost a truism to say that a lot of the work one does as a psychiatrist is helping people to see that there is a good sight to what it is that they fear and dislike in themselves but there is also a dark side to the bits that they pride themselves on and that you cannot get rid of the dark side you accept it and work with moving it towards something creative and all creativity and all life is creative mental world is creative our daily reality is created partly by us not out of nowhere but it's grounded in something else but we help creator that process depends on opposition it depends on a degree of resistance actually and as soon as you've decided that x y&z are good and their opposites are bad and we must have more and more and more and more of the thing we've decided as good you end up reaping a whirlwind because the things you didn't take note of come back and bite you in the bath [Music] you [Music]
