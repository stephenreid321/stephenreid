[Music] so welcome guys I'm I used to work for Channel 4 News for many years lyonell used to be a regular guest on Channel 4 News and it's it's really interesting I was sort of thinking and I we didn't get to this point lyonell but we were talking before about kind of our political leanings and I I don't necessarily define myself on the political spectrum at the moment much because I'm not really sure where I am but I sort of feel I've always I would always have defined myself as left-wing and certainly over the last five years or so would probably describe myself as politically homeless and I know Tim has appeared quite a few times on our channel we've done a few events together and I know that you define yourselves on the left as well but you also feel very strongly about this topic about this sort of sense that there is an ideological frame that is very uni dimensional and you're worried about how that effects how that can affect art and affect literature in particular but I didn't get to the point so I'm interested to ask well how would you consider your political views or your yeah where would you place yourself in the political spectrum well in desperation a few years ago I came out as a libertarian out of not my inability to find any other word that quite describes where I come from I am frustrated by the whole categories of left and right right now if they were ever useful they're certainly no longer when you've got on the on the Left censorious authoritarianism and on the right pounding on about freedom of speech something's got quite confused so the main principle of libertarianism is just that we should be able to do whatever we want as long as it doesn't hurt other people I think that's a pretty good principle it's certainly the founding Prince full of the United States it's not one that the US adheres to very well right now I don't think any any country in the West really believes that you should be able to do whatever you want if unless you hurt someone else but that means that I'm not big on state control and I'm not big on censorship and I believe in freedom of speech even if it means letting people say atrocities so just to lay out the how we're gonna run the event tonight we're going to talk until about 8:30 we're gonna take a break of about 20 minutes 25 minutes and then I'm gonna come back for an audience Q&A so anything that comes to mind while we're talking just file it away and there'll be an opportunity after the break to to ask questions to anyone of us and I'm also going to encourage Tim and Lionel if you want to pick up on each other's points and I'll take myself out completely of the of the conversation but i when when thinking about this I I'm kind of a very aware with my as a journalist that we're we're in quite increasingly sort of dicey territory and increasingly controversial territory so there was some thought about in the back of my mind whether we should have someone from the other side as it were and and then I sort of I was very aware of that process in myself of this is the kind of topic that we need to have both sides represented and so I'll do that I've got some of the the criticisms that are made especially of your views on cultural appropriation so I'll I'll place up a devil's advocate at some point in the in the evening just just to put those two you have insults read to me sorry I think one of the points to start on is so we called this the war on art and obviously we want people to come to our event so we choose a kind of slightly kind of inflammatory title a little bit click Beatty and that's often one of the big comments made about this that these these views are pretty much just limited to a few college campuses in America it's it's a it's kind of straw Manning the opposition this is not a mainstream view so it's a lot of people getting excited about nothing what do you make of that I think there's some truth to the observation that there's a shrill minority that is getting control the public conversation and that's why we I assume we do events like this to give a little pushback I think for example that the so-called Millennial Generation has been broadly misrepresented because in my experience I meet a lot of younger people who are quite reasonable and as you were asked to be at the beginning of this event open-minded they don't they don't have opinions like look some kind of subscription and they're thinking people and this authoritarianism I mentioned is coming from a minority which is really all about bullying and it's all this all this calling out all the shaming all the name-calling all the labeling is combative aggressive that's one of the ironies of their being so concerned with microaggression what you're really dealing with serious major MACUL aggression sometimes with the express intent of losing people their jobs and making them roundly unemployable thereafter so I don't think it's fair to represent a whole generation this way but I on the other hand I would also say that it is spread far beyond the college campus because we were just talking about that before this event that started the fact that both the Guardian in the New York Times have changed in character drastically in the last five years especially in the last two with with the whole Trump phenomenon and have given over to much more activist indignant quarter and have lost a lot of integrity in the process so any any pretense of neutrality of fairness and and and any awareness of the fact that you have that in straight reporting you're not supposed having an if there paragraph so I've watched you know that's these are people who have graduated from college and and and I do feel that there's a whole larger cultural set of attitudes that are now becoming commonplace and have spilled into the mainstream and they do it it did start out from college campuses but it's not that little anymore cuz I guess this is one of the the big point if you sort of take a big-picture view that the left a lot of the freedoms of speech that we have now were fought for by the left in the 60s there was of the obscenity trials there was the sense of pushing back against a very stifling conformity in the in the 50s and early 60s and the left by the Free State the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley was a left-wing movement for quite a while and now we we sort of through the looking-glass in some way where the left seems to be the the cultural force that's pushing for saying you can't say certain things you can't have certain attitude you can't wear certain clothes what do you make that Tim it's kind of confusing and put you on the back foot I think that's part of the way it's designed it's certainly true that like line I like to grow up at a time when I don't know if I would use the word libertarian because it's become associated with an economic view of the world as well the materialism and I don't think that's what Lionel means bias and maybe she does but I mean it's not what I mean by it but I said oh you know okay thank you for proving me up today on that but I think the idea of individual liberty is very deep within me both as a writer because the novelist mainly and like Lionel and if I don't have the freedom to to experiment with my thoughts on the page then I don't see the point of doing my job at all there's no point and if I can't put that stuff out there and have it received into a climate that will give it a chance I won't try and force it into a particular ghetto then I you know that really worries me let me just talk to that point that you said about you know whether it's just a cup there's a small number of left-wing activists that in fact it's a straw man there's no real problem with that you know I really really can't agree with us I think it's getting worse and worse and worse and once T's every day and it's a process has been going for a long time and it goes back to the Satanic Verses which is the first time I remember thinking Jesus Christ what is going on here and why aren't liberals defending it why are so many liberals turning against Salman Rushdie on who's being pursued after something for some excitonic versus essentially thing happened amongst writers in America after the Charlie Hebdo slaughters in which something like icon of the terrifying number of writers so-called free speech writers that that refused to turn up to the award ceremony for Charlie at being award 200 writers you know that Penn Awards I mean that Shopper hell out mean and depressed they have I mean because what are we talking about the bravery of those those people and Charlie Hebdo was staggering whatever you think there you know and they were scurrilous but that's that's good I approve this goddesses I was really shocked by that I was very shocked by the sort of concern motive strand that has developed within what used to be thought is the kind of left liberal strand and I'm not more you know I am left liberal by inclined water the liberal them to the left and I think it's really seeing only today there was a story about I I couldn't quite get my head around just sort of sort before I came out served in digesting time as a story about a museum in Northumberland it was having a person of the wife of an industrialist there or or and he was the father of not modern modern artillery if I remember correctly and they wanted to do something to celebrate his wife at this stately home but they couldn't find anything that would celebrate his wife so in order to acknowledge her they simply denied him and they went away around and put pillowcases over out over all the busts of men and sheets over the paintings that were about men or by men basically they covered everything up it looked as if they were moving out and it backfired surprisingly so families paid forty nine ninety five to go look at a bunch of sheets yeah I mean that's just one you know that's today you know and that's that's just one aspect and it's it's just it's going on all the time and the effect of it has I mean that's that's an effect that it has on museums but the effect it has on artists generally I think is very very pernicious in so many ways some of them formal some of them informs on the moon tiara so on next area I think they're the main enemy for artists is is I mean at being a writer is an incredibly insecure profession anyway but the the temptation now to try and fit yourself into some preordained markets which you could substitute the word ideological position because that's what sells and that's what's acceptable and that's what you know publishers crucially are going to be interested in because publishers are very very influenced by this climate at the moment and that I have to now something I believe called sensitivity readers belong we know about them yeah this started out in the children's literature and young literature and it's actually the publisher that hires the sensitivity readers so you send your book in and before they publish it they send it to somebody if you've included any characters that are I know people of color or disabled or all of all a bunch of categories they're many more than you might think of I I got a even have sensitive River sensitivity readers for people with terminal illnesses maybe they don't last long I have no taste and and these readers are paid to comb through your manuscript and find a fence that is that they're paid to be offended and and point out where you might be stereotyping or where this is going to be upsetting to this group and this is you know and you know I find the whole thing obnoxious it hasn't spread a unit to any considerable degree to adult literature that I know of yet but it seems to me that it's only a matter of time and the day that HarperCollins sends my novels to a sensitivity reader is the day I switch houses because I think this is a really important point is like a I hear from both of you what your specific concerns are I remember reading that you one of your recent some of your recent writing your agent questioned the fact that you'd you'd one of your characters was black is that right and the the book wasn't picked up oh it was actually just a short story but you know I I've taken on the cause of freedom of speech out of self-interest it's not because I'm a nice person I'm not a nice person but I this identity politics movement has started to hit me where it hurts and that's not just in my journalism but especially in my novels and that's when I say enough is enough now white writers have been put in a very awkward position where they can't win because on the one hand there's this new cultural appropriation nonsense where you're told that people people's experiences outside your own you know if they're black or disabled or even and I suppose the other gender doesn't belong to you and so you have to keep your hands off that's a kind of stealing so that means I suppose that your whole caste has to be set as if it's in the still in the 1950s and everybody's white and it's a kind of literary apartheid but then you get criticized for not reflecting diversity so this is a losing proposition and I would say one of the most important things we need to emphasize here is that these rules coming down from on high we don't have to obey them they only they only have force if we comply so shortly after I gave a speech on cultural appropriation decrying the concept in Brisbane Australia I submitted a short story to my agent and asked her to send it to the New Yorker and she said well I just want to warn you you've included a black character here and so much on the heels of that speech which got a lot of blowback you're gonna have a much better chance of being accepted if you changed this girlfriend you've increased was just a secondary character make her white but I wouldn't there were reasons in terms of the story and the characters that it did it added something that that she was black and and the odd thing is you know it's a fun character somebody who's portrayed is very smart and lively and appealing and and even you know economically not stereotypical she's from an upper-middle class background she's definitely got the wealthiest background of anybody in the story it was sent in Atlanta so that's actually quite credible has won one of the largest black wealthy communities in the United States well of course the New Yorker rejected it and it's entirely possible that it was rejected because the story sucked it's in my new collection property since I can plug new collection and it's called domestic terrorism and you're welcome to judge for yourself whether it sucks but I don't like this new self-consciousness about including characters who are different from me I don't want to have to look at them twice you know I'm fine and I am I'm looking at the northern twice the book I'm writing now includes a couple of black characters and I know they're going to be scrutinized to a minut degree because that story when it came out was indeed examined on a line by line basis when it had to do with anything to do with this one black character by the way if there's anything in this regard wrong with that collection is that it is too white you know it is too much people by people like me so I find I I don't like the self-consciousness I don't like the stay in your lane nonsense I don't like to be told that you know I am not allowed to use what we are now supposed to call aave or african-american vernacular English which would mean by the way that we would not have the series the wire we wouldn't have the movie or the book Clockers both of which are brilliant we wouldn't have home assigned life on the street when you want to start making a list of the number of books and and and television and movie that we would not have allow writers to use the vernacular of other groups of people it's it would be huge and who wants to live in this restricted universe who wants to write this way if joyless it's boring it's boring for the reader so I just think we should push back and I think writers have to push back and not because one of the things that's going on right now is a lot of self-censorship and I think there are I feel that if I'm the one who suddenly felt conscious someone like me who is pretty bulky if I'm anxious about having a diverse cast then a lot of other writers they know who are a little more timid are are controlling what they write to an even greater degree and I think that's where the danger with this movement is we're not dealing with laws we're not dealing with legislation which is telling novelists what they can and cannot write but when you comply with rules they have effect Tim are you more timid than one this just to pick up them yeah just to pick up on one thing this this is very paradoxical that the outcome of this kind of this worldview is that there may be fewer as Lionel separates almost like like a kind of literary apartheid like if you can only write about your experience then suddenly you filled your books up with with with only white characters or only characters who look exactly like you I mean it goes beyond though it goes on it goes on to how the characters arbitrate are portrayed not just about he betray portray not betray I mean I've just written a novel which is got it's got a number of gay characters in it so I'm representing in some sense nominally gay experience and of course it's one of the main characters it's to the main characters of women so I'm representing the female experience and the temptation of the for the fear is that you you have to though you're going to be required to represent these characters that save the gay guys on in previous books I've been black characters in a positive light that they have to be shown as the good guys or the good women you know and I really kick against that because everyone's an asshole you know that's my fundamental statement about human nature you know there are no virtuous people you know ultimately everyone's capable of all kinds of aggression hypocrisy foolishness fear ugliness nd this at least this is part of this order and and to sort of dress up characters as being artificially virtuous you know it just doesn't ring true for this because that's not the way people are and whatever group they belong to so there's always a certain area of nervousness for instance I you know that ended with the woman in my new novel is well you could say she was abusive to the man um which is not something you often see in books one of the gay guys is just tracked it's not certainly not a likeable guy toys a horrible old Queen you know and and you know all I can do in trying to get that stuff rise is talk to people you know I you know in order to portray young as portraying the gay scene in the early noughties it's just I want to speak to as many people I knew who were gay who've been around that time just so what was it like what's the vibe what's what's what do you go through as a gay man I research it you know and I think that's what writers do if they're good or they don't just have to make it up just difference between somebody with prejudices they go out to try and find out what it is about that particular group that makes them particular and I think that's what you should do if you're just writing from an laziness then then I can see that there would be some weight to the argument that you were just lazily portraying stereotypes but so long as you're going in there from either personal experience or from proper research then after you've got every right to portray any so-called groove as if you know I'm not really even believed in groups you know I mean this is seems to be the modern idea that you know as a black woman has a transgender activist eyelid luckiness like I don't get that as an an I'm not you know I don't think myself as a man anymore like I was essentially define herself as a woman you know it's just a purse and and this fundamental humanism which I grew up with for me you you would have the the apogee that was something like James Baldwin who's a you know someone who wrote about Brittany about being black or a brilliantly about being gay but it wasn't just an amazing writer and a human being first and foremost who wanted to write about his experience of being human being first through those venzas you know and he was incredibly sympathetic to the human condition he wasn't near to you know he drank a man he was very angry I had every right to be angry but always the anger is channeled through a kind of fundamental love for people you know and I think that's just that that tenderness towards people at large and their floors rather than raising yourself above them and looking down on and on making yourself somehow their loss appear while simultaneously their victim I just don't find it believable as a stance so you mentioned before about the Brisbane speech we're on cultural appropriation that kind of caused a big reaction and Yasmin Abdul Majeed wrote in the in The Guardian I'm gonna read a little bit of what she yeah she this is a piece from the from her article in The Guardian she said the reality is that those from marginalized groups even today do not get the luxury of defining their own place in a norm that is profoundly white straight and often patriarchal and in demanding that the right to identity should be given up Shriver epitomizes the kind of attitude that led to the normalization of imperialist colonial rule I want this and therefore I shall take it so my my question is if we can agree that some groups in society about harder time than others is there any responsibility for the writer in representing those those groups accurately and is there any truth to to her response to your speech well first of all I think that woman should put me on the payroll she's been done out me and walking out on my speech for the last two years we have a fundamental difference of opinion about what the word identity means and that was indeed one of the points I made in that lecture I grew up with an understanding of identity is something that you forged for yourself perhaps with a lot of false starts and a lot of effort and it was a developing project over the course of your life to understand what you particularly cared about what you loved what you were reviled how you saw the world how you saw your place in it what you are good at whom you liked so it's a very you notice nowhere in that list is what group do you belong in and so I am NOT interested in understanding my own identity in terms of the groups into which I was born through no choice of my own now we're all born into a set of groups some of them intersecting and we all have to live with that and make our peace with that and some of us have more trouble as a consequence of being born into those groups than others and that's where I would agree right I'm not naive about certain group membership but I don't think the answer is to seize on group membership as greater than you are and as fully defining of who you are after all if I went around saying you know the most important thing about me to myself is that I'm white I'd have my head cut off and rightly so I don't go around saying that I'm the most important thing about me is that I'm female I I find the category of having been foreign born female rather constraining and you know I like when I was growing up I like playing with trucks and getting dirty and I hated wearing dresses so I was always wanting to push the boundaries of the categories into which I was born and in fact my presence here today is a testimony to having pushed literal boundaries in my life because obviously you can tell from accent that I was born in the United States but what did I do I moved to Britain I've been in the UK for the last 30-some years so I got out and I think my life has been a great deal more interesting as a consequence so if that's the way that I have found my identity to break boundaries instead of recognizing them and and and protecting them then why on earth would I urge other people to find themselves through through that route I think it's misguided and I and I I think that it doesn't just in my experience I don't I think it's unlikely to lead to a happy and centered personally located life because I don't think going around saying well the most important thing to me to me is that I'm black is is ultimately any more fruitful than for me to say the most important thing about me for to me is that I want I don't think these kinds of big baggy identities are a help in in a large world with many people in it where you have to have some sense of who you are when you wake up in the morning and so you know this young woman in Australia you know for all I know her intentions are good but I think this whole identity politics thing is wrongheaded because the the message is consistent that what you are is more important than who you are and I I reject that utterly and I think who you are is more important than what you are and that's what pushing back against racism and sexism and all the isms is all about is seeing the person and not the category I yeah we've we've talked about this before Tim and the sense that these are good but weeds from your primary axiom and they can lead to madness but the idea of like diversity and inclusivity there they're good values but if you make them your primary mode of being in the world rather than say the truth for example or or your own or personal growth personal identity striving for example to better oneself then it becomes yeah you start you go down a very difficult road I mean I would say as well as someone on the left obviously you would have thought racism or you would you would have seen racism problem how do you swear that sort of holding on to some of those values of the left but not going down the route of identity politics and and this kind of ideology that we're talking about I'm having a few heretical thoughts as I sit here about the whole idea of identity politics because I was just trying to think just answer your question but if it interests me anyway but um I was it was I come from a working-class background and so Devon and I mean the you know and at a time when the working class were ascendant as a voice to some extent in film and TV and there were people like the angry young men in the 50s but that was that was younger me but I mean older than me rather and then it but then there were the kitchen sink dramas of the sixties and seventies and there Ken Loach's cares was a film I remember I remember the white working class which I suppose is my identity originally it's not really much anymore but it's where I came from sorry and you know I also remember times and get the gut to date today even where I think of the depictions of working-class people by an increasingly loved more today than before actually the depictions of working-class people by middle-class and how kind of unconvincing I find them and how annoying I find that the fact is that they're not actually using the authentic item most remarkable things about most portrayals of working-class people in television and radio consider some of our EastEnders is they don't swear was where I came from every other fucking word was a swear word it was almost a defining nature and also their nature the word to us is to be extremely offensive that was kind of rebellious attitude towards everything it was just like fuck you we don't buy into your middle-class values anyway I just sort of thought that makes me see more and more the kind of identity politics side of the coin but perhaps it's a bit like blackface you know I mean like that that they how obscene it would be to see oh and of course we have lost Olivia do you know a fellow not so many decades ago and the idea that you know that that love you can look at cultural appropriation go well you know there is a point there but as with all these things you were saying you know it depends where you root your absolute values do you rule them in say truth or do you root them in identity politics and the beauty of course identity politics is it's a lot simpler once you sort of adopt it as a worldview you don't really have to think anymore you really don't because you know you've got it's a very religious way of thinking and I think that in reality human beings are very religious creatures they think religiously they think tribally and they think religiously I think in groups and they like to think in groups because the kind of idea of my generation which was individual autonomy and working out for yourself is a hell of a challenge it really is you know to try and work out your own values take on the burden of saying I don't know what the hell's going on but I'm gonna try and work it out I'm not gonna do it I will tell us me and I'm not going to do what Marxism today tells me I'm not going to do what the Guardian tells me I'm not gonna do the spectator tells me and I'll work it out and that's a really tough call for most people for everybody in fact but to have the courage to stand there and to be honest in my mind that is what distinguishes a proper novelist or a proper write or a proper artist is there people who are not set and say that's true just because you told me is true I will not accept that I've got to work it out for myself and ask a lot of very very awkward questions and that's an uncomfortable place to be because you're constantly only on the boundary of uncertainty and therefore on the boundary of chaos and confusion and that's it that's a place human beings find very very difficult so the temptation for nearly everybody is to just join the group whatever that group is and that can lead in my mind best to a kind of lobotomizing of your worldview and at worst to the death camps so you know we have to cleave to the ideal even if it's not really a chill for most people we have to cleave their ideal of individual autonomy individual conscience individual understanding individually working out what's right or wrong for us and that's a lifelong task test you to the limit but and too many people will just hide in the group and I find that deplorable and that's what I see is happening today [Applause] Tim mentioned it before but the sense of that there are good and bad representations of people and literature do you like there is something about a disrespectful representation of someone that seems qualitatively different from a respectful representation do you think that's a fair distinction to make mean that Tim was talking about working-class characters as if if it fear there is a sense that it could feel exploitative or it could feel tokenistic in some way well people have been writing badly ever since that respects so sure there's there's such things bad dialogue and bad you know unpersuasive portrayal portrayals that's what Tim was talking about characters that don't ring true and there's nothing wrong with saying that that's what that's what reviewing is has traditionally been for so this this doesn't wash this person doesn't seem real I don't buy it after all that but what I'm carving out is the right to try you know to make an effort and that it doesn't think that that that the fruits of your efforts can't be criticized so we're we all want we all have the right to write whatever fiction say that that we like but then we should also have the right to say you know that that character is ridiculous that accent is rendered badly that character from that particular place would never I think say that you know it's and I don't think it's a matter of respect I think I I don't recognize that as respect it has to do with a kind of professionalism or or an ability to get away with things I mean fiction of every form is really sleight of hand it's a form of fakery and so it's a matter of persuading people that these these characters you've made up after they're not real that they are real that they they form a the achieve a kind of integrity in in the audience's head that they don't really deserve so there's a skill there's a sneaky little skill to making people seem real and I don't think it means respecting them exactly and it and if you're going to make a character work then it needs to be a very individual character and not just be some character that that seems like a plausible representative of their of their people you know needs to be someone in particular that's one things that's so great about the wire just because that came up good example those characters are very individual and they're great and they're memorable and they're not just a bunch of black people being black and so yes there's such a thing as being good at your job and those are those are the writers that basically get away with murder because their characters no more exists than anyone else's but they they perform a con job on the audience that is effective and I want to sort of just just end you've got about five minutes before we take a break by saying where where does this all go and what are you concerned about where it might go because it seemed that this - there's two different attitudes that you can take - for example someone writing a novel as a character one which is to say you've got or you didn't you open it better tential to learn more about someone else experience all there's the perspective of you should not even attempt this in the first place it seems to me that that perspective is profoundly anti-human like it denies the possibility of empathy or of genuine communication I what I fear is that it ends up with us completely sido for each other and that that's very concerning I think it may start with sort of good intentions but what it the place that it ends up is almost guaranteeing some form of conflict because it denies the possibility of true connection across whatever boundaries so slightly sidestep that points though I think it's going to touch on it because while you're talking I was thinking about something important about a kind of direct now that I'm saying what you and I'm sorry I didn't mean that about a concrete example of how censorship or not even central climate is invidious to us I just just popped into my head I will try continental name of the program as a drama mother was on a year or two back about a about a man and a woman showing from both the men and the woman's point of view about who had been telling the truth about whether she was raped or not liar liar I think it was called no it's called like in school though I noticed not some another anyway in the end it turned out the guy was lying and there was a piece of the spectator which I thought was absolutely right said of course the guy was right they could not have ended it any other way it would not have been allowed and that's what was because once you start having that thread in the culture that you know it just becomes boring there was a kind of time when black characters are represented in movies as pimps and gangsters you know we had to move beyond that then they became represented always good guys and so okay which is kind of where we've somewhat stayed you know I think we need to get a point where we say these are all people you know and you can get you know there are bad people in every single there are disabled bad people you know incredibly I'll make a fascinating transgender point I have no opinion about transgender matters he says self-defense abide was doing a fascinating piece I've not done anything with this piece of information I haven't and I probably be scared too but I was when I was I also did got a column for The Guardian until recently and about my family in one of the things that came up I was bullied and there was a survey that so I found a big survey on bullying you know they didn't take a piece of year's economy around the Pacific server and you know they then they broke it down so are you male are you female are you gay I'm trans you know and and you know and they asked some questions like have you been bullied and they would also ask questions like have you bullied anybody and that was the interesting question because and this is what I haven't seen followed up anywhere and anyone used a journalist who may feel free to do so is that they found out that you know boys were slightly more likely to bully in girls something like you know quite high I'm just like something about you know twenty thirty percent of boys and girls admitted privately they had bullied another person and and gay people were roughly the same trans kids were like seventy five percent of them said that they had bullied which I thought was absolutely remarkable you know and I thought that was not what I expected at all in that survey there also said that huge number have been bullied but they're also bullied and that just made me think you know what with every group you find is full of people who are have a dark side you know and if you can't betray that dark side in the interest of some airbrushed view of reality and you are selling our art you are selling out truth you are selling out literature you're selling out drama you're selling out TV or selling out films you're selling out what is the most important thing we've got in this culture which is a love of the truth and love of reality so I hope [Laughter] so if Tim won't answer my question do you answer my question of where where does this go are you concerned about what the kind of the natural end point of this way of thinking is well obviously it's getting worse so I have no reason to believe that it's not going to continue to get worse though cheerfully I sometimes theorize that the way out of this is catastrophe because look this is petty shit right it's definitely what they call first world problems it's a product of prosperity in fact if you take a look at most of the people with these identity politics of movement it's they're pretty well-off the kids have middle to the middle class or middle class this is not actually a working class movement at all so these are a bunch of people who are dare I say it privileged ok so what we need to shut them up is something like a nuclear bomb going off or climate change taking out a whole time something really crap to put things in perspective and then I dare say that's the last you ever hear of microaggressions so thank you Lionel thank you Tim we're gonna take about a 20 minute break and then we'll come back for a QA [Applause] actually managed to get the live stream working so there were a hundred or so people watching and commenting and etc and also clapping with the Mota cons at the same time you guys were copying but with the delay so that was good so we're gonna start with actually one of the livestream questions from Tonga and the question is and any I suppose anyone can answer it feels call - question is should the people who are thought policing be engaged with argued with or should they just be completely ignored and left in their own bubbles to kind of fizzle out I I find it very difficult to talk to these people they don't tend to be inclined toward listening they're very shouty and I think that's why we're probably best off not having someone from the quote other side at this event tonight I mean I do think these conversations are worth having but there's a there is this women this whole safe spaces mentality is has to do with an inability to listen to a position that is obnoxious to them they can't there they that is regarded as a form of assault someone else's opinion with which they don't agree you know if they calm down I think we should invite them over yeah I mean I'm sort of with Lionel I mean I just you know it's a very despairing thing for somebody who believes in free discourse to say but you know I have sort of slightly sad personal experience to this in some ways because my daughter who's now 25 went to university quite a good university Leeds and I was you know very excited that she would come out with us an amazing critical mind and open thinking and I was so depressed when she came back it's just her mind it closed completely and you know she had no concept whatsoever that there might be anything yeah I'm perhaps this being true of students forever I don't know but I mean I've found it very depressing you know that there was all the channels of communication had closed down and and it was just you know maybe there's a father-daughter thing I don't know but I don't think so you know and I found it terrifying if that's what universities are doing to people and I ain't paying their tuition fees anymore that's for sure so we'll take some questions from people in the audience very first hand to go up so I'm just going to repeat part of the question for the viewers on the livestream and John your point was Jo sorry Jo Jo your point was that there's a different there seems to be a difference between cultural appropriation and racial appropriation racial appropriation is what seems to really create a big big reaction I actually think it's pretty well observed that's it does seem to be much more about race than anything else after all when men dress up as women or women dress up as men we're thinking supposed to think that's great I guess that's the kind of gender cultural appropriation right so it is quite specific to race the trouble is if we're going to [Music] if we're going to establish this idea that you own your racial culture let's call it for what it is your racial culture first off of course we have the trial problem of mixed-race people I mean what did they own where did they belong what is theirs and furthermore if you own your racial culture then why can't I turn around and say well then black people can't use an iPhone right invented by white people you can't play Beethoven you know you can't read Dickens it's mine it belongs to me it's white people's culture now turn that around I hope you could hear how utterly absurd that sounds and also ungenerous ugly you know I don't want to own my culture and you know what I didn't invent my culture it doesn't belong to me because I just inherited it I didn't earn it you know it came to me and I will try to honor it by reading Dickens you know or listening to Beethoven or using my iPhone but but I don't want to limit myself to that culture because it isn't supposed to be a prison and in fact my culture belongs to everyone and there is no such thing as one culture and in another culture they blend all together that borders are completely fluid that's the way it ought to be and one of the reasons that major cities in in around the world are such dynamic places to be is that those cultures are furiously interacting so we do not thrive even economically by putting a fence around ourselves and protecting our intellectual cultural artistic property none of this stuff believe belongs to us it's all borrowed we came into it and we're gonna have to give it up when we leave so I think that we need to encourage a sense of generosity you know I'm not a you know I have some problems with the whole concept of multiculturalism just because it comes with mass migration which I don't want to get into that but it it's associated with master migration in a way that hasn't always had a positive impact but at core the concept of multiculturalism is sound that is it's this big interaction we run into each other we share ideas we share the things we make and where both of us you know we're all enriched as a consequence and that's what's so utterly wrongheaded about this cultural appropriation nonsense and I honestly do believe you know whether or not we get our our upcoming catastrophe that cures us of all ills this is an example of something that is not going to survive and and will later be held up as an example of the ludicrous excesses of our era [Applause] so first I think it's it's it's it is unlike unlike we're talking about some how the whole idea of of the war and art might be a bit of a fringe activity the obsession of a small group of sociology students and people in academia and I think we rejected the idea that was much more serious than that cultural probation on the other hand I think Germany is quite a fringe issue I don't think anybody really worries that much about it except quite a small number of people in the universities having said that I think there was a time when it was at quite a valid concept and when I think of Elvis Presley coming on and you know taking basically black music and making a fortune out of it while all the people who were Chuck Berry and so forth were just scrubbing in on the pennies because all the white record executives were just taking their money and and the same with blues men you know ripping them off and leaving them with no I take your point I just think that firstly I can speak louder than you cuz I have the mic which I think I see and has to be taken to account and also I think it's in some ways a fine point because the people you know that you know the faxes that why people had the economic power in the 1950s and they had the means of production if you like and they had the means of dissemination and black people didn't have that possibility and you know there is quite a to resist the feeling they were ripped off big time and you can call that an economic argument if you'd like but you could also call it a cultural argument you can also call it a matter of cultural appropriation but I think those times have really passed you know and I don't think I think now the idea of you know world since world music has Carmen the whole idea of us borrowing from other cultures universally is pretty widely accepted as a positive thing I think it's quite a small group I just want to note the fact that during the break I was talking to somebody who is in a litter EA j'en C and is constantly having to deal with this whole cultural appropriation all the time so it seems to me that maybe it's not as small and confined to a tiny group as you may think so we'll take question there so Charlie Brown's question is is this is this a unique time or is this just it always feels like this that there are always these taboos and our culture it's just that they just sort of shifted into different places is this a particular salem witch trial kind of moment well i think we are obviously dealing with the results of secularism of which i am a big proponent but i'm afraid that we're you know the group we're talking about is in the grip of a kind of evangelical fervor and you know to be fair we're dealing with the mostly younger people who are thirsty for purpose and and faith you know and you know as a reason to be in the world a guiding principle to tell them what to do I mean I'm not a I am profoundly secular and therefore I don't tend to subscribe to a catechism of any kind and my general answer to that thirst is well you know I'm I think you're you're on an individual journey and that to subscribe to a catechism is it is a shortcut that cheats you but it is very seductive and you know religion offers a lot of things it Wofford offers community and this particular religion also offers an enemy and it you know far be it for me to decry people's eagerness to believe in something but my biggest problem with this on any politics movement is that it is too negative it's too fired by if you will a word I read 50 to 100 times a day hatred okay it has too much of a need to demonize it is a very predatory movement and it thrives on taking people down and I don't like the generational element either you know it's become young people versus old people and a creepy way I grew up with some of that stuff that old don't trust people under 30 nonsense and we got over it yeah don't you yeah actually that's interestingly misremembered that's that's someone over 30 remembering that phrase yeah I don't I don't I don't like the hostility I don't like the venom and the need for anger and righteous indignation it is you know Tim may talk about how we're all awful I'm sure we are but some of us are more awful than others and and you know this religious movement is capable of bringing out elements that might otherwise be ameliorated if the ideal ideology were otherwise but the I just I really don't like this viciousness and you see it on Twitter all the time and and it's the people who are the most vicious you get the most attention and it's one of the reasons I I'm not on Twitter because why would I want to but as a religion I find it wanting and the other the other thing that that it's wanting is that it's calling people to embrace their own weakness this it's become totally trite to talk about the exultation of victimhood so that's taken as a given but it means that you incentivize people to to identify with their own degradation that they're their own oppression and to embrace that oppression unless they become powerlessness it's become this weird flipped thing so that the most people who have the most depression or the the most exalted and I you know I just don't think that's the answer that has not been the answered in my life for exam well I mean the only thing I might cling to the victimhood front is being female on it is not you know that has not made my wife being treated like shit because I'm a woman and being underestimated because of a woman I'm a woman it's been you know I want to be remembered for my books and maybe for events like this one but not because my father never expected me to become very important you know I got over that so yeah it's interesting it's taken sort of this long before the word religion has kind of been brought up because it's a very interesting part of this kind of this this ideology that it does seem very religious in tone I know you mentioned something like that when we did our interview a few months ago yeah I mentioned earlier this evening as well but and that question it's beautiful the gentleman mentioned Salem of course which is which trial conducted by the church and Arthur Miller wrote of course the crucible based on the sin in which Charles which is a kind of and he wrote obviously as a rejoinder to what was happening in McCarthyism in America at the time and it's all really there's two kinds of religion there's the declared religions and the undeclared of religions secularism is another kind of declared undeclared religion in some ways and certainly the social justice warriors and radical left have always been a kind of undeclared religion whether it's now or Stalin or you know Nietzsche pointed out in the 19th century that once God died that you know what was going to rise up to fill the void was was more terrible than religion ever came up with and that was true it was religion without God and that's still what we're seeing we're seeing that we're seeing people scrambling around to find faith in something only they don't call it faith they call it justice they call it equity they call its identity but it's religion it's quite simply a religion it's a religion because and that's why as Lionel said when you try to debate with these people you won't get any further debating with the Reverend Ian Paisley you know because you're debating with people who've already made up their mind you know and I spend all my life not making my mind why the hell can't other people you know I mean it's just do you know why are people so arrogant as to think they know the hell's going on he knows what the hell's going on certainly not me you know and um and these people swaggering around going about how they know this is right and this is wrong and this is right this is wrong oh fuck off [Applause] so Bianca had her hand up earlier so if your anchors question is about quotas within the TV industry for example 20% of all leading roles going to be a any characters for example well it it troubles me I can sort of see the principle that one should try and make the figures stack up though they seem to be going quite a long way beyond stacking up as far as I can make out but I mean you know if there are 12% ethnic minorities in the country then in a fair society there will be 12% of mainstream actors it's I think I think it's way beyond that actually now but I mean and it seems to be a sort of kind of counter reaction to the idea of the domination of white a majority culture for so many years so I can see their argument what worries me I suppose is the is is that it's replacing something ineffable and unquantifiable with something quantifiable and measurable and ask isn't quantifiable and measurable the trouble is in other words it's threatening quality and who can say what quality is I don't know what quality is I know when I see it but I don't know what it is and there was once a culture at say the BBC where there's a kind of a group of producers often Mavericks and you know some of them are Mavericks some of them weren't but there was a bunch of interesting people who had the license disco hmm that's an interesting piece of work we should now you can't defend what an interesting piece of work is it's this like saying you know proved to me that Picasso was a great artist I'm not gonna prove it to you say you know how's the house how's the bane representation going so I could show you statistics on that you know and that's becomes measurable and its enormous ly comforting to people of a bureaucratic mindset to have something measurable so that's that's my more general and high-minded reason for posing the other one is that when they're out trying to sell the screenplay of my new novel it's like we're not interested in anybody who is a white middle-aged man and no one's no one wants to look at it they're interested in paying writers they're interested in women but if you think you're going to get your adapted you know it's just not going to happen now that's my selfish reason it's I seems a bit unfair could be a shit book I don't know but then Mike could be it could be expressive but but the idea that that putting myself aside and not something I like to do but if I if I did come back to me again I would I would really worried that this idea of this very intangible idea that is lodged in a in a culture impossible to quantify that there's a kind of and it's very elitist that's the problem it's very elitist because it relies on certain people with what we also can't quantify called taste you know and and and artistic sensitivity and and cultural insights can't measure any of these things you know there was it was just it's just once upon a time people take a crack at it just because it was interesting now in a place where we can we you know it's part of the box ticking culture where we can say the following characteristics and I can you know why you asked me if it's any good I mean that's not the point is it you know yeah it is the fucking point so I think we've got time for two more questions so I think you had your hand up before so I mean thank you for this really interesting and I agree with a lot of what you say I agree when he you aren't Sweeney truth all of that and we need complexity and openness but I think the concern I have is sometimes we're talking about this we're ignoring the real dangers that there are in the world right now of for example when you talk about arts you're both artists that come to it from a place of good faith you'll hear you're trying to write and to create art in a way that's getting to a greater truth but there are people who use art in a very different way and one example of that obviously is you know the thing we've just seen about grenfell that's arguably piece of arts which is done in order to incite hatred and that's something that we're seeing it's growing and it's dangerous and if you come from a background that because it creates hatred and we've seen in the past okay fine why is that dangerous okay if you're if you come from a community which is going which is which is gonna be the subject of hate because it helps repel someone else in Trump's case for example a populist you can become demonized and we know in other countries what happens when you demonize people if you look at Rwanda the use of demonizing certain groups was used to strengthen other groups and that ultimately led to violence that's the lesson of history so I mean for me seeing that kind of thing happened without recognizing the dangers inherent in that it's problematic okay let me just get this straight you don't think that burning a paper representation of a building is going to lead to our machete in each other in the streets respect I'm speaking to you with respect and I'm listening to everything you're saying I believe in a lot of what you're saying but you know that it's not as simple as that right you know that that you start off by mocking people by making them less by making them the target of hate in some way and yeah a burning burning a piece of art is a way of minimizing them of making them of making them some it demonstrates them being less than other parts of the community it's it's an easy way of transferring kind of distracting people from what you're doing by demonizing this other group and that an art can be used in that way and you can laugh at that you can you can laugh right but that's the problem isn't it isn't isn't yeah but that's your perception but that's your perception that's your perception all right I'm gonna go out on a limb here unusually um I found that case very interesting now it isn't really a piece of art but let's see it was you know what's called a piece of art I mean maybe they think of it as art it's an arbitrary category the question is whether or not those I think it was mostly kids wasn't it because with some adults - okay alright uh yeah I don't even care who did it interestingly though interestingly the cops are unable to pin any crime on these people it's not a hate crime because it that that disaster did not belong to one of those specific protected categories of people so it's an interesting it's an interesting case now look I am the first person to admit that was an excruciating ly poor taste but I think it should be legal I don't think those people should be in jail and we could call it a piece of art we could call it just an act of demonstrating how thick and crass you are but it's not illegal to be thick god most of Britain would be in jail and it's not illegal to be crass it's not believe it or not illegal to be racist and I think that's one of the things we have to get our heads around because you know we all have prejudices we all we all approach each other with little categories in our minds and little preconceived notions sometimes they're they're too positive oh you know the Asian over there he's so good at math and that's the kind of prejudice but prejudice is not against the law and I think we are we are losing a distinction between social decency which we would all like each other to display and therefore social indecency and criminality and it's not the places the state to enforce social decency we we all have a right to have an opinion about these people who put together that model and thought it was so hilarious and so I'm not saying that we shouldn't decry it it was not funny it was a very poor joke it was ugly so I'm not defending it but I don't want them arrested I mean it's it's a it's a really good question I think any date so it goes to the heart of a lot of things that make me uneasy and I don't know simple because one can remember back to the thirties and dished in the Nazi press who were publishing articles that vilified Jews they're sending burning down Grenfell is not the same thing but I can it's part of the spectrum of the argument that if one allows hate out there it's going to have some terrible consequences and it's always a question of balancing these rights I have to say I'm a hundred percent behind Lionel in in the idea that this is this is you know Varnum pathetic but when I heard that six people have been arrested over it it really sent chills up my spine you know this is this is you can't have the police going around some stupid guy who's it's it's also part of the the what you might call the shift in the definition of hurt you know and I'm sure if I had a relative at grenfell who died and fly be extremely hurt by what they had done and offended and upset but I just can't live with that definition I can't live with it and anything we can live with as a society because once we go down that road of psychological hurt amounting to a crime I just don't see where that ends you know now I I just think you're on a terrifying Road I mean I really sympathize anyone who lost someone in that building to having to watch that but as Lionel says there are there are crude stupid and and wicked people out there and we can't lock them all up and and and that that that whole you know I I mean if they they were you know and it's it's not an easy answer I mean I there was that story about countdown kilo and his dog that did the Nazi salute and and you know I don't know there was something about that man made me uneasy as well I don't mean the uneasy because he was a he was arrested I mean I was definitely uneasy about that but I was also very uneasy about what he was doing not so much teaching a dog or nicely salute but it was what he was said he said gas the Jews and it was like something about that phrase that I found it wasn't even I hate the Jews it was gas the Jews you know it seems such an extreme it doesn't sit now I'm sure but I'm sure it's better than gas the Jews somehow you know keeping out keep an eye on him yeah I mean the trouble is you do you do have to you do have to put up with a lot of as Lionel said a lot of assholes in the world you know and you can't lock them all up and and I think once you start looking there and also there's always the problem of who's an asshole you know who defines an asshole you know and and once you've got you know you at the moment we've got a political climate it was quiet stringently I would say you know left-wing in terms of social positioning but if you switch that and and it was the right-wing who were defining what was exception and what wasn't I think you would be you know in dangerous ground if you if you had someone like if you had someone like Donald Trump you know who's America is protected by free speech laws which were not saying you know what I find it offensive that you you presume that you present these left-wing opinions against abortion for instance or in favor of abortion and I want to suppress that because I consider it to be wrong and immoral and in favor of murdering people even though they're very small you know incipient people who's doing the defining you know and I think that's that's the real danger but I take your point completely and I you know I it's a horrible thing but between justice in the law there's quite a big gap I think but thank you for your question so we are at quarter to ten so I think we're gonna have to end the Q&A here but there's been yeah there's a lot of energy in the room and I think we definitely should do more of these events so I'm gonna finish by saying thank you very much to Lionel Shriver [Applause] and also to Tim isn't it 92 [Applause] and and we have we have another event here in exactly two weeks time which is within McGilchrist the writer of the master is emissary and that will also be live-streamed if we can get it working is it working now great and good bye to everyone on the livestream Tamron I'll say wave goodbye to on the livestream thank you very much for coming it's been great thank you you
