[Music] so tin this is going to be an interview that we're gonna put out as part of a little series called Jordan Peterson and the left or what can the left learn from Jordan Pederson that we got in contact first because you wrote the first I think the first spectator profile of Jordan Pederson at about the same time as I brought out my documentary and you've described yourself as an old lefty so I think it's really interesting to kind of to pull that apart kind of where what is have the reactions been to what you've put out there what have you gone on a journey with all of that staff and and what do you find kind of really enticing about Jordan Peterson so I from a working-class background in London I was a journalist when I started off then I started writing books I've also worked in the meantime as a journalist for The Guardian primarily I've been a columnist on the Guardian till the end of last year but I've always seen the Guardian as my natural home I've read the Guardian for as long as I can remember so that I'm certainly a leftist to that extent and we've pretty much probably discovered Jordan Peterson and more or less the same time maybe all of you I think well I don't know I was I was I was I will I don't even remember how I came across Jordan Peterson other than in the context because one thing I haven't said about my career is I now as well as write books teach writing and I've been studying how stories are generated and the shapes of stories and the structure of stories and that's how I came across Jordan Peterson way before we got into this whole debate which has somehow got all in tang with politics which I've never seen Peterson primarily as a political figure I mean I know people interpreting that way and in some ways he is a political figure but that's kind of not what interests me about him what interests me about Peterson is is a purely professional interest in some ways is he's understanding of where store is come from and why we need them and how they are laid out in our imaginations both psychologically and in terms of the culture in other words in films in theatres in whatever the novels I mean you know if what if my practical question was if I can crack the problem of what makes for a compelling story it's going to make me a better novelist you know and I'll be able to use that tool and teach that tool and Jordan gives some brilliant lectures on stories whether they're the Lion King or whether they're Hamlet or whether they are the Bible but well I'll get to the Bible but then the smaller stories like Pinocchio you know these modern fables he started you know that was his starting point as it were and I followed all those stories his analysis of these stories buting the beasts being another one Pocahontas you know he was I mean he's from his analysis and Pinocchio is particularly brilliant you know and I I've um I've tried to you know I've read Joseph Campbell the mythologist Ariat from you know who wrote the uses of Enchantment about children's stories I've always been gripped by the idea that there's a kind of underlying story bubbling up in a soul that will as artists trying to somehow inflect in our own way but it's always in some senses the same story and if it is the same story what does that story mean what is that story why does that make us moved or interested or involved and that's where I think Jordan Peterson is absolutely fascinating he's fascinating about how the individual what he's a psychologist and it's the how how this thing works with respect to psychology and the most important thing from me quite apart from his work with you know these stories modern myths was as you say his investigation into the Bible and I've always been fascinated although I'm an atheist I'm always been fascinated by the power of the biblical stories I often found myself looking at these huge cathedrals and churches that sprouted up all over Europe you know and and ask myself well what's that about you know why was this story so powerful I mean yeah it's the defense against death if you want to be cynical but hey you know it could be lots of other stories you know why is this one so unbelievably powerful and what does it mean for it to be so powerful and pieces I think brilliantly answers that question in the biblical lectures he's done and he really changed me those lectures who genuinely did I think changed the way I lived my life because he came to this very very important conclusion which I'm pretty convinced by I don't think I'm ever 100% convinced about anything but I'm very convinced by his idea as I I'm someone who's suffered depression and depression is like a crisis of meaning in your you know it's the worst thing about depression is not about being miserable it's being having a life that seems utterly meaningless and that's why it's such torment and Petersons in a way tries to answer the question how do we as an individual that's a bit of a paradox how do i as an individual acquire meaning because meaning is the most important thing any of us could have you know there's meaning as it you know if you don't know and yet no one could quite say what meaning is which I think is interesting in itself no-one says well I want a sense of meaning what is a sense of me what is meaning and Petersons I think it knowledge is that mystery but also it says well you know if you want a sense of meaning it's not about just doing what you want it's not about just following your bliss as Joseph camp would be or having a much fun as possible or or even necessarily being happy no absolutely no not necessarily being happy it's there were more important things than being happy and and I've also fair that to be true in my life I'm 62 now and I've been through a lot you know and I found that many things that unhappiness has given me so much you know unhappiness has given me so much in terms of in terms of meaning trying to pick through the bones our once our unhappiness is what one enriches you and that's the story that is the story of nearly all great stories that that suffering is a way of raising yourself above your animal condition if you choose to let it be and that the suffering that involves in a change in yourself and this is what we teach in story narrative which all great stories are about a change of one condition into another condition and that's what makes a story compelling it's this making this change and the the the the pursuit of this goal of change is what actually what we mean when we talk about meaning that somehow to aim for something higher than yourself even if you can't quite name it I mean I would use you know that aim the word for that same as authenticity maybe that's one of the words I'm not used to try and discover my own goal is to be an authentic person to be a real person because I had a very strong sense when I was younger that I wasn't very real that I was kind of two-dimensional that I was a bit like a cardboard cutout and I could be blown away by the wind at any moment and my experience of life and going through a fair bit of suffering I would say as everybody does I think I've probably had you know that's probably who some worse experiences and some better experiences in other that this that this suffering has forced me to engage with what it means to be alive and has enriched me in some sense and that struck a very loud chord when I you know not dying anyway glamorize so I don't think anyone should seek out suffering you know but but I was very taken by Peters's message that life is it's not about being happy life is about suffering okay well that sounds a bit that's a bit a aurash in this day and age when a lot of people have a very pleasant life you know and they don't really suffer that much and I get that you know you can have a very nice life it it's just not very deep life you know it's just not a very profound or resonant life and somehow in my experience when I meet people who've been through really lousy crap somehow they're kind of interesting you know they're more interesting than richer they're deeper but they may be amiss others might just be you know it might have done the wrong thing with that stuff and become just boring assholes you know but I mean but it gives you an a strange opportunity because when you're you know in a in a crisis you have to question your life very deeply and you have to say what's gone wrong now as Peterson would point out a very common response to that is someone else did that to me society did that to me the ruling class did that to me men did that to me women did that to me white people did that to me you know and there's something in there but it's not really a sufficient on my case you know as a working class boy not very working-class anymore you know the the ruling class the wealthy people the upper-class did that to me you know deprived me of a decent education deprived me of any material pleasures when I was up until I made my own money you know and but it's not you know and i but i but i really have a gut resistance perhaps again from my background as a kind of sort of respectable working-class self-help kind of ethic that it doesn't do you any good even if it's true to cast yourself in that role your story is not going to be very good one there's not gonna be a very nourishing one if you put yourself in that row might be easy it might be in short term you know it's rather like junk food a junk thought it's like oh it's all their fault it's a little bit therefore but as Peter says it's also a little bit your fault and maybe it's a lot your fault you know and and you've got to watch that thought because if your or depressive like I am you know how that can flip over into a kind of acute pathological guilt about sort of you know I'm the worst person in the world because everything's my fault and I think that's a danger I've spoken to Jordan about this about this idea that you know this I this I this idea of intense personal responsibility which he advocates I'm not so much with him on that you know I think you could you can get a bit carried away but I do think the modern left has lost lost touch with their essential liberal trope that we as human beings at our deepest level are individual souls that are all value you know and we have an intrinsic instinct as it were for morality and that morality is important and that's the modern project let's not think about it you know and let's get on with our lives let's buy our iPhones let's stay on the online let's watch love Ireland but let's not think about it because actually it's not really a soluble problem and you know it's all about power anyway blardy blar well you know maybe it is a soluble problem and I think Jordan Peterson is the first person in some way it's not the first person there are the people Alan Watts is one of them and Joseph Campbell's another thief he's really you know and you people who've really approached that question but I'm not a great one for distracting myself and the big problems of life because I wouldn't be a very good novelist if I was but with that territory goes a lot of uncertainty and fear and and I'm just a to go together and and and yet also fascination and meaning and I I guess I have a similar take and why after I interviewed Jordan in October last year I then kind of thought I want to turn this into a documentary precisely because I had a real sense of how important and how meaningful his message was and I had already got this this real impression that it was being lost on a lot of people because they couldn't get past the political stuff absolute and absolute and so that's why I made I made it into the documentary that I did was to sort of to try and create because it's so impenetrable I mean where do you start with Jordan Peterson there's these lecture series there's so many different ways in or there's so many difficult ways in because you've got to watch so much of it to understand and so I tried to make this documentary to kind of I guess I already had in the back of my mind a lot of my progressive friends and their kind of reactivity to what he was saying and to try and say no no look at what he's actually saying look at the kind of Jungian underpinnings look at the story look at the the deeper message of what he's what he's doing and I guess it's it's been a constant kind of I found myself in that conversation so often oh and I mean we both we both feel like the political lens is probably not the right one to look at Jordan Peterson through but it's almost impossible in this highly politicized world not to kind of look at him through that lens or at least for him to be pulled into that frame all the time so I'm interested as a fellow but we both probably consider ourselves at least or coming from the left yes so I'd love to hear have you have you had arguments with people many and many arguments up that I've kind of given up you know because I mean it's really being quite depressing in a way I mean I thought we know when I when one tries to and this is really one of the things that pizzas and rails against and I think very rightly is that when one tries to engage with people on certain subjects they're not really they're very resistant to discussion though rather just start shouting at you or accusing you that the of being you know a fascist or something or a sexist or something you know oh they'll throw person abuse at you and and and instead of saying yeah okay all right well you might not find this a very attractive but what's your answer what's your rationale you know I mean if Jordan Peterson has a meta-study showing that men and women are fundamentally different in the way they behave in all cultures and there are like hundreds of studies that all show the same thing what do you say to that you know I mean I don't think it's politically sexist well that's what they say to that but it's like why is that sexist I mean you know you don't you know it's it's it isn't sexist that's all to me to say that men and women might and you know you only have to say might to get into big trouble might have different in warm proclivities and this is the reason it's so taboo is because the social constructionist view has so gripped the left and I thought it had died you know at the end of the coming down the Berlin Wall and the failures of Maoism the failures of the failures of communism January which is a hot which is embedded in a whole mindset Marxism and later post Marxism I didn't say that when I was at university I studied political science so like Jordan I studied to territorialism and I studied the Russians and I studied how the mindset worked and it was terrifying like him I just thought this is terrifying but I thought you had gone you know I thought that was dead but what I've seen is it being its recruit recrudescence through the Academy through the universities suddenly it's back the difference is they don't know it's Marxism or they call it post-modernism you know but in fact it's the idea that only power matters that there's no absolute truths they're all truths of relative this to me is garbage you know I mean it's I mean you can you can make an intellectual argument about it but it's still very patently not true you know that some values don't tell me that dignity isn't a real thing don't tell me that respect isn't real it'll thing don't tell me that love isn't a real thing you know that it's all power it's not true you know I know it because I know my inner self and my final point of reference is my inner self my soul if you want to use religious terminology though I'm not religious but my soul is where I look for my final authority not to the group that I belong to or not to the group but anybody else belongs to I'm not interested in I mean I'm vaguely interested I recognize it has a part to play but finally and fundamentally it's the individual that matters and how could I think anything otherwise as a writer if any job is about the individual voice it's the job of the novelist you know if you know films are collective projects writing a novel is the ultimate individual acts the ultimate individual voice and even that is coming under pressure now you know people they have they have I think they're called something like they're not called morality readers but their policy reader diversity readers know how editors now who check you know that you don't have a uni appropriate you don't have any inappropriate opinions in your you know even for your characters that's a really deep sickness as far as I'm concerned that is that is totalitarian thought and it's totalitarian thought not in the government but it's the totalitarian thought mindset but I see on the Mars it hasn't expressed itself in government yet we're still too basically a plural society but that mindset this I know what's Rhys and you if you don't agree with me or wrong and what I love about pizza is that he says you don't know anything you know you're very small the world is very big and you can't possibly grasp it so have some bloody humility you know and I think that's so true because the world is incredibly complex and we all have to construct stories around it but very few of us seem to have the courage to say I don't know what the hell is going on and I'm just little me so let's listen to each other and try and work out what the hell is going on but people are so scared of the chaos that that involves the sheer magnitude of the problem if you like but they retreat into these little rigid narratives and say well that's the way things are you know and I hate that I mean I really viscerally hate that the idea that people insist out of fear of the complexity of the world I'm just understandable but you know it leads to hell at least a schvitz and it leads to the gulags you know once you are too scared of reality and reality after all especially with the rise of the Internet has revealed itself to be so complex that the more complex it is the more terrified would become and will out control the world seems to be the more we retreat to our bunkers of certainty and yet you know if you're being human means anything in a kind of mentally eeveelution Airy sense its tolerance of uncertainty is to be able to say I don't know let's work it out and if you can't do that what have we got we've got totalitarianism so I'm very much Ben Jordan Peterson on that all the stuff about women I mean I think all that's and and and and and the pose I mean he's right about the postmodernist I think he's right about Marxists I think he's quite right so whether there is quite as powerful as he thinks there I don't know but you know I think he's he's identified a really a really clear and present danger and he's had the courage to stand upright because I was talking to you before we were running is that the trouble with the postmodern neo-marxist line is that it invariably puts you on the defensive the moment they come at you with these ideas you're racist you're a sexist you're a misogynist you're LBGT averse whatever you know you always lamb offer you know the whole dialogue is about putting you on the back foot and making you feel oh I am a bad person I should shut I know all right maybe you can go and go or I'm not gonna engage with you know you think I'm a bad person but the point is you start to shut down you start to be scared you know to express your view and I think that's yeah and you also drew some really interesting parallels with the show trials in communism and this sort of sense of we've all got this internalized sense of well there's something where I've done something wrong at some point that all of these even Spanish Inquisition and like though I think that's that's the sort of truth that pretty much every great Inquisitor has come to it's like everyone has an internalized sense of shame around something if you can find if you can tap into that everybody wants to confess you know and their their sin because they feel they've done something wrong I don't know if it comes out childhood or some ancestral inheritance but everybody deep in their heart feels they've done something refresh an idea of original sin yes it is it's it's it's certainly akin to that you know and that need and one of the most loathsome and pathetic spectacles I I see is is is people desperately so I'm sorry I'm sorry I said that you know I'll never say it together because that just makes it even worse the moment you did better but you know it's a groveling that goes on for people speaking what they see is their truth but that is it is really under threat I think and and it's not and it's self-censorship and it's it's by cutting and you know the BBC also i've always been a huge admirer and supporter of I think there's something in the idea that their agenda has become narrow and narrow and narrow and you know they're thinking within very small boxes now and I'm very reluctant to align myself would say the Daily Mail which I loathe detest and despise and let me make that absolutely clear but the idea there's a kind of bias within the window in the DBC I think it's hard to argue against it you know I think they are quite within that sort of cultural framework you know you kind of know what they're gonna say before they say it there's not a real there's nothing real which is why the intellectual dark web is developing so powerfully is because the national broadcaster is not giving us those genuine honest inquisitorial conversations that they used to you know all they're all we're really getting is this is what the BBC although they will never put it that way this is what our collective view is on morality it's goes back to the wreath you know idea that we have to educate the public because they kind of fear the mob you know and that's that's something I again coming from worthless background I don't see the mob to be feared you know I all the working-class people on you although they didn't have very appropriate opinions a very decent good people you know and I'm much better than their so-called betters you know morally so I don't have that fear that mob I trust people to be good people but there's still that sort of elitist idea that you know if we don't sort of educate these these plebs out of their house out of there you know nativism you know they're all going to begin marching up and down giving Nazi salutes and you know on beating up their wives and that's just nonsense there's a yeah there's so many things there to pick up on really interesting because one of the things that you often hear is people on the Left saying oh well he talks about cultural Marxism there's no such thing and what you're expressing is yeah there's cultural Marxism there there's cultural Marxism ii-in in literature already because people are and I think I feel this as well like it's almost it's almost more it's far more than politics like the most chilling effect is being had at the level of the dialogue of what's allowed to be said you know it's not allowed to be said yeah and that I think is is where we both should have share myself as a journalist you you as a novelist both share a lot of concerns around what it means if you've got a public space where certain things are not allowed to be so I feel incredibly passionate about that you know I mean I just think again as a novelist I've got to be I've got to be allowed to be wrong you know without even bit without being accused of being you know 27 different things that are all to some extent or other evil or you know to be disapproved of the point is I've you know I've got to have my characters be able to express the way real people are you know I can't just say this is the way they should be because that's the death of literature you know and that's why literature and arts in Russia died the moment the Communists took over from a wonderful rich history of literature and art suddenly dead you know and same with maoism you know I mean I don't know about the history of Chinese culture I've got no idea it's very different culture and now they seem to be emerging out of it in some ways you know but you know I think it's it's terrifying for an artist what is happening and what's particularly terrifying about it he's quite a lot of artists to signing up to it you know they're signing up for the sort of you know I was most shocked of all I don't know there are some shocking things that happened in the in the lot in my lifetime I'm certainly on the subject of the 7/7 bombings in London I was shot and Salman Rushdie how many of my so-called left colleagues as it were apologists for what was happening simply because they were out in America and therefore anything that sort of you know anything that and also cultural Marxism supposes that all cultures are equal which i think is rubbish I just don't think all cultures reap I think some cultures like cultures like people some are better than others some are nice that some are cruel and others some are more noble than others some are more you know they're like they're just like people as Plato observed you know and I think the idea that everything has a kind of equal value I was gonna say the most disgraceful moment of artists betraying their trade to me was the Charlie Hebdo massacres took place and the American pen you know after the award was given to Charlie Hebdo for the extraordinary bravery I mean my god yeah I knew they were in the front line of Islamic state at that time they knew it you know and they weren't on publishing not just you know because they took the the Makia Islam as they did with everything else you know that's what they did they were sort of riding on France you know and that that though American writers stood there and refused to turn up for that ceremony because they disapproved a Charlie Hebdo that made me want to be sick I mean I was so disgusted by those I mean these are writers these are writers that people should be write up a heart of free expression you know and and that they are selling that out I think is shocking beyond belief there's you know there's two things here one I've talked about especially because you can look at it you can look at this sort of wave of cultural Marxism and sort of what people can say what they can't say and all of this sort of media latin media creation as okay we we don't like it but you can also look at it as it's backfiring tremendously look at Trump look at brexit for me those are do things absolutely well would direct responses to what I've kind of called the shadow of liberalism this sort of this feeling of inclusivity that includes only people that sign up to this this this this this and this and anyone who doesn't think like that is a bigot is a yes and I think especially in America this is what created this is what's created the political backlash that we're seeing in the UK in the US and this is I cannot understand how progressives or suppose the progressives cannot see this that some of them are now sort of doubling down and like oh wow it's far worse than we thought that they must be these people must be even more evil than we thought they were yes yet before the the American election he had Milo you know Palouse who was an openly gay man who talks about his black boyfriend's getting mobbed a like these are not personally or these are not personally bigoted people this is this is something that that didn't fit with the kind of narrow that's it the net people I mean I don't know much about Marlowe but I think that's one example but I mean I do think it's interesting that I think a lot of a loss of a loss of manifestations are appearing of political philosophies both in political parties and sort of on the ground as it were that just don't fit anybody's particular narrative the terms right and left do not really apply very well anymore I can finally quite find it hard to put myself in that spectrum anymore I don't really know what it means anymore you know and it's why I think there's this terrible panic to get Jordan Peterson in the right wing you know because you know he's not right wing you know he's not any wing he's a thinker that has a lot of his own ideas and you know I mean though the Kathy Newman interview being a hilarious version of you know that's the most transparent version I think of what we're talking about people trying to be forced into a box you know by the dominant so what you're saying narrative so what I'm saying no I'm not saying that but you know it's very insidious it's very dangerous I think I I think something's changing I don't know what and I don't know how fast and I don't know what's gonna happen you know but I do think Jordan Peterson is someone who's had a lot of guts to stand up for against if you like people who did not want to have this conversation you know and he's just saying let's have the conversation and he's got his point of view fair enough I'll give him don't call him you know don't try and flush him down the toilet because he's a devil you know it's it's ludicrous absolutely ludicrous so I don't know I don't know I don't know where we were this is all gonna take a stated I mean you know I'm I'm not particularly optimistic but as you say things are changing then there are there are shifts happening under the surface yeah where they're leading I don't know they could be leading to populism they could be leading to yes they could be leading to a kind of mob rule certainly that's what happened with mid brexit to a certain extent they could be in empowering the elites they could be leading to the breaking up of the posts modernist neo-marxist standpoint or they could be increasing that I don't really know no one seems to know it's just like it was a very interesting Adam Curtis short film the other day it suggested that the powers that be if they exist these powers that be as opposed to just being a chaotic slithering of different interest groups the powers that be are almost willfully turning the narratives into snake pits of chaos because it just makes you go oh well because you don't know what else to do they go oh well I don't know you know and I've many times been hit by that says this is I can't deal this anymore I don't know what the hell's happening you know I just can't make sense of this anymore and I think you know one can say okay that's just that's just a phase that we're going through and we'll come out of it or you could say actually there are there's intelligences behind it that are actually conspiring to make the world a more confusing contradictory and therefore manipulable place and I don't I don't know I mean I'm confused you know at least I'm not afraid to admit now I'm confused which helps might be maybe I get I guess for me the way that I can frame it is to just pull this apart it's like you can have and I wonder if I'd like to hear sort of maybe Jordan Pederson framing in this way as well cuz I do think like one of my criticisms of him would be that he certainly comes across as speaking in a very combative way when he talks about the left yeah that I think is not going to help convert people like I think I think it he's almost been like roped into one side of the culture wall and I think partly partly that's that he just keeps being dragged down to the political level by by people who are interviewing him but what I'd love to hear him say is something like okay these values that you hold so dear quality don't if you could bring himself to say diversity but certainly fairness fairness as a value these are good values but if you make them your primary axioms then you're in trouble you're basically every lesson from history shows that if you make fairness your primary determinant to the political system you just end up in chaos or you end up in you end up in in hell almost immediately well well that's one of the issues I have with Jordan Peterson is that I think it's true that if you make fairness at outcome if you like the political aim then you are in trouble but I do believe in fairness and I do believe that that the system as it were is run in favor of the rich and powerful and I do believe that the system has to be to some extent moderated by the state you know and I grew up at a time when I was saved by the National Health Service I was a very sickly baby I was able to go to university I received a grant for it at the age of 27 you know I VIII went to a grammar school you know good school from a working-class area might the benefits of the state intervening to promote fairness is not something I'm against but I can't get down with equality of outcome I can certainly get down with equality of opportunity and I think Peterson is the same but I think he's he spent too much time I think trying to be sort of an apartheid low bourgeoisie you know person who's just gonna go I don't care he don't like guys say you know he's got a bit he's got a bit drunk on that I think you know and he might want to enter it's not for me to say what he no he should do but it would be wise I think if he could you know perhaps as you say talked about and he has talked about he has talked about fairness he does talked about the proper role of the left-wing he has talked about the fact that you know there is a place for that but it's just very hidden you know and I think he might want to he might want to you know rather than be led all the time by what other people trying to lead him into this into this snake pit of not very healthy narratives so no let's look at this side you know I am I'm you know and this is why I this is where I doubt sometimes doubt how much he has invested in the idea of you know shall we say I mean you said he supports quality opportunity for instance you know okay well I'm completely down with that bit you'd only hear that from him very much you know he should shout it from the rooftops you know he should if he's got liberal and leftist credentials if you want to call it that way he should be shouting from the rooftops and you know he doesn't very much you know I think he's you know he's quite an T status as well as being an T but he was supports a you know he sports a public health system he was sports the National Health Forum says we're so having Canada I mean it's not what you know it's not what the neoliberals want to do it's not what the Conservatives want to do you want to strip back the state to nothing so he's a much more nuanced thinker politically and he allows himself to be presented that's because he's got he's got very very overexcited perhaps by the idea smashing down the canals of the I think for me it's this kind of realization that what started as really valuable contributions on the left like marginalized voices being heard a view of the people who are being left out of society all that sort of stuff and in which is essential has turned into something of a religion and I think a lot of people are starting to realize that it is actually being seen as a and that blasphemy against it in any way or being seen as a blasphemer against it only way is is incredibly toxic or is incredibly it's it's a career-ending accusation to be thrown at someone which is now starting to put certain topics off off off limit now it's very toxic very toxic indeed yes the human mind is a religious mind we think religiously we don't think rationally you know we think whether in our religion is Christ or social or post Marxism post post-modernism and they're Muslim they're all religions you know the liberal view is is is is that to go back to an earlier point is that we don't know you know and that's the anti religious point that's saying I don't know let's work it out that's where that's what everything comes down to can we say to each other I don't know let's work it out you know not saying and the religious view is now I already know you know I think that's what I think Peterson puts his finger on with a totalitarian view you know is that that it's he made the religious point that the devil is somebody who said they didn't need or an entity that said they didn't need any knowledge outside of what they knew no that was the beginning end of reality is what they knew there was nothing beyond that and that in a strange way is kind of where we're at you know with neo-marxist and post notices like you know the beaming you know an ending of the world is what I know and that I know it I look I'll look like I think I don't know anything you know and that's humility I know any it's very prideful to say you're humble I'm not saying I am but I do think humility is a virtue that should be very much treasured and aimed for you know and the idea and the beginnings of humility is to say it's a very very tough world to understand people are very complex the world is very complex and before you start organizing his have a think about that because you can end up in hell very quickly you know and and and you might have been born into a generation that didn't know how but it's happened time and time and time again through our history that could happen very quickly now because of the internet here interconnectedness and I don't think I do think Peters is right about the Academy I the academic assumption is failing in its duty you know I don't think it's teaching people to think in the way that they once said it's also become part of this this malevolent kind of limitation of thoughts you know and when they when that's happening in the universities which Peters have talked a lot about you know you are training the next generation of leaders and that's a dangerous path to go down and that's the totalitarian nine set you know to me you've got to have humility about what you know and yet you've also got to have conviction about what you believe so I have convictions about values and one of those values is freedom individual freedom of thought now I can't I can't defend that to you in a logical way except by introspection and thinking what's more precious to me and be able to think what I want to think I mean though the evil of the communist societies was you weren't even able to think and that's kind of the way we're going is that oh I can't have that thought because it's a misogynist thought or a racist thought so I won't have that thought you know although it might be an interesting thought you know and it might not be at all misogynist they might leave me at all racist but you're scared to have that thought because that little kernel of guilt inside you is activated you know and I I think that's that's a very dangerous place given how collective we are as a species how we love to join in with the mob how he loved to believe we're individuals by acting in a very uninhibited istic way how we love to have the approval of all the people around us how he loved to fit in how he hate to stay and out how we you know and all these this a very really what we call its group nature tribal nature you know is I only under the surface very and it's getting closer and closer to the surface that tribalism which is which is the opposite really of enlightenment values and says no we're not just a bunch of tribes with precious individuals yeah this is this is something I fear because I my sense is that some lessons have to be learned the hard way and I have a sense that it's the a big thing that that we have lost is the lived experience of those who learnt those lessons the hard way the second world war generation and that's what I fear is that it's now a whole lifetime since the since the lessons will learn the hard way in the Second World War and what we're seeing is as we lose that sort of sense of those lessons being learned and all of the structures that were built up after the Second World War that we may have to learn those lessons again the hard way one could also ask that question about the fall of the Berlin Wall you know which is much more recent you know and and that's that's my masses as bad as you but that was 40 years later than that than the end of the Second World War there's plenty of people who survived that you know who who can give their testimony to where that way of thinking dies and you and I have to pick up a bias alternates and to know how those people but you know is he on the list after all he's no white man does anyone bother reading him anymore why listen salts man soon when he's a white man with a beard you know because he's got why does since dusty ask you know he's a dead old dead white man no this is you know you listen to voices that have something interesting to say and once you start saying we don't listen to you because you belong to the wrong ethnic gender group we'd only hear what you got to say because it's only about power all you've got to say is tainted by a desire and which is just you know that's a sick way of thinking about the world it's just not true it's just not sure yeah and I want to pick up the point you made before like humility kill him that so really that's the really key point and in my interview with with Peterson I asked him what are the prerequisites for genuine knowledge and he said fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and he said psychologically that means that what you don't know is more important than what you know that God in this sense is standing in for the mystery or the sum total of the world that you don't know I think unique you need to think you need to hold that as if your life depended on it I think that's a very important point and it's something Peterson hasn't talked nearly enough about which is what he means by God you know when people think oh he's sort of Christian well what does he mean by God he doesn't make this point but I've read enough of his stuff and looked it's not lectures to know exactly what he means by God what he means by God is all the stuff you don't know and don't understand and the future which you don't know and understand well that's one meaning of God I guess there's two meanings actually you know but but but that he doesn't see it as some sort of supernatural entity that's going to guide your outcomes if you believe in him to some happy ending you know he says that's the fundamental human orientation towards what they called God at the time of writing Bible was that thing that they didn't they couldn't control that was really controlling them and that they could bargain with it in the way you could bargain with the future you know in the way you bargain with God you know and that you and and at the same time the world like God he's unknowable so I wish he talked a lot more about what the hell he means by God you know I heard him talking to Matt Dillahunty about sort of God and taking LSD in there no mate you know you're on the wrong track here you know I don't what just just tell them what you think God it you know it's not it's not mystical you know it's actually and I don't know really where he stands as I don't know how much of a Christian is but I think that really appeals to me that idea you know that the word God is is is not what we take it to mean and this is how the meaning of the word developed as a powerful and often malevolent force that we have to deal with you know and I think that's um that's a good definition of God this is a great place to end yes thanks very much David I really enjoyed that thank ya
