I really feel that there is this collective subconscious rage that is just boiling in women and it's coming up in so many ways we see we see in the media and and what's going on is this unknown rage that comes up in in many different ways um and on one hand it needs to come out we need to clear it it needs to be expressed it needs to be acknowledged on the other hand it's not enough this is only like this is breaking the ice so that the next step of evolution can you know consciousness can start coming through and that's what I'm lacking in women it's really to take responsibility for what we do as women in our manipulation in our seduction in our control and and it's so easy for women to say but that's just because we're angry and men did this and patriarchy but it's it's such a lack of responsibility and this women really need to know because we could say we could look at say me too which has been kind of ongoing for a long time and as still a massive force and we can say that it's it's brought up a lot of male shadows it's brought showing up a lot of male behavior that is just inexcusable should not happen and it's it's certainly you could say started as a positive thing but then you also have like there's there's perhaps a danger of it's slipping into a very simplistic narrative of men as only aggressors women as only victims is that something that you're worried about I'm very worried about that because what it feels like is it has displayed the male shadow but who talks about the female shadow the rage that that women are expressing blindly and projecting onto which ever situation and whichever men that they can this is this is where women need to step up and take responsibility and stop blaming men it's pointless we need to transcend this we can't solve this we can't solve this problem from the steps from the same level we need to transcend and look at how am i adding to this dynamic as a woman because we are we are co-creating it in perfect harmony if women are angry we absolutely need to take responsibility for getting ourselves to another place I mean that's the the kind of shadow work is the acceptance that we all have shadows that men certainly have a shadow there is a shadow around masculinity but there's also a shadow around femininity and while part of the cultural conversation now is toxic masculinity and everyone knows what you mean by toxic toxic masculinity if you talk about toxic femininity everyone still knows what you mean but you can't have that conversation which is it's it's interesting what is allowed to be said and what is not allowed to be said at the moment and that Dad I think is is very dangerous that certain topics certain conversations are off are off-limits and this is where we see where we see the victim persecutor dynamics activates it because women become the become the victims and we make ourselves the victims and we persecute men but in that aggression in that reach and when we are the victims we are in perfect control we become the persecutors because we say it's all about blame men did this and men need to take responsibility but in that we become the persecutors it's also a problem with the media because the short attention span of the media wants to polarize things and it's a very is therefore very easy like it's a very straightforward narrative victim perpetrated and yet the true dynamics needs something more than just a very short analysis or a soundbite it needs to be unpacked over time and it needs to be it's easily taken out of context which is why it's such a hot potato for the media to handle I think it's also it's a very very old story about you cannot say to a woman in the public debate take responsibility for the for what you're doing take responsibility for the role that you're playing into and and I want to talk for a moment about the President's Club I don't know very much about the details but I I think that women in this country when we enter the room we have an absolute right to put up a boundary we have an ability to put up a boundary and say I'm not gonna play this game I'm not going to co-create these antagonism between men and women I'm not gonna co-create this patriarchal structure and be a victim if if if I if I'm working in a bar somewhere somewhere and someone is groping me I have the responsibility on the right to say stop it right now go to my manager have that person kicked out or walk out of the room no one needs to be a victim and this is what women just simply don't want to hear they don't want to take responsibility for we are co-creating it we like being the victims we like blaming men instead of doing our own work and say what am i getting from this whole seduction control manipulation I get power the power of the victim and it's it's it's the easy power it's the cheap power and it's not long-lasting we really need to have this conversation in a balanced way mmm because I started teaching men's work maybe a year ago or so and the REE the biggest reason for that was I could see a need for it individually and among a lot of the men that I know but also because culturally it just felt like this was a time when men were being challenged to step up to evolve as men to integrate our shadows to kind of to be confronted with sort of the negative traits of masculinity and to integrate them and move forward but I know that some people might look at men's work and say oh it's divisive what you're doing is kind of perpetuating the patriarchy for example what do you think of that as a criticism it's it's a really good question because in my experience when I when I work with men and women for me it's very obvious that that women really relate to self-development and to to to go in deep emotionally in themselves where I feel men Imoh vague or not as on it and it might be that I'm a woman and that men want more more kind of safe environment when where there's only men to do that but I feel that men have been somehow lacking in in really engaging with their own personal development really taking responsibility for for their belief patterns for their for their emotions for how they show up in the world and in my work I feel that I'm going deep in womanhood what does it mean to be a woman this is what interests me this is what I'm passionate about it's it's about the deep feminine and women are drawn to that so many women come to me and say thank you for showing up in the world like this now I'm getting a sense of something that hasn't I I haven't had it modeled you know in my therapy practice we talk a lot about childhood and how are your parents and and so few women have had muddled a healthy feminine so that's what I'm passionate about but in that work I feel I've gotten to a point in my life where I'm thinking where's men I don't know about men I don't know what's going on for them I can't feel them I don't feel they're showing up I know I'm talking very general but this is what I feel it's a lack a lack of willingness to show up with a woman that is present and this is what I'm missing this is why I feel men's work is so important because women are trying to do their work and there's a lot to do still I really want to admit that but men need to show up and right now there's one man here and one men there but most men out there are boys still and I'm sad to say it but I feel and women are girls so we're both sides we have so much work to do I'd always found men's work really helpful I've done a lot of self development work but what I really found with the men's work was that landing in my masculinity landing with other men feeling comfortable in in myself around other men healing those wounds then really allowed me to meet women on a much more from a much more grounded place and I found my relationships with women improving with the amount of men's work that I've been doing and so I really wanted to start leading men's work and bring that kind of work to other men and then my background as a journalist I've always been very interested in in kind of following the media and then I saw those same dynamics playing out in the political sphere the Trump Hillary election was just so clearly from my perspective that we're so desperate for genuine masculine values and so missing them that somehow some strange caricature and facsimile of genuine masculine values people are voting for and suddenly this guy who's a boy pretending to be a man is the most powerful man in the world so these these these dynamics are playing out in all of our lives and then on the wider scale it's it's quite astonishing to see that I think that there was perfectly highlighting the sickness of post-modernism that we have completely we have we needed to smash the values so post-modernism is is is a good thing but we cannot stay there we've smashed the values no one knows what it is to be a man and no one knows what it is to be a woman and we see these caricatures we see someone stepping up and doing something oh let's go that way because we've lost ground men have lost ground women have lost ground we're calling for a more empowered feminine that's like in the world Oh patriarchy now we need to call in the deep feminine but what about the masculine we see an absolute caricature of a man being so powerful in the world because it's exactly where we are if we don't change this is what we get so we're getting it's a very very healthy lesson for the world to see if we don't start changing this is our future we've arrived to that future what are we going to do about that and also I think it's important to say that what I'm talking about and I think you can tell me if it's what you're talking about as well it's not about going back to the old masculine feminine dynamics it not it's not saying men have to be stereotypically masculine women have to be stereotypically feminine it's going through this kind of gender neutral space and re embracing this sort of our feminine and masculine essence and playing those roles out more consciously for me it's like an evolutionary step I absolutely agree we need to go through this we need to to pull everything apart but we need to put it together again and say we never have the the the truth where is the truth the truth is always changing we we are in a stream of evolution we never arrive at that place but we need to keep questioning and we need to put together those pieces that makes that create solid ground for us that creates these these maps that we so that we know where to go so we have role models we have we have people we have values that we resonate with so so we're not just lost and we see that even I'm from Scandinavia and Scandinavia is one of the places in the world that has the highest amount of gender equality but what also happens is that we see as somehow gender neutral space where men and women are the same and it has it's so important to move through that but especially many friends about sex yes exactly men are completely losing their identity and losing their power they are losing they're losing the essence of masculinity and women are somehow taking that over and getting bitter and resentful about it so at the surface it looks like a really equal society but in terms of relationship in terms of polarity it's not working very well you watch the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman interview what did he what did he think oh I my whole body contracted and I I felt so sad for womanhood I felt disappointed and I could see how the shadow part of womanhood was acting out I could see how the collective rage was acting through Kathy Newman and this is what happens is that when that's unknown its projected blindly on to whatever stick wherever it sticks and it was very clear that she already had an agenda and she already had a projection that she was just looking to state she was she was just looking to have that confirmed and she was trying so hard and I felt this was just a classical example of feminine manipulation of the deep shadow manipulation control abuse so I felt on behalf of women I felt sad and disappointed because we need to have intelligent conversations that that that is aligned with the evolutionary stream that is aligned with creating a future not destroying but finding those values have an intelligent conversation and in that sense I would have loved to see Jordan Peterson become present with that in that moment and say okay I want to timeout from the debate that we are having and I want to explore what's actually going on right here because I can feel you're coming with a lot of anger and I think it's important that that anger gets acknowledged but that we become real with what's going on and say it's a projection I understand why it's there but I would like us to find a way to move through it this is what we need as men and women instead of blindly projecting our rage on to whoever man shows up for it and you said before something about that she came in as a victim but but under the surface was abuse it was about it I felt it was absolutely abusive that she was manipulating everything that he was saying she was manipulating it into into the image she had in her head and she would just twist what he was saying and she would not listen so it was not a conversation it was it was a power game and she was the abuser and I I felt cringy on behalf of women that this is not an empowered woman this is not the empowered feminine this is the underbelly of feminism this is when feminism goes wrong this is not the future it's not the future to blame and to project and to persecute can you explain what you mean a bit more about when feminism goes wrong when feminism goes wrong we allow the collective rage to act out through us so we see every situation we see every man we'd see every encounter with the lens of of the victim and we're so angry about it and it's it's boiling in every woman it's right under the surface so she will quickly snap if if this if there's a reason or if there's an apparent reason because it's so strong it hasn't discharged it's in the collective and that rage needs to discharge but it needs to discharge in an intelligent way not in an unconscious way and you said before that that rage is often directed at men not showing up I'd say it's it's two-way because yes it's it's targeted at men not showing up or they are causing it but it's very often projected out to men that are actually trying to show up that is actually engaging and we will engaging with women and actually talking about these things so that's that's because then we we bring up this topic and then it's so easy for women to tap into that collective pool of rage and it it just comes out and it's also very difficult as well because one imagines that that combative attitude is something that has served her well in the past and it's something that she's maybe felt forced into because of the nature of the society that she's operating in so it's a kind of catch-22 situation for the many successful women because they feel that they're pushed to be more masculine and then when they're more masculine they get judged for being more masculine it's it's very sad and and and I can see that dynamics being played out absolutely but I think the only thing we can do is to take responsibility and say okay I'm doing that do I really want to compromise my femininity do I want to compromise my integrity do I want to compromise my gender and play that or is there another way that I can be powerful without being aggressive without playing a power game but resting in my natural power resting in my natural dignity resting in that deep rootedness that we both have in our genders that when we are peace with it and when we acknowledge it in ourselves it's there as a natural thing and this is the thing I don't want to make this personal about Kathy Newman because it's it's in that potential is in every woman but it's because we are persecuting our own femininity what's being played out that we're doing it to ourselves because we don't trust that it's good enough to be a woman we don't trust that we can have conversations that come from a felt embodied perspective we don't trust that we're connected to truth because these these masculine ways have been have been very strong and women have been denying their own power and I also want to say that this isn't even though the the specific example is the Kathy Newman Jordan Peters an interview it's not specific to to Kathy Newman I think the fact that that interview has resonated with so many people that it's been so popular shows that actually something archetypal was going on in that in that interaction and I think as well why it's gone viral is a lot of people watching it recognize those dynamics they're like I've been in conversations like that I've been in this conversation where nothing but nothing I say gets through so there's something sort of fundamental about about the masculine feminine dynamic that's going on in there what do you think that is I think Jordan Peterson he's everyman Kathy Newman she's every woman I can tap into that rage like this I know it in myself and women that say they don't they're just denying it because it is in the collective so in that sense it just highlighted what what's there it's wonderful because here we really get to look at why is this so important why is it so important to listen to to a thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it seriously and say what can we do with it it's just so obvious that it's needed because if this is where we are if this is where society and cultures is if this is the ability to have an intelligent conversations conversation then we are in trouble in the interview that I did with Jordan Peterson he said that the Animus possessed woman which is the woman who sort of inner masculine side is a kind of defense for the feminine side sees every man or project onto every man the patriarchy the tyrannical King and the way out of that to see it from a Jungian perspective that the masculine archetype has both sides the masculine archetype is both the tyrannical senile king and the benevolent father at the same time and so that they're multi-layered and you can see either side and in in any man but the animus possessed woman only sees one side and that is the patriarchy that is a tyrannical system that is something that just needs to be destroyed does that make a lot of sense to you I feel that's that's precisely what's going on it's this blind projection that makes every man in the situation it it create it makes it into an image so and and and that that image is where all the rage can go so I I would absolutely agree with that but another thing I want to say is that that rage that is just waiting for an outlet also has also is important information in in the sense that it needs to be heard it needs to be acknowledged and it is also there because women haven't found a way to be in our power which is not necessarily the way of the mind and the way of having an intellectual conversation about something it's about coming back to the body and it's about coming back to feeling the energy of what's going on and really trusting that we know in our body a deep truth that cannot necessarily be met or acknowledged in an intellectual conversation and because women have not been able to articulate that deep truth that deep wisdom that deep power that's also where the rage comes because we know that deep down there's something that hasn't been seen and acknowledged and by men and we're so angry about that but we just forget that we have to start with ourselves and to say okay I feel something is going on here how can we address this in an intelligent way that is not just pure philosophy and it's not just a pure intellectual conversation but it's in touch with what's real it's in touch with life it's in touch with co-creating evolution co-creating consciousness and we can't do that only in an intellectual conversation where we just we just we're just arguing against each other shadows it's not really symbolic completely yes an ideological conscious yeah that reminds me of something that I've heard before that men test ideas and women test men and there's some truth in that from what you're saying it's like because women know on a deeper level than men and women know when men are out of alignment on a much more deeper level than men often do and so there is something about women's embodied way of knowing and a genuine it's a it's a very you it's it's essential for women to test men it's like so how aligned are you and that I think is what is playing out on the wider the wider culture this the excesses of feminism you could say our men being tested on an epic cultural level to show up to grow up to acknowledge our shadows and to be present and that is is maybe that's the evolutionary step that we need to see but then also like you're saying women need to acknowledge their shadows as well yeah but I think that was playing up perfectly in the interview in in the sense that Kathy she just got more and more angry and the reason why what was missing out was a masculine being present with her and feeling her instead of just meeting her with the mind because that's going to feel overpowering if you feel if if you're in your emotions and in your body instead of being really present and say I feel your rage I understand it so that's where we can start moving on because the feminine will feel seen she will feel respected in that embodied truth because yes women have something to be enraged about for sure and we we need that to become real and not to be just become a power battle so yes women test men to call them into presence and embodiment and just an intellectual conversation is not enough it's just gonna keep stirring up the rage so we need to find a way to have that conversation where both the body the deeper waste and the deeper intelligence and the mind is there present on both sides so that's what I mean about having an intelligent conversation it's not just the conversation of the mind it's a conversation about what's real what's aligned with life and that's a whole different conversation it's a different way of communicating so that's what Jordan Peterson could have done better in that interview is just to have said I can feel where you're coming from I think that could have changed the whole energy the whole dynamic and it could have moved it forward but it's impossible to move it forward when we're both in battle mode so yes if you want a more direct experience of some of the
