[Music] earlier this summer this film from women to men I'm a woman who's published online I am a woman where a group of women apologize for how they've hurt men I am a woman who has hurt men who has heard men was art men I do in our time when we can truly empower ourselves by owning our parts of the mess and bring an end to the cycle of hurting and blaming it went viral with hundreds of thousands of views online news articles as far afield as Israel and Belgium and some very polarized reactions [Music] so the impulse for making this film came out of of a deep longing for healing bit of the wound between the tendus the link to my working experience my work background yeah there is one for sure I've been working as a mediator for more than 10 years now so in conflict resolution work helping people to get out of very stuck in different difficult situations and conflicts and my experience in this work is that the patterns we are used to think in either or either I'm wrong or you must be wrong either I'm right or I must be guilty either I'm the victim or I'm the perpetrator it's always even or and we get stuck in that and that this is never true in the end and that it does not lead anywhere and my experience in this conflict resolution work is that it's really always the moment where both sides start to look also at their own contribution to the conflict that something starts to shift and that a new way out of it and really something new can be created and can happen for me it really it really put its finger on something that I've never seen addressed in the kind of in the public debate it's not it's not to say like this this is the full truth but it's like this is an aspect of the truth that no light has been shown on I have a lot of friends who are activists a lot of feminist friends both men and women and I knew the kind of reactions that the film was going to get so so there was a sense of like okay this is gonna take some courage to to do this because a lot of people are not gonna like it I was an activist myself for a long period of time and very passionate about making the world a better place and doing lots of things and as I started my own growth work I became aware of a lot of my own shadows if this film doesn't challenge me when I participate I shouldn't participate because I have to say something here because I've never said it before and I have never experienced before that I'm allowed to say it without being drawn without being blamed without being the witch and what is the reaction being so far from putting the film out into the world most of them and most of the feedback that I get directly is very touched voices from men and women men who say that they started to cry but they had tears in the eyes because they have never heard this and that it felt so healing to them and then they are very critical and controversial reactions to from both sides from men and women from the woman's side what comes most as fear or critic is an understanding of the film as if we said it's all our fault I understand the anger and rage that can come up with that and if we truly said that in the film if we truly said it's all our fault you are all excused any abusive behavior from man towards woman is excused because it's all our fault if we truly said that rage and anger would be the right reaction I think but we don't we don't say that so what are you saying what we are saying is let's have a look to what we are doing to contribute to the situation that is as it is and we want to change it so your film has come out almost a year after me too but it takes a very different perspective and almost polar opposite perspective to me - why do you think that is and is it a response to me - when I've been writing this text it really came out of a moment web came out of me this was in August 2017 and I think me too started in September October so it was actually before me - it had nothing nothing to do with it unless you can say there is there was a lot of stuff in the field and what I brought up is one perspective so it's not a response to me - it's another perspective I think that what is important in the mid-to is that women started to speak up and to say I won't hide anymore because I am ashamed of what happened to me I'm going to tell you and I'm going to say it's not okay it's very important but I I feel that there is really one perspective missing and it's interesting that this perspective came to me to write a text about it before me to even start it but when I look to it now because the film has come out after me - of course I see it as another perspective - the whole picture and an important one because it's really not very present in the media and society so far some of the comments online have been kind of the tone has been you're letting women down you're betraying women in some way have you seen that of what do you make of that like you we are the women who betray women right it's so interesting because when I did this film and after shooting it even more than before I felt I am saying this for myself I'm saying this because I embrace all my mistakes and all my shadows at least I try and when I hear we are betraying women no way it's so much self-love at the same time I somehow liked it because what I really don't like is every human being with a vagina is is has this duty to laugh every other woman on earth like the sister goddess I see it's all refreshing if so many women don't want to be my sisters because they don't like me it's so refreshing it's like what happens ladies come on we have different opinions that's not a real problem we have real problems out there we have real problems in our bed let's deal with real stuff so when women say you'll be try women I think you are the one fighting against my freedom in this very moment no fucking way I learned my stuff that's what I would say a lot of people look at me to which started last October and this kind of message that you're putting out they feel is too early because it's only now after many years that women are finding their voices are setting their boundaries or speaking to things that have happened to them and then to immediately come in and say well we need to look at our stuff as well too many people especially many women I think they feel this is too early what do you say to that yes I have heard that too you know I can see that on a personal level of course I can be in a deep process of just starting to look at to allow for example memories come back of experienced abuse to allow my wounds to open up to feel them to truly feel them and I can be completely absorbed by that and then being asked to be bothered about men's wounds and to own my stuff could be far too much in that very moment and at the same time saying while I have not healed my wounds yet and even on a collective level while as long as we women have not completely healed our wounds we should not look at our shadow and take responsibility for our part is stupid or even dangerous because that will and then we will not change anything I think it's not either/or it must be both I have to care for my healing and for my wounds it's so important and I have to look into my shado pardon what I'm doing because otherwise I will never truly empower myself I will never access my natural power and while I'm trying to heal my wounds I'm acting out of my shadow towards men in a way that they will continue the toxic behavior towards women and we will get more wounding and it will just continue so I think if we truly want to change something if we really want to do a new step we need both care for our bones and take responsibility for our shadow so something I've been struck by with the reactions that people having in is there's a lot of discomfort around this issue in this something that I know for my personal growth work my own journey is that that is the essence of shadow work like the definition is like you don't want to look that you don't want to go there that's why it's gone into the shadow and the the beauty of it or the healing is that if you have the courage to look and inquire into that and own it on those really uncomfortable sides that actually you know we don't want to ignore this it's the irony of so often the things that we least want to say are the things that breed connection are the things that create healing and I really believe that I personal experience that that's true in one-on-one relations with humans and I really believe that society socially what's happening in society it's just a larger manifestation of that I apologize for the lack of empathy you didn't encounter if your partners and wives when we suddenly want you to show feelings and understand ours I sent out the poem or the text message to various women's networks asking who wants to participate and I had a lot of very powerful and enthusiastic responses not only oh yes maybe I will but really a thank you for putting words to that and this is so much needed and I want to be part of it and so we came together in different filming days and did not only have the filming but also huge processes to go through because it was not easy for all of us the women chose what they wanted to say they chose the parts they were touched most of or they felt they wanted to own and most of them chose the most difficult things for them because I said that's that one is tough it's tough to say that and I feel resistance also to saying it but I feel it's so true and I want to own it I want to apologize for all the mixed messages you get from us women when we do everything we can to seduce you and then end up blaming you for being too horny and only wanting to have sex many women report it afterwards they experience and many of us including me were not only exhausted but even feeling like like we were going to be sick by falling sick different kinds stomachache headache migraine whatever a lot of different symptoms showed up nightmares also not being able to sleep and it lasted only one day and one night and I had so many feedbacks of how the next day I woke up and I felt light I felt fresh I felt more alive than ever I had the feedbag of I watched in the mirror and I for the first time in my life I felt that I loved myself woman reported that they started to apologize personally to men of their past or in their present life for things and said wow I did never imagine how much that was freeing myself I felt lighter and lighter and more and more self-love and many said I felt so empowered I felt so I felt my power as a woman for the first time so it was quite amazing process in yen why do you think that happened I think and it was the experience was far stronger than I expected to be honest I think we cannot truly love ourselves and we cannot truly empower ourselves truly access our natural power that we all have without also known in our shadow and taking responsibility for this part of our self and I think this is what happened I was amazing to experience that what do you hope men will get from watching us I hope they get the most air flow from it and I think men recovering in their self-love it's the only real drop that I need to get done if they want to get the job done but I don't see a deeper healing point or a deep deeper wound in the collective masculine soul then lack of self-love because they really didn't get an appreciating environment and if they restore a gram of real self-love they will treat women like goddesses they don't have a problem with hating women they have a problem with loving themselves people won't act like the good beings that they are when we treat them like shit the more we criticize men the more we just misuse our right to criticise them to belittle them if we keep doing that we directly lead to more hating of women more misogyny more more rape culture we lead to more of it and we know it we know it from psychology we know it from pedagogic we know it from teachers we know it from trauma therapy we just don't use what we know one of the main criticisms of the film is the idea of a collective apology saying that you can't apologize for someone else so you could apologize for your own stuff but not apologize for all women for example which is very true of course I cannot apologize for anyone else I cannot take responsibility for anyone else for sure and yet I think it's not so easy to make a difference between collective and personal and individual there is no collective if not expressed through the individual and as we are social creatures there is no individual without the collective and I want can give an example for myself I have found myself many times being thinking and or talking in a quite judgmental ways about man when I heard myself speaking these words these words coming out of my mouth I hurt my mother talked I hurt my grandmother talked I hurt my great grandmother I shall talk so I realized it's not only my own experiences in my own hurt it's a learned pattern already it's out of the herd of farmer women so how can you really different how can you really make a difference between the two levels and what is surprised you most about the reaction to the film yeah we have not spoken of the men's negative reactions yet and that is an answer to that question because that surprised me most not that there might be negative reactions but I have learned thanks to the reactions to the film about the men's rights movement and and going their own way movement I had not heard of that before you took could you expect who do you say what some of the comments were exactly the directions were for example sorry ladies it's too late I will never trust you again or this is all not true you have been paid for it or you're doing this only to manipulate us again so a lot of mistrust some all say I'm just just hateful it shows to me how deep man rules are and in the first place it was painful to get these reactions to a message that came out of my heart that was meant really that is mentor he honestly it was painful in the first place in the second place I thought wow it's it's amazing that it comes up that it becomes visible because it's so important that shows how important this message is and how important the work is how important healing is it and this wounding of man and of woman actually and there have been quite a few comments especially on the YouTube film of men saying exactly that sorry ladies it's too late or you're just trying to manipulate us again what was your reaction to that I say sorry as honest as I can do it today leave it or take it and it's interesting that in those comments especially from men it's like it's not good enough where I think but that's the best that I can give and this comment is hopefully not the best that you can give because there is a standard that I said and I don't I don't go down to this level of of hating and blaming so yes 100% of the mess between the sexes is in my hands and 100% is in your hands and I will never ever take 1% of your responsibility and say oh I am the bad one I'm not a bad one so it like what do you want to get rid of with this kind of sorry it's too late they don't even mean sorry it's it's even well sorry it's so cynic it's so it's uninteresting for me somehow what do you hope the film will achieve this peace and laugh and ecstasy for everybody and I think what I hope what this film effects is a deeper sense for both sexes of how complex this challenges and that we really have to do our homework everybody cries for the the one for the big laugh for the best relationship then do your fucking homework it will hurt of course my hope is that we can truly do a step into a new dialogue and co-creation where women start to say I love being a woman again and a man can say I love being a man and we all can say we love being humans I I dream of a time where we can truly allow ourselves to love again and that is impossible without allowing ourselves to be vulnerable [Music] you [Music]
