Jamie wheel has made it his life's mission to crack the code of human potential he's the best-selling author of stealing fire and director of the flow Genome Project which looks at how to harness the magic of flow states those moments of being in the zone where we go beyond ourselves I've always been interested in sort of the esoteric and the places where the sort of the mainstream meets the alternative and what your book did really really well was sort of reframed that as the cutting edge which I thought was fascinating yeah that was a very that was a deliberate decision we made which was rather than saying hey esoteric techniques have some scientific validation now we said hey red bull extreme athletes and special operations military guys are using it and this is their secret sauce and so we deliberately smuggled in esoterica into you know undeniable heat performers that have a sort of a mainstream marketability and kind of halo effect and then say well if they're doing it you know maybe you could maybe you could you know wrap your head around it - mmm because in a way this is kind of like you say stealing fire is referencing the idea that Prometheus steals fire from the gods this is an eternal thing something this is something that happens throughout culture can you explain that yeah I mean I know you don't presume to have an answer on it but it does seem that anytime people pursue and cultivate and propagate ecstatic technologies just everything anything that raises energy levels enthusiasm inspiration all the way to transcendent and non-ordinary states via everything from dance and music to psychedelics or substances sexuality even charismatic transmission you know a specific person or something that can sort of light other people that and almost never ends well mhm and and so that recurring battle or dialectic between the sort of the priests that give the keepers of society and and inspiration and the Prometheans the folks looking to steal it and put it out there for the masses that just feels like a back-and-forth battle that's been going on for ages and and so why that is is a whole you know that would be a life's work of inquiry my sense is this just it's a it's an unstable element you know that The Ecstatic is not designed to build houses with it's designed to burn them down and so that that very thing that makes it so magnetic and say what peeling also renders it very volatile and then the other is just all the human stuff you know then when people latch on to this stuff I mean sex drugs money power you know they all become places where we stumble as we try to bring this into culture and it's very hard as the old lord acton you know absolute power corrupts absolutely yeah the one ring and and it's not just hobbits by the way they're interested in that thing so so I'd say that mean that's that's a broad brush but we can we can we can start with that but you also say in the book that you think this for the first time it could end better than it has in the past yeah and I just don't know I mean I mean I wrote that somewhat optimistically two and a half years ago and then had an increasingly and increasingly disillusioning series of experiences with the psychedelic polyamorous Burning Man community let's say so so let's just say the intersection of sex drugs rock and roll and and and libertarian ideals and realize that those poor bastards can't get out of their own way to even just build something like cryptocurrency so so my concern these days is that we are out of bullets like we've tapped we have stolen fire from the gods who who we have absolutely taken ambrosia from Olympus and a meaning well just meaning the collective sort of you know quote unquote transformational culture and that's everything from EDM and transformational festivals to the Burning Man world to Silicon Valley high-tech space to psychedelic therapies to I would say anything other than just sort of MBSR mindfulness so sort of actual mindfulness mindfulness practice is this some teeth and are actually still trying to get to non jewel states not just help work he's alleviate their stress and not calling sick so often and that we have access to the most potent aggregation of transformational tools and technologies that any humans anywhere on this planet have ever had and we're still crawling up our own asses into narcissistic feedback loops so so for me the analogy these days is you know particularly I mean well I would say sort of psychedelic Gnosticism is creating the same way over prescription of antibiotics created super flus we are sort of over prescribing ecstatic techniques and creating super egos so instead of eclipsing our senses of ourselves there are this you know 5% left and then you stop taking the medicine and then they come back stronger than ever and so now we have people thinking that they are the second coming things that they do have a hotline to divine intelligence think they know they do presume to say what the universe is about and how it operates thing they can in fact sell and sell workshops and enroll you know punters online to follow them around so so we've ended up with a very problematic late stage issue which I never would have seen coming which is the resurgence of egoic virulence in the midst of transcendent technologies I actually posted something on Facebook the other day that Jordan Pearson has said which was psychedelics can give you too much responsibility than you know what to deal with yeah and I mean even just phrase it that way implies that you're aware of the weight of it and the responsibility of it I think a lot of people James Fadiman the fellow who is the pioneer of micro dosing that he was on Tim Ferriss his podcast and he used the analogy of overexposing film and sort of you know let's say there's one exposure on a bit of celluloid and that's reality and then if you take a psychedelic that's another exposure so they said that bit of film has more information but if you keep doing if you do three four or five six times yes it has more information recorded on it but it's just a blurry mess and the ability to separate signal from noise or transcendence from imminence or what the hell do I do on Monday or am I still an asshole to my family those things get blurred out and so you know I think I think what Jordan Peterson is cautioning about is almost a fairly advanced and relatively mature stage which is that I've seen more than I can handle but I acknowledge both of those things and I'm and I feel the weight but but I think there's a whole degree of you know lowered levels of self-awareness where people are just getting lost in the fairy lights you know and there's sort of this cautions about that in a lot of mythological traditions you know whether it's sailors being seduced by the rapture of the deep and the mermaids and getting sort of going off to their doom or you know in the sort of English tradition the Celtic tradition that the fairy lights in the forest and being enchanted by them and wandering off into the woods never to be seen seen again or come back and what only seemed like a minute and it's a lifetime you know a way I think those are the kinds of the cautions that were facing and sort of freshly now I mean there was all the train wrecks of the sixties and all the cautionary tales about just following your bliss and doing that but we're coming back around to that point and going hey wait a tick you know there's baby more going on it's not just gonna be instant instant liberation for all yeah this is again fits very much with what I'm saying at the moment it's like we're we're in another level of enthusiasm about psychedelic science for example I've I've done stories about psychedelic science and as far as I can tell most of the people who've done stories about psychedelic science so far enthusiasts because those are the journalists who are following these stories they're the ones who are interested in it and so what you're actually seeing is a very one-sided again and one-sided tale of psychedelic science which is not showing the dangers that you can that they can create as well like psychedelics for example the the the kind of metaphor or the paradigm at the moment is that you could do a couple of psychedelic sessions and overcome your depression whereas actually what you generally do is a couple of psychic sessions may just overwhelm you with the stuff that you haven't dealt with for example so it's kind of this idea of the psychedelics as a magic pill it's kind of now coming back in the culture which just seems completely but we haven't learned anything from the 60s yeah and it's been couched in the terms of better than Prozac which it clearly is but but certainly not a panacea I mean so in addition to the sort of psychedelic superflous idea I also wrestle with the notion of the sort of Assam the asymptote problem you know the idea that and we know and we report on these as well you know the two to three episodes with therapeutic interventions and structured environments have these amazing and life-saving impacts for people suffering trauma and depression and and end-of-life issues and yet you know what happens when you take it from 3 to 33 and people now levitating are they demigods or they yoda is no they're not they're just candy flipping ravers and so where where is the you know where is the ROI and where should we actually say that's probably enough and and my sense is is that their problem there is highlighted and you know there's a degree of sort of libertarian enthusiasm everyone should have access these have been repressed and controlled for a long time and now we're finally kind of coming out of the Dark Ages or coming out of prohibition this is a renaissance and I think there's a whole bunch of reasons to be enthusiastic and hopeful about that and hat tip to maps and the folks that have been leading that charge long slow difficult work Robin cohort Harris or all the folks that are really doing the disciplined legwork for the rest of us and I'm almost you know I'm sort of sort of telegraphing ahead a few years and I'm taking a stand probably now and increasingly clearly on regulation and restriction and that in fact there's probably 10% of the population that should never touch the things there's probably only 10% of the population the ditch that should encounter them more than 1 to 3 times in a lifetime and there's a huge fat part of the bell curve that we should re-establish rites of passage so imagine if and you know and obviously we know that confirmations and bar mitzvahs and all these things have just basically fallen flat and we end up with a bunch of rudderless humans wandering in between chapters of life whether that's boomerang kids in their 20s or empty nesters or midlife crises or whatever they are you know or women and aging into their crow and use whatever it would be we have shitty or non-existent rites of passage and what would it be like to simply program yeah three to five there's a coming-of-age one where you go from child to man or woman and that's who knows maybe that's a full visionary psychedelic you know that could be a you know a bluesy and mystery stuff and I loose it in the end only sitting in mysteries like this is the nature of the world welcome to it and then perhaps there could be a marriage one in that you know you could you could calibrate the compounds or substances that are most appropriate so clearly some form of MDMA therapeutic communion could be a beautiful thing this is the essential nature of your love together you know there could be something either at death or in preparing for death or another you know life transitions but in general my sense is if we're gonna try and play the long game with this stuff and integrate it back into culture there were no indigenous cultures that were just gloves off how about it kids and that's how we're doing it these days and and so there's actually this in fact I don't know if you've come across Richard reg Lee's stuff out of officer and he wrote a really cool book called essential substances and it was basically an anthropological was basically like you've all her re on acid I'm sure was it was essential substances through all of human history and culture but there was a tribe from New Guinea who basically had nine levels of initiation and it started with ginger so there were three levels of ginger and then three levels of tobacco and then three levels of mushrooms and each level became fewer and fewer people invited into that level until by the ninth level which was the highest octane psychedelic mushrooms basically whatever visions came out of that was a literally equivalent of like a PhD and the spiritual practice of their culture but whatever came through in those visions was then considered living scripture and added to the equivalent of the Bible so rather than burning those fuckers at the stake like the Christian tradition did like no no no no one gets to have any more insights they was a living tradition but it was also hierarchical and selective so once you're introduced into a substance at the level you were initiated you had free free range and accidents but you weren't allowed to jump the gun and try stuff that you had no business trying yet and so when we see the advent of DMT and five Meo DMT and all these absolute paint peeling entheogens being dabbled in by absolutely clueless twits I think that that's you know that was from be good lessons for us because let's actually start putting some structures back in the place versus just saying this gonna be a free-for-all that works out well cuz they tend not to so it sounds like you've gone on a real journey since releasing stealing fire to where you're at now well in what way what were you curious about you you said you're you're less enthusiastic about the potential of is it only of the potential of psychedelics or of your views change in any other way ah shit man me look at the look at the vim half groupie phenomenon I mean people don't know what to do with that stuff a good friend of ours has actually been what's the run responsible for bringing him into you know high end neuroscience labs and the first place it was like half of this is bullshit how this works he doesn't know which is which and you've got all these folks and plunging themselves into inflatable kiddie pools just to feel something just to feel high so you can throw in respiration you can throw in any form of quote-unquote conscious sexuality the pub the polyamory movement which is you know everything from sex at dawn to God knows what I mean the varying books you know even a stair peral's work which she's coming from a very ground at their pubic space but sort of gives permission for more expansive and exploratory sexuality that there's a lot of that that's wildly problematic so really I would say anytime you have a a persistent and an efficacious technique of ecstasy abstracted from cultural conditions and prohibitions thou shalt and thou shalt not see is how to use this powerful tool we end up with shit shows and now we're in depth with intersectional shit shows so you throw in as I said sort of a you know polyamorous state seeking psychedelic friendly Burning Man or transformational festival culture which is sort of around the world at this point no boundaries nobody tells me what to do so it's antinomian there is nothing I bow down to and and and in fact and there's and there's not necessarily higher good than my personal fulfillment in this moment and and that create as long as I engage in nonviolent communication as long as I share my feelings and state my needs all that stuff then it should all be fine right and and I'm also not sure that is and I'm also not sure that again back to asymptotes that the this might be kind of share the idea or like 80/20 woke to broke is that is pursuing that last 20% of your supposed enlightenment or fulfillment or personal growth actually becomes highly narcissistic and almost unconscionable when you think that that's gonna take 80% you get you know you get 80% of the return for your initial 20% of your investment in personal growth I would advocate listening at least is a thought experiment but people don't stop there they get hooked on the catharsis they get hooked on the x-star says they get hooked on the community arts they like bio it feels so good to break down and break through it feels so awesome to touch the Sun and it feels so amazing to be around my brothers and such as my tribe you know and so and and yet they'll then spend 80% more time effort money resources chasing the chasing the uncatchable of their own completion and some story or tale that when I get there I will be free from pain I will be free from insecurity anxiety you know poverty you name it I will be whole and life will be perfect it's like now fuck you that's not how life works and in the meantime you're blowing 80% of those energy credits on yourself when you already know enough I said what you got to do and there's people drowning behind you so lifting those folks up is going to provide infinitely more net good than polishing and you know polishing the last little corner you know on your statue there is also the sense that that polishing the last little corner is actually an illusion that's not human we're trying to transcend being human and we can't transcend being human exactly so they can embrace it and that's where spiritual teachers like Pema Chodron you know Tibetan Buddhist who's very much into I mean we even ended a bit of stealing fire with that you know there's a crack and everything and and embracing our humanity embracing the messy and perfections of this and it's not I mean you should have I'm hesitant to say the other half of the sentence because it becomes so glib but the idea of like therein lies the actual route to wholeness and realization it's not continuing to climb the mountain it's that it's the you know Zen exciting parable like returning you know to the village with helping hands and the idea that it's all still about me and my process and my journey you know sort of fuck your journey and I think that that kind of loving and backhand is something that this extended movement needs much more of which is if you're not if you're not making the world materially better and if you're not serving harder done by folks than you then Instagram photos of your hashtag blessed life you know you can just fuck off with them because that's not there's never been the point and the only humans that have ever had access to these tools and techniques have generally been within Marshall and monastic traditions and there's always been a code and an ethics and and a point as to why you would even have access to them in the first place and I mean a lot of this sounds quite Jordan Peterson asked what's your attitude Jordan Peterson yeah I mean I'm glad he's out there and I think that you know I mean I think at a minimum there's sort of three different jordan Peterson's you know there's Jordan Peterson the analyst and academic which actually nobody ever heard of there's Jordan Peterson the kind of contrary and public intellectual which sort of you know kicked off in 2016 and then there's sort of Jordan Peterson sort of raw shot and a lot for the culture wars which both left and right wildly distort who he is what he's saying and what it and what it means for them and so we get we get the the second and the third ones completely mixed although the first one you know University of Toronto and hop near former Harvard professors the one that gives the credibility and the weight to the other two dialogues so in that respect I think as I what I imagined him to be as an actual man is a pretty high integrity principled person who likes to think for himself and likes to speak not just truth to power but but also likes to remind his audience whether it's students or broader than that what what is you know what is it what is the life well a good life well lived and now there I think there are there are problems in how in the age of soundbites and hundreds of hours of footage and tons of speaking and those kind of things that become problematic and I'm not in any way convinced that if i sat down with him and said hey mate what about this bit that he would actually stand a defendant but impressions I get would be that is I think he sometimes over catastrophize is the slippery slope to Marxism in the sense that that all that you know this way lies Stalinist death camps therefore we cannot give one inch on concessions to progressive ideals or agendas although having said that I have also personally experienced the almost Chinese Communists like Tom Zeng struggle sessions of political correctness in in the Academy and in its kind of left-wing you know left coast idea so it's not that I don't see the peril I do I just think sometimes he uses the slippery slope argument maybe I think it pulls it out just sometimes a little early there's the bottom line without necessarily enough conditions to justify it he sometimes in my experience I think I remember him on Joe Rogan doing the life is nasty brutish and short the kind of Hobbesian it's always been this way therefore any efforts to try and recalibrate or rebalance the scales are fundamentally flawed delusional and by the way lead to the Stalinist death camps without any more nuanced socio-political critique of practices and policies so for instance concentration of wealth and the 1% and even the percentage of 1% has been directly traceable in at least in the US over you know tax and tax and corporate law various various deliberate policies that are fundamentally different in the 70s and 80s and have now resulted in an incredible skewing an aggregation of wealth in the hands of the few for him to skip over that and go to lobsters and serotonin feels like skipping some critical steps and also skipping some critical places of potential responsibility let's think there's a couple more there would be another one would just be where it where is his insight coming from and so we talking to you when you were describing hey you almost sound a little bit like Jordan pieces I mean in the sense of yeah I mean if I had to describe my worldview in a nutshell it would be sort of a Neoplatonic so there was a mere platonic stoic mystic Crist agnostic so the idea of Neoplatonic i believe i have always just sort of felt like there is a a realm of ideal forms stoic do the suck it up fat kid and do the hard thing hundred percent gnostic there is a certain ineffable experience of being and then the mystic Christic is some some reflection on the judeo-christian Western tradition but nothing to do with 2,000 years of bureaucratic administration and everything to do with what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos and Chronos the intersection of kind of sacred and profane time in human form so in that respect yeah I would track with with Peterson my sense is for me my you know gnosis or understanding has come from X ptosis has come from peak experiences and my sense for him at least as he shares what he does of his life has come from catharsis has come from the suffering it's come from battling depression it's come from staring the abyss in the face versus the view from the summit and those are ideally come full circle and reinforce each other but if I had to sort of delineate maybe where is his transmission anchoring from it's maybe a little bit more the staring the abyss and and and surviving it then then calling up coordinates from the mountaintop interesting and I guess you've seen the whole intellectual darkweb concepts or just grow and become kind of mainstream yeah I mean that we interestingly the the glitch in the matrix document show put out was subtitled intellectual dark web Jordan Peterson and the mainstream media two months ago and then the New York Times did a profile on it and then we published something said that said the intellectual dart web is dead because did yeah because as soon as the New York Times published i publicize or something on it then there is no intellectual diet web it is now mainstream so I was actually in the process of kind of putting together an intellectual dark web documentary and then off the back of that we kind of had a thought about it and realized that for me the intellectual dark web so you've got kind of like Dave Rubin the Weinsteins Ben chip Oh Jordan Peterson then I realized I was sort of starting to think about what is a deeper resolution like that that seems to me like a really important stage of surfacing this kind of level of conversation an integral conversation or something on that's emerging naturally and then we came up with a concept of the intellectual deep web so what are the and what are the knowledge what is the knowledge that that needs to be integrated and I came up with names like Stan Grof Richard tarnis and I would also add your work into that what do you what do you think about that as an idea of there are thinkers who've been who've been doing really great work do you know Richard Hannes yeah we've been doing really great work on the fringes of our culture for an awfully long time and I personally I think these are the people we need to integrate to get us through the next five ten years yeah I mean that's a neat distinction you're making I think I just read a piece in box I think this morning which was basically it was felt a little snarky and it was basically saying that the internet was response to the New York Times piece you know is basically saying oh the intellectual dark web were just a bunch of embittered losers on the on the outs and and and effectively they've been marginalized by the people who should have marginalize them and they're really just angry because they've been they've been sort of knocked off their perch or denied a platform and that's just I mean I don't know I mean I bet we can do actually and a data analysis of this my sense of Jordan of Sam Harris of these guys is not that they are embittered and on the outside banging on the door they've just done done on an end run and their actual reaches infinitely greater then I mean just retweets views clicks likes shares you name it any any social static my sense is that their reach is is exploding massively know that they've been sort of shut out from the chattering classes so I think there's there a very there are and back to the Rorschach blot idea there was the sense of these guys are saying saying the unconscionable and should be shunned so the intellectual deep web is I mean it doesn't quite have the mystery of the dark web but but as far as like the distinctions of content I think it's really neat and we are we kind of saw this in the 2016 election both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did an runs around the Democratic and DNC in the RNC and they said if we can reach our people via our own distributed economic platforms we are no longer the holdin to the donor class we were no longer beholding to established and entrenched you know political platforms and choice-making and we can just and we can make we can amplify via the democratic system our impact and i reach and you see that with musical artists these days you see that in email even with yoga teachers if you've got a big following on Instagram and you don't need to kowtow to some lineage which you know has lots of problems as well because all of the vetting of the light web you know if the establishment did have a solid degree of quality control to it so you tended not to get absolute howling ly bad or irresponsible folks showing up in that space but you also missed a shit ton of innovation so you know to your query of is is the access to the intellectual deep web something that is going to be helpful in guiding our way forward my my I so I would I would go as far as saying that would be like my only hope for a kind of glorious of a revolution of us is a bloody reign of terror if we can simply if the people and the ideas and then the actions can just do an end run around the established balances of power and again you know but it would be an example like what is that true progressive centrist who is you know socially progressive and fiscally conservative and internationally I wouldn't say pacifist but certainly just ethical and globally concerned with interconnected issues like climate like refugees excetera how many people would sign up for that I think a lot I think a lot I don't think there would be a just forget third party candidates you would just end up with an uprising and the two existing parties would be left you know holding their dicks so the question becomes how do we do more of that and and how do we and how do we provide enough of a clarion call that people can reorient around those things you talked in your talk before it sounded quite pessimistic or almost quite apocalyptic about what might be about to come are you you pessimistic or optimistic hmm I would say I am highly pessimistic of human culture and optimistic of human nature and that's Browder that's about as precise as I can get because if I if you if you run the maps and models and you see I mean the thing that blows me away about identity politics these days is you know we have some things to do people and if we quibbling and scrapping before we even get to the starting line of the race for our lives what's fucked and so you know as of last summer I went from well I mean that was soon of you know the steaming fire just come out there was all sorts of interesting companies conversations and that kind of thing and then I would say I had a fairly you know not dare I say it was my equivalent of my red pilling where I was like okay whoa I thought that generally everybody left of white identity politics was fundamentally a sound and solid human being we're all run in the same direction and realized oh no you can actually be kneecapped with a degree of virulence and spite and entitlement from the left that shouldn't by all accounts live there and it seems to be so in that respect I literally went from oh we're going to save the world via blockchain and distributed and decentralized autonomous organizations yay whoo just that was close to no no no even those fuckers can't figure it out either and I should dig the well in my new house in the mountains 400 feet deep not 200 feet deep and definitely let's get a tesla powerwall and be off the grid so mentally that's where I've been which doesn't mean I'm not going to keep fighting the good fight it means I'm absolutely planning the rearguard action and the lifeboats for the people I care about the most so I can stay engaged to the last possible minute and what do you think of the either ideas or thinkers or practices that we need to integrate to get through the next sort of 5-10 years mm-hmm gosh well I mean I think you know the simplest is to say we need a lot of credible thoughtful voices from significantly different points of view and perspective so I don't always agree with Sam errors but I appreciate he's out there and I appreciate he thinks the way he thinks I don't always agree with Jordan pieces I don't always agree with you of all her art but I like the fact that they're doing their thing so I think that there's a significant component of that that we just need a bunch of credible thoughtful informed people bringing their voices as skillfully and visibly to the problems at hand as we possibly can I feel I mean again to just restate Pema Chodron some folks like her of her ilk people who are expressing the human condition not as an infinite escalator of successes and perfect abilities but hey here we are this is this is this is blending heaven and earth you know and and this is what it means to be woken broke and can we celebrate that those are the kinds of things that leave me there's about I would say that's about the only place I feel hope I feel hope when people come together in their mortality in their humanity and then something beautiful happens so it's the true kind of redemption songs you know idea it's its gospel music it's those elements where we're like oh my god I was weeping last night but here we are giving praise here we are singing beautifully here we are dancing and clapping and stomping like that's kind of it and everything's Shia that to me feels either you know less deep than it might need to be or problematic you no matter how flashy or sexy it seems at the moment problematic and destined to fail at a later date with more consequences I get a sense that the journey we're going to have to go on is actually a much deeper one than just the intellectual one it's going to be like we all have to integrate and process and and and go through stuff I feel that we're almost inevitably going to have our own crisis points and need to work through stuff over the next few years what does that look like do you think I mean I think it's basically you can either use X tossus or we will be served up catharsis so it'll either be the peak experience that renders people to have a global centric perspective and then come down you know come down for the mountain with helping hands oh shit I got it I got the message and here's the work to do and I'm gonna conduct it with the agency that my long-range vision tells me is potentially prudent we ignore that that seems like most of us are including the people that are getting lots of time up at the top of the mountains if we ignore that then we will experience enough pain and lesser until that wakes us up instead and what degree of cultural collapse destruction tension needs to occur or will occur in order in order for us to get to that spot who knows but that's where I'm not wildly comfort like that's where I'm I would say at a minimum deeply concerned because um the notion that even the things that are potentially helping us these days like ecstatic techniques culture and practices unplugging nature retreat you name it I mean but the classic clichés is you know let's go to Costa Rica or Mexico or Nicaragua and do yoga and ayahuasca and and talk about our feelings and even unplug from our phones but even those things are being then sold commodified refracted through Instagram post and through social media and so even when people I mean I just read an article today on how basically Instagram culture is creating a huge spike in fatalities in Colorado's 14,000 foot Peaks because people are going there they're shooting Oh Here I am zooming along this knife rages this awesome ranch shot look at me I did it and then other people are de-risking the process and there's one mountain near Aspen where where five people died in six weeks and that's that's analogous that high territory which then seems safe and approachable is there's no different than hearing Joe Rogan on a podcast I mean how many CrossFit MMA guys you're now hitting DMT because they're like Joe said I said it was cool you know you're having these kinds of experiences and even the things that are potentially our salvation are becoming commodified refracted and distorted by the very tools we're you're trying to get away from with those new solutions so in that respect we've almost trashed ourselves up with no escape and that one baffles me you said you go to the top of the message or you saw you go to the top of the mountain you get the message what's the message I mean it's impossible to state it succinctly without it being cliche but I would say stay awake and build stuff you know and do the hard thing above all be kind that's Huxley's bit you know I mean that's more than enough to start with you did the end of your talk say that you thought we might get it together just in time yeah well funnily enough like that that's to me that that phrase actually was a little bit of an incantation so it's not even just in time like in the Nick kind of thing it's maybe in Chronos in linear mundane time and that we might get it together I suppose at that intersection of Kairos and Chronos you know that if we can anchor ourselves in that in sacred time we're past present and future are all Co arising and nothing needs to be done and we can have faith in the fact that in fact this does work out and I don't mean faith in the sort of sort of blind hope I mean like actual Gnostic in this you Tori certainty there we have seen how this all goes down and light prevails then then we can come back to our day-to-day lives and to me that you know you mentioned the loose Indian mystery is like to me if we could initiate or have as many people around the planet initiate themselves as possible into that knowing that hey this all works out all we need is 51% goodness truth and beauty over the long arc of this whole game it doesn't matter how dark the varying chapters get if we know we've we see in the resolution we've seen the redemption then we come back and we're like hey everybody it's all gonna work out we can exhale now that doesn't mean there's not hard shit it doesn't mean there's not critical shit and it doesn't mean there's not a my pot isn't absolutely and me to play it balls deep if you know because it's only 51% so I don't get to phone it in just because I saw how the film ends we're all required and and to me that's what I actually have hope in is that if if enough people can come to that realization then then we wake up and not in some bullshit evangelical megachurch kind of way of being born again but in in a truly initiatory way being born again of like I know my purpose I know my part and I'm willing to practice resurrection I'm willing to offer my life fully and freely in love in every moment and and if needs be in the face of injustice and if needs be in service of the things I cherish and and then we're invincible like then we can turn things on a dime if we do this incrementally if we get hung up around identity politics if we imagine that technological progressivism will save us at last man I think there's an all sorts of crumbs on that but if there is a chance to do it I you know ironically out of time in in that sacred space then we have a chance to do it in time you know well the clock is ticking yeah the people that I've found who've done the most or seem to have got at least far enough down the path those who've been through a sort of transformational community but the guy who as I who's our mentor guy called raffia was part of the Osho community for many years which was sort of experiment with all of these kind of transformational technologies but they were doing it within a community of people for two decades who were all refer who are all doing the same thing reflecting stuff back and it took it seems to have taken that level of intensity and reflection and shared purpose for them to have done the transformations that they have like they're almost know like it seems striking to me like how much work we've seemed to have to do to get to that place does that make sense like that sort of reflects back to what you were saying about sort of the psychedelic communities it's like it's not the it's not the transcendence it's the deep interpersonal work that we have to do of intense interpersonal with with communities like I think we have to build that kind of community yeah for sure and that you know the catharsis plus communitas is another cul-de-sac I mean we know a number of communities they're very deeply into raw intimate inter subjective communication and a everybody ends up banging everybody and there's tons of drama around that and then be everybody you know if I can just getting your lunch takes an hour and a half because everyone's sharing how they're feeling in the moment and you're like okay that too is a necessary but not sufficient criteria and and that sense of you know back to the 80/20 I think what traps so many of the people who are into process based communities is that they get the cathartic hit for the first you know they and that's 80% of the with their 20% investment but they hang on and they keep going back to ring the same bow and I mean the same that's like no of course we need to be able to be aware of our feelings and of course we need to be able to process stuff and stay as clear as possible and of course we sometimes need to check in with infinite sin absolutes just to make sure we're keeping time and then there's that element of integration and service yeah let's go slip the whole stay awake build stuff like if we're not if we're not doing those two things in concert then the just staying awake just becomes an exercise it's fiddling while Rome burns and if we're just building stuff but we've lost connection to the one then we might be we might build wonky lopsided stuff that doesn't doesn't stand the time
