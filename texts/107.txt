[Music] after the election of Trump in 2016 a blog post by deep code went viral in it the author explained what had taken the vast majority of the media by surprise it describes how the blue church mainstream consensus reality as mediated by the liberal media is being challenged by a new web-based insurgency the red religion that entire document I wrote in a day and it was actually what ended up happening was I was having a conversation with the friend of mine who said I don't understand what's going on and I as I was discussing with him what was going on it dawned on me that the frameworks that I had been developing for a long time that I some sass that Lee assumed were just obvious weren't obvious and so I expected maybe nine hundred people might read this and it might be helpful to five or six and that'd be cool and obviously it had more impact than that spread well pretty widely and so as it turns out it was of more value than I had anticipated Jordan green Hall says the channel for interview and the aftermath is another important moment in the collapse of the blue church narrative so during the interview we see an example of a delusional framework that is what appears to be largely incapable of perceiving and reacting to reality in real time but much more interesting is what happened afterwards which was the sort of the self-healing and policing mechanism of the larger social consensus of how when have a blue church reactively goes about maintaining the integrity of its frame do you mean when they tried to characterize it as sort of abusive trolls and you don't write hero and all of that exactly exactly what sort of a to use of a military language is a fallback position that was a reactive almost instinctual and not almost in fact precisely instinct she was that pure habit and so what ended up happening was there was a break in the frame there was a glitch of the matrix the mechanisms of the blue church reacted to endeavor to control the frame and to convert it into a way of sense of making sense of the what occurred that still maintained the integrity of its frame and that failed as well and so the the clash between what happened when the digital environment effectively completely controlled the frame and the broadcast environment effectively tried and failed to do so I think is could be well characterized as running into the wall I was a journalist in the Channel 4 News newsroom for about 10 years that's fun and then working making documentaries and I I guess I still got a lot of those similar kind of connections and ways of thinking and there seems to be in the mainstream media a sense that everything's gonna go back to normal Trump might get impeached or things it still feels like an interregnum and that reality will will reassert itself in some way do you think that's that's that's naive yes I think that's naive in fact I would even say that is delusional my diagnosis of what's actually happening is that people are moving further and further away from what is what thinking actually is and or more into merely running a script a legacy framework it used to be thinking but now it's just a framework for input-output responses to stimuli hmm this I think is what we thought happened in the interview with Jordan Peterson on Channel 4 News that you called the glitch in the matrix yeah right yes I get that could you explain what you think was going on there then yeah I think that if you imagine I'm gonna use some kind of more computational language but if you imagine a a very simple state machine that has pre predefined inputs and predefined outputs of how it responds to the world effectively that's what the journalist was running when she was running a very simple state machine it had a no capacity to actually perceive reality directly insert it could only select from a finite number of possible states of what was going on and so this is why we ended up with this bizarre where Petersen would say acts and then she would summarizes so you're saying something very much not X but this is because she had like a list of possible things that could be said hold on like it's just a finite list of possible things and so if you if you weren't saying something was in that list to all that she could do is select something from that list for which she had already a prefab set of possible responses so as a program in a very computational sense and and this is what happens when you begin to become delusional when you begin to move away from a fluid intelligence that is in fact perceiving reality and responding to reality in a fundamentally creative way into a functional intelligence which is selecting from a menu of prefab interpretative categories and executing on a program of prefab responses and I should mention that this is not this is not rare this is actually commonplace this is a natural these are both natural states of the width at the human mind responds to reality I mentioned the disc it's actually a fundamentally conservative principle that it sometimes it makes sense to have a fluid creative intelligence that is exploring reality this is expensive it's often has makes errors and it's not very effective at acting in the world let's call it play or exploration and sometimes it makes sense to just see something identified as being associated with things you know how to do well habits and then execute on those habits efficiently and then output the problem is when you don't have the ability to switch out of a habit mode into a creative mode and this is a particularly problematic situation when reality requires that you do that when when you're driving your car and something anomalous happens and instead of responding to the anomaly in reality you just keep running scripts you're gonna actually run into a wall at full speed as try as we might our desire to interpret reality to mean what we wanted to mean at the end of the day will always be checked against what reality actually is maybe sometime you know we're pretty good at making things up and pretending but eventually reality is reality the culture were the the 20th century was a decisive success for blue and a effectively a route for red so what we see first is that red was forced to move into a deeply exploratory phase second that it did this in a context where as it turns out things were changing meaningfully quite significantly in fact it from my perspective a in a world historical level the emergence of entirely new forms of communication and therefore entirely new forms of sense making and coherence it's not necessarily the case of those two things would have overlapped but they did and so in a context of a a blue church and blue faith hegemony and I should mention by the way we're particular the blue faith increasingly was it was utilizing its coercive authority over most of the collective intelligence channels media and education in particular to establish its dominance at the level of values and to extinguish red values putting an enormous amount of selective pressure on the the the groups that we're endeavoring to operate under red values and of course selective pressure either kills your it makes you very clever and so ended up happy news you've got a lot of exploration of different ways to survive and thrive under was it what we're changing conditions and that's that's I think the thing to be really focusing on you're imagining as I am that we are witnessing a transition we're witnessing a shift which is largely characterized by on the one hand legacy which has lots of power and inertia and energy behind it and and emergent which has the advantages of being closer to a shift in reality it's a ship a ship that has a lot of inertia that is in the process of trying to turn so the state is blue church but the rate is red insurgency or more specifically the actual underlying shipped in broadcast in digital so one of the things that we're witnessing or one of the things that we can use this event to make sense that is saying okay where are we on that trajectory what is the rate of change and how are the relationships between the inertia inertia power a coercive capacity of blue visa V the emergent capacity of red you can almost like imagine two lines in a graph okay where are we on that crossover so what I would say is this represents we're getting closer and closer to the point of crossover and that implies significant things across a number of different domains and we can then use that to make predictions about what's likely to happen in the future under different circumstances say for example I apologize any kind of event that emerges where there's a social need to make sense of what that event means for the purposes of then choosing how we're going to respond we can now predict that the capacity of the blue church to control the frame and impose sense-making on it is now below some threshold and that the emergent capacity of this new phenomenon to be able to control the frame and make sense of it is now above some threshold openness is creative experimentation the willingness to step away from habit and order and to take risks to see if any novelty happens to emerge that's a look of a deep value and it's the kind of value that is usually more common in the complex that shows up as blue hmm at a physiological level which is why it's a sort of an interesting paradox that blue I kind of got stuck in an ideology around openness rather than openness itself which also is probably the pathway to how it actually finds its way out of it actually that that's actually quite important if there's a way for the quote-unquote children who believe which is to say those beings humans who are able to fully connect with the underlying values in a way that is separate from and liberated from the constraints of both ideology and habit and then embody those values in a fully authentic way we'll discover that there is something that authentic thinking that is not the same thing as simulated openness there's a distinction between an actual open mind and the simulacra of open mind that is characteristic of the modern left you can grasp that and really embody that you will be more fully in connection with your actual values and by the way also no longer delusional and therefore an actual exponent when I'm calling the children of blue neither red nor blue as pure elements contain the ingredients necessary to actually be adaptive to reality this is a disaster in fact it's a little bit like separating the hand and the eye now you're the eye can see if the eye takes itself as being the essence of virtue it separates itself from the ability to do the same thing with the hand this is not a good thing and so and this is what I was calling in terms of purple there's hopefully wound up happening is that the values that are currently being held back by the blue church will separate themselves rediscover their actual values separated from their ideology and then in gather and engage in a an authentic exploration of these new modalities of collective intelligence and begin the process of forming some new collective intelligence in the process of doing that they will also rediscover their ability to form extremely effective alliances with the value structures that are currently largely showing up in red mmm usually incompatible far from it and for most of human history these groups have actually always co-mingled they're necessary that they actually relate to each other in a deeply healthy and direct fashion their separation into armed camps is extinction area actually so then will end up happening is that you'll see this what I called a Cambrian explosion because it will be extremely if you take the values of openness as a pure aspect they will explore quite openly they'll explore vigorously and they're effectively well the values of red that you think blue needs to integrate or to make or to reintegrate oh well that's actually pretty easy responsibility I mean we've actually even seen it the ability to make a commitment and keep it which which by the way ideologically shows up is either duty or loyalty but those are both ideologies the the deeper sense is that ability responsibility both of the individual in the group level the ability to actually really make a personal sacrifice on the part of the group that's actually a deeply read value and I don't mean that by the way as politically ideological certainly there are people who are currently part of blue who feel that deeply what I'm saying is that that shows up much much more intensely in red and when you're feeling it in blue you're actually feeling a red value and that's good mixing that's crucial because that's very jordan peterson esque - how would you how do you define jordan peterson or do you think the fact the issue is that he is is not definable within one of those two camps yeah I think that's the point I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of communication with other human beings and this is all about the notion of admixture that one must have a mixture of of whoa I mean he uses the mythopoetic to make sense the order order and chaos the way right the taoist way is the alchemical admixture of order and chaos and that's it like that's how you do it and so if you bias towards orderliness you find yourself in a rigid non adaptive non creative non exploratory framework which will die because the world changes if you bias towards chaos you you eat your young and evaporate which also ties for obvious reasons and the key is to actually enable these things to be in relationship with each other and vital healthy relationship with each other and I think that's in some sense the essence of what he's focused and instead of the core what he's acting about now it it does it seems to me that on the one hand he connects war hmm yeah it does it seems to me that he connects more closely with a lot of the values that would come out of read out of order lines at a personal level I certainly know that when I interact with his stuff when I perceive his videos I read his works the aspect of me that has that in it seems to be the part that is called out and connected like I can feel the aesthetic of say Sparta which is very sort of read as a as a metaphor moreso than Athens but not radically so and as a consequence I think this is also one of the reasons why his audience has begun to self-select for individuals for whom that is a yearning and a calling mm but that's not and and also I think because he's in an environment he perceives the chaos aspect has run amok and has locked out a lot of the orderliness stuff he's also presenting an antidote he's presenting a lot of more in the direction of orderliness and more in the direction of responsibilities because we're way off track on that front to get us back onto the way we're going to have to pick up a lot more of that to get us back in but it's not just that it's that's what is more needful now you said children of blue will will form their own collective intelligence as to fight back against this or to respond can you explain what you mean by that yeah in fact this is a good opportunity maybe to double click on it so the first thing is to is focusing on this fact that it is precisely because a set of values that were able to form an alliance in cohere in the late latter part of the 20th century and use the modalities of the 20th century media and collective intelligence landscape broadcast television broadcast in particular to win meaning that they were able to establish lish hegemony over the socio political control structures they have not yet been forced to adapt no straighforward you don't you don't choose to adapt if you don't have to and so because they actually have high quality or reasonably effective ways of trying to make sense of the world and in particular making choices and acting in the world they are still operating under old frameworks and have not had to and therefore have not endeavored to learn the new tools ok so this is what I characterize as the blue church and primarily the blue church problem that is that the the people the human beings who have particular kinds of values that are not fully compatible with what's going on in red and therefore I've not chosen to simply shift their their alliances and their energy and their attention into those domains are constrained by the fact that they're Earth's well allies broadly speaking are still largely stuck in the blue frameworks both in terms of institutional structures and in terms of sense making ideologies etc etc and as I mentioned these are increasingly delusional which is problematic because when you're in delusion you actually have a very hard time getting out of it and what advice would you give to people to to navigate this new world um well I mean I've given advice already I've said that it's keeps showing up and more that's the same thing the first is free your mind be aware of the fact that the habits of the blue church and and how it works don't work any more and so if it feels scary to step into a liminal space recognize that's ok that's what you need to do step into a liminal space recognize that your way of making sense in the world that used to work don't work and you really really need to set yourself free to begin learning a new child's mind beginner's mind second this by nature must in fact the exploratory so swim do not make sense prematurely in spite of the fact that the world feels dangerous inside of that you may want to protect yourself in this dangerous world doing so too quickly does not allow the natural exploratory approach to do what it needs to do really just listen and learn go all the way dad back down to human base turn it inward learn how fear shows up in you learn how not to allow fear to drive the choices that you make learn how to listen to the whole way that all of you perceives what's going on become more integrated with your own body go out into nature spend a lot of time not connected to the chaos that's going on and a lot of time reconnecting yourself with your fundamental capacity to perceive reality in all the different modalities that human beings have the capacity to do then relearn how to use other human beings as allies in figuring out how to make sense of the world I mean that really relearned like we have been abused and constrained by institutional frameworks that remove us from our own native capabilities so relearn that understand how to be a friend and an ally how to have a conversation with somebody where you're really listening closely to get a sense of what their perspective brings to you where you're not obligated to agree with them we are not obligated to move out of what you feel is right to form some new consensus reality but where you're actually authentically recognizing that their perspective has some capacity to bring richness to your perspective this by the way is almost exclusively possible in person and what we're doing right now is an OK version of it but we need to be very mindful the fact that linear broadcast is bad and even interactive bandwidth like this it's not good enough you know you've got to learn from raw physical and get yourself into places where your consensus reality and your habits are willfully destroyed human-to-human conversations and and get as far away from ideology as you can your job is not to know what the is going on your job is to be absolutely certain that you have no idea what the  is going on and learn how to feel from raw chaos from raw uncertainty oh then and only then are you finally able to begin the journey of beginning to form a collective intelligence in this new environment that's my advice great are you hopeful for the future I am as it turns out someone who seems to be relatively committed to endeavouring to do good things even under duress so it seems that I am intrinsically hopeful for the future even though at a rational analytic level I would say that I do not have I would not put the odds in our favor check the website for more great films such as the first full-length documentary on Jordan
