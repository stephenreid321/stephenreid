[Music] for a while I've kind of felt and especially with the eruption of me too and times up and all of these gender dynamics becoming really central to the culture it kind of feels like we're we're stuck in a dysfunctional relationship between men and women that is now manifesting everywhere and Warren you've you've done work with with relationships for an awfully long time do you see that parallel and if so what do we do about it yes we are we are definitely caught up in an in a dysfunctional relationship that would be kind men we know we're asking men to you know to sort of express their feelings recognizing that we're repressed we're so repressed that we're the sex that commit suicide and at a level of six times to 6 to 1 over women and when we're in our 20s and when we're 85 and older at 1,350 percent greater amount than women and if that's not dysfunctional then tell me what is no suicide is probably the ultimate so in order for us so we are wanting men to open up on the one hand and then we're saying don't mansplain you've dominated the conversation shut up this is time for women to speak up this is time for men to shut up so totally contradictory messages that men are getting told that they're filled with power and privilege and yet walking around in reality feeling shamed and fearful and that women have a type of power that they're not even allowed to talk about because they're the ones with the power and the monopoly over it so it's it's that is about as dysfunctional as it can get we have to understand that we have these attractions to each other for for fundamentally dysfunctional reasons we were never designed to be functional we were designed to survive and now we have the opportunity for the first time in human history to be functional as well as surviving and this is a whole new dialogue that needs to be together but though feminists have monopolized that dialogue of women good men bad women the oppressed men as the oppressors and that's about as dysfunctional as you can structure a dialogue it's as it's like a person going into their being saying I came here because you know my wife has filled with problems and and I have been telling her what to do for many years and she doesn't pay any attention to my direction and she's a 100% wrong on these 14 different items and I'd like you to help align with me to help you understand how wrong she is by the way if you do align with me I will continue hiring you as a therapist I control the money but if you don't align with me that'll be the end of you as a therapist and we're basically having feminists say to the world if you want to teach in gender studies you have this party ideology to follow you have to believe you have to articulate that men we live in a patriarchal world dominated by men that made rules to benefit men at the expense of women and if you don't follow that ideology there's not a chance in that you'll get a job at any decent university unless that ideology is at your forefront and you just have your own unique ways which we give you many unique ways no problem at all as long as you have unique ways of expressing that ideology as effectively as possible to your to your students and do not deviate from that or allow anyone else to come into this university to talk in a different way about that and so you cannot define it would be hard to write a novel with a fictional situation that would be more of a dysfunctional dialogue the the monologue then the monologue that is happening now well you know we've we used to have a battle of the sexes that's been historical but now we no longer have a battle of the sexes we have a war in which only one side has shown up the other side called men have put their heads in the sand and hope the bullets will miss that's a dysfunctional dialogue so what needs to happen to to get out of this we need to start communication training in first second third grade so that everybody knows how to listen to everyone so that the bully so we see in the bully his vulnerability or her vulnerability we see in the mean girl her vulnerability or his vote her vulnerability and we we have people share what they're about what their feelings are what their hurts are what their pains are and all come together to to do that this is already this is just a theory in Denmark they're doing this in younger grades and it's been very helpful in helping them have a much more constructive first second third grade but I believe we also need to do this not just in kindergarten first second third grade but we went but when our boys and girls are going through that process we need to have their parents go through it at the same time because if kids come home learning how to communicate to parents who do not know how to communicate they will have a lack of respect for their parents which will undermine their ability to follow their parents guidance and that will destabilize the family and so this has to all this is the number one agenda that needs to occur so that's step one step two is that men have to speak up men have to be willing to risk their careers as I certainly experienced myself doing when I started speaking up about these issues it was very clear to me that I lost my standing ovations that I used to have and the more I paid attention to the dialogues that were happening though the the discussions that were happening in the men's groups I formed by forms of 300 men's groups and you know that John Lennon was what you know joined one of them and and those were those were ways where men opened up and said what they felt in the safety of other men who were saying gee I didn't realize anybody else but me felt that and so but then when many of them and when I started to incorporate those what I heard in the men's groups when I started to incorporate men's pain and feelings into my presentations of two groups at colleges and universities I found myself going from very large standing ovations large audiences standing ovations and always being invited back to two or three more speaking engagements versus slowly all of that dwindled and I knew that if I continued speaking and incorporating men's feelings and fears that I would continue to have fewer and fewer speaking engagements and I had to make a decision you know did I want to have you know now that I saw the formula that I want to be formula speak and have a huge income and do very well and be very respected and and and applauded or did I want to go ahead and and try to discover my best truth and speak up about that and try to represent and incorporate men and while still retaining a compassion for women and and and make that part of my life and my my contribution and I decided at least I would try to incorporate the best truth that I could and that led to books like the myth of male power and you know that was that created a totally different paradigm for what the male/female relationship was about and questioned the whole concept of men having power redefined power is feeling obligated to earn money that somebody else said that the old definition of power feeling obligated to earn money that somebody else spent while he died sooner was not a good definition of power that power was really about controlling one's own life and historically speaking survival controlled our lives not human beings our parents and grandparents didn't talk about having Wrightson and they talked about not rights but they talked about responsibilities and obligations and when I decided to become an author my father just laughed and said you just cannot make a dependable living as an author that's not responsible and it wasn't until I got my third book advanced that he changed his mind and said okay you've proven yourself to be an exception to the rule but you know that's a rule don't encourage any of your kids to become an artist or an author because they just won't be able to resupport a family on that Robert Bly talked about a father thirst in our culture that we're all thirsty for this energy and in a way you can look at the success of Jordan Peterson as this great need for that archetypal father figure kind of offering discipline offering rules for life offering meaning offering purpose and your work the boy crisis very much looks at what boys in particular lacking does I guess that what what do you think boys are lacking from this absence of the father well boys are lacking purpose we have a purpose void and then we have a purpose void combined with a dad void that has left boys in an extremely precarious place by a purpose void it used to be that we had to sense of two ways of having purpose in the past to be a potential warrior we would be called hero if we were risking our lives to die and or we would wear the sole breadwinner in a matter what type of personality we had if we were to be a man we not only had to raise enough money to support ourselves but to support our wives and in the 19 and in the 19th century it was often 10 children my father was one of 10 children and he was expected to his father was expected to support you know 11 people actually 12 people himself his wife and in all 10 children and so that's a huge amount of economic pressure to take jobs that are not fulfilling but jobs that are oftentimes deadening so that you can earn that type of money and so and so now when we have this purpose void and we have a dad void there is debt that the boys without fathers do have a father thirst and and they don't know where to go especially in a world where the culture isn't saying to them well you have two places to go you can be a you can you'll be disposable as a warrior or you can be you know do something you may not want to do to in order to support be the sole breadwinner for your family not to worry okay I don't have a father he died in war or whatever but at least I have the culture telling me I have to clear senses of purpose not true anymore and it's good that we have a purpose void for boys it's just terrible that we have a purpose void for boys at a time that we don't have that the ability of we oftentimes and many families don't have a father to direct male testosterone toward a constructive purpose because when male testosterone is not directed toward a constructive purpose it ends up being directed toward a disruptive purpose and it's a very powerful force so I now know as a result of the research for the boy crisis that boys who that if we look at all Isis recruits almost all the Isis recruits have in common one thing they are either boys or girls who don't have a significant amount of father involvement when we look at the school shooters or the mass shooters they are almost all boys who don't have a significant amount of father involvement when we look at prisoners we know that the only women's centers that we have in the United States we though we have many we know that we have many women's centers in the United States but we also feel like you know where are the men's centers and we do have men's centers they're called prisons and the prisons are filled with about 93 percent males but what we don't know is that very almost the common denominator of those males is lack of father involvement I just checked this out with the chief judge of the Superior Court of Washington DC and he told me and the other family court judges told me that in fact is well over 90 percent of the people in prison who are males are males without significant father involvement and so I discovered in just a hundred different ways that when children don't have their fathers they have significant amounts of problems but boys in particular have a greater amount of problems because they don't have a role model they don't have a way to find themselves as a male we often do rite of passage programs but rite of passage is only a minimal substitute for the real rite of passage which is a father everyday interacting with his child to learn when to take risks when not to take risks when to be assertive when does a certain us become aggressiveness the this happens from everyday roughhousing with dads where does say no that went too far you can't do that if you if you could continue to push your sister around your brother around there'll be no more roughhousing it comes from dads enforcing the boundaries they set that no more roughhousing means no more roughhouse it comes from dad's not taking that boundary and that punishment too far it means it means no more roughhousing until tomorrow night but you so you'll have no more pleasure tonight and more excitement tonight if you because you bullied or you pushed your sister your brother but we'll help we'll continue it tomorrow night but in the meantime here's the thing five things you need to do you need to get your teeth brushed you need to get finish your homework you need to do something else and then we'll have more reading time or some other type of time together and so we need to understand that children both boys and girls need to bond with their dads dads and dads are very good at creating a bond through the excitement of things like roughhousing they are very good about helping children be trusted to go out of their comfort zone if a boy or girl comes home from school and says you know mrs. Moyers hates me you know let's let's I don't want to be involved in her with her class anymore and moms will tend to say sweetie I don't want you to have a bad experience in education at a very young age because it could be fundamental so I'll go in and talk to mrs. Jones the principal about transferring you from mrs. Moyes class to mrs. whoever calls class and so the and so but whereas Dad is more likely to say sweetie you know you've got to learn to get along with people that you don't that don't like you and that you don't like so what can we do to talk to you know what would mrs. Moyers say about you and what is heart what are her complaints about you and and then you know the boy is encouraged to talk about taking accountability and responsibility and moving through to another level and getting out of his comfort zone as opposed to having his because his comfort zone catered to these are these and about 10 other examples like this of our different the differences in dads style parenting that need to be combined with the best of mom style parenting so that the the protection and the nurturance and the unconditional manifestations of love that mothers tend to give are very important to creating the security blankets of children but it's also important in creating the security blankets of children that children be guided out of their comfort zone not just during a rite of passage but during every day of their life with consistency that helps them know that that my dad is pushing me yes but my dad is there for me he's pushing me because he loves me he has an unconditional love also it's differently manifested than mom's unconditional love and his unconditional love is not giving unconditional approval but giving approval and disapproval but when we when we do things that are related to a healthy masculinity rather than a toxic masculinity or a healthy femininity not using my social skills as a girl to be able to manipulate or my attractiveness as a girl to be able to manipulate a boy into doing something for me that he wouldn't do out of his own interest except for the fact that he believes that I'll have a relationship with me or sex with me and I see how vulnerable he is in this area that's an example of toxic femininity and if Ana father can help a girl through that process as well you talk with jordan peterson about about this what do you make because for me his success signifies how much we're thirsting for this father energy in our culture what do you make of jordan peterson what do you make of the jordan Peterson phenomena you know I think first of all I would not have predicted it so I don't want to I I think maybe I'm often called and among my among my people who agree with me I'm called a visionary and but I was not a visionary and for seeing Jordan Peterson I think it's amazing that an intellectual that is young in who is you know who speaks in terms of often of metaphor and an allegory that he has risen to such extraordinary success and I think it is in part a result of our enormous hunger we you know we have we have attached to two extremely unlikely figures because it our hunger the Donald Trump on the one hand and Jordan Peter said on the other two ends of the extreme in terms of somebody who's been willing is say you know fathers are important families are important and so Jordan and I found ourselves in a hour-and-a-half dialogue in which I would give a you know I would talk about fathers and roughhousing and he would talk about some intellectual Piaget or someone else who was you know who was in the literature or in Disney movies or something else that related to that and it was just a fascinating hour-and-a-half I I think because you know I'm usually when I'm being interviewed I don't learn a great deal but I certainly learned it was wonderful the way we learned from each other and you know in our workshops what we work a lot with is men owning their shadow owning the fact that we have an aggressive side we have there is a predatory element to male sexuality all of this sort of stuff and integrating it understanding accepting and integrating it and this this to me at least sort of points away potentially through the dynamics that were seeing at the moment to be able to accept the shadow side of masculinity and then stand in in in in our own power as men there's much less talk in that in our culture about the shadow side of femininity the shadow side of women and that seems really unbalanced yes absolutely and that's exactly in my opinion accurate we're talking about the I just spoke at a conference called a wellness conference and Idaho and many many of the presentations were on the the divine female but there were no presentations on the male of the female shadow or the you know the the less than divine well if you will and yet there is a huge amount of cultural conversation on the and the male shadow which we aren't even gentle enough to call the shadow when you hear the word male shadow that implies men who are being introspective about integrating the shadow side of themselves into the rest of themselves and and having an acceptance of that and and are trying to become holistic as men but when you hear the statements about male privilege and male power that comes from a political ideological place that really doesn't allow and that you and those men go into college and they can't speak up without calling it being told oh you're just mansplaining so we're telling the boys and men on the one hand share your feelings and then the moment men share their feelings they go your mansplaining and that's sort of like excuse me what did I hear and certainly you know a guy that's in class in college and that is being sharing his his heart and his pain and his shame and his and his shadow side openly and he notices that women withdraw from him in the class but if he had an interest in taking somebody out and asking somebody out in the classroom that that would be that would undermine his ability to be successful in making that contact so we have a huge amount of problem and so what I said before about we've taken a magnifying glass we've taken our binoculars and we've used our binoculars to look at women's experience of powerlessness and women's experience of male power but we haven't looked at men's experience of powerlessness and men's experience of female power that's a problem we're looking only at one side of the equation and we've done that for a half a century and it's so important that the conversation become more balanced male/female dynamics are an evolutionary tango in which every time you change any part of the dance you have to look at both sides of that dance changing women do not worship men who are expressing their feelings and they're they're going to you know they're the first signs of what women are interested in is the cheerleader is cheering for the football player which the the the the the foot the cheerleaders are saying hit him again hit him again harder harder or first and ten do it again then first and ten do it again is first and ten a concussion again first thing at 10:00 risk a dislocated shoulder spinal cord injury again because if you take that piece of leather a hundred yards in a car and it goes you go across into the gully into the end zone we will like you more we will love you more boys are getting the message that girls like them and love them when they risk their bodies because that's historically and evolutionary preparation for them risking their bodies as firefighters as in the military being disposable we have we haven't had no conversation about the pressure on boys and men to be disposable what I call the social bribes as social bribes from fathers from mothers from from women from men to be willing to be if you go to war and you serve in the military or you're an elite Navy SEAL that you will be called a hero if you are the the male who is willing to die as a volunteer firefighter you're getting no pay economically all of your pay is the social bribe of respect of honor of women being more attracted to you and your firefighting uniform and that is your pay but you have to realize that that pay is a social bribe for you to be disposable so that women and other men can be protected it's one thing for you to understand that as your social bribe to be disposable it's another thing to allow yourself to have that cold male power and privilege when in fact it's male disposability I'd love to hear you kind of summarize where you came from I think you've got a really interesting perspective having been part of the women's movement and and then you're you're now kind of seen as the father of the men's movement yes yeah it's ironic I start yes yeah and I did start out when I was doing my doctorate at New York University the women's I was teaching at Rutgers University at the time and when the women's movement surfaced I started incorporating that into my political science curriculum as a political movement and my advisors and I was also doing my doctoral dissertation at the time and so the students and at Rutgers were saying man when you speak about the women's movement you got fire in your belly and yeah you should think you know what are you doing your dissertation on and I said what I was doing it on which was a different part of politics and they said you should think about doing it on something about the women's movement so I went to my to my Advisory Committee and they said oh you know Warren you don't want to sort of like demean yourself with taking on some little fad that's going to be going away in a few years and I said I don't think this is a fair that's going to be going away I think this is a an evolutionary shift where women are beginning to speak up and say the old gender roles of the past were too rigid we're more than just a role and I think that this is going to have implications for both women and men however I do agree that it's a lot of hostility toward men and you know and it may take a little bit longer to catch on among men and so they said if you really want to go for it but that got me deeply involved and then that led to my being elected to the board of directors of the National Organization for Women in New York City and then I got reelected for a few years after that and so I spoke all around the world on women's issues the importance of women's issues and why any secure man should be a supporter of women being having more flexible roles and and also the importance of this for men and for men to be a part of this process and this was a place where Betty Ford Ann and I agreed very strongly Betty Ford and ended up writing us a book called second-stage that didn't get nearly as much publicity as the as the feminine mystique but when she did that she said that the second stage of the women's movement needed to be men having more flexible roles as well and this she and I had discussed this and many times and we both strongly agreed that this is where it needed to go unfortunately the women's movement started moving in a direction that was much less male friendly in the and the key turning point in my relationship with now in New York City was that the many women who were divorced we're writing into the board and saying I don't like your whole equality policy because that means that men and women have equal rights to the children after divorce when in fact I know what's best for my children the mothers would say and so if I want to marry a new man start a new life move out of the state and keep my children away from the father I should be allowed to do that and I said whoa you're talking about females doing what is best for them without asking what is best for the children and so I started doing some research on this and I said from what I can tell it looks like the children do best when they have about an equal amount of mother and father involvement after divorce and unless we find out otherwise that should be where we stand the fact that that was the the point that you kind of found yourself in conflict with links very much into the book that you've now your new book which is the effect that that has often on boys what led me to doing the boy crisis was as I was speaking around the country when when why men are the way they are it got translated into a lot of languages and as did the myth of male power and that led me to speaking in countries like Japan and Germany and Australia New Zealand etc and in many of those countries after my talks teachers would say you know I'm seeing something happen in my classroom the boys are really struggling a lot and they're falling a lot behind girls and in my particular school you know both of the valedictorian of the salutatorian and most of the Honor Society of the equivalent thereof is almost 70 80 % girls and so that alerted me to something is happening here my sister was a teacher she said the same thing and so I know this was yes quite a while ago this is back in the 70s I began to hear about this maybe even in the 80s 70s and 80s divorces were happening in large numbers and I was beginning to see and my sister and other people would say you know a lots of times when the families break up the the the the kids that are otherwise doing well especially the boys seemed to really fall-off in motivation and attitude and send withdraw and but those were all just pieces of information but I began to feel like there was something there to that so the first thing I noticed was that the boy crisis was happening when the United Nations authorized a study called pasa of tests that were being done of children and in the largest developed nations and in the less developed nations well when I sorted out the 63 nations the largest developed nations all the developed nations had boys falling significantly behind girls and almost all of their academic subjects so I started asking why and looked at the fact that developed nations had permission for two things to happen one was for there to be a divorces and for women to be able to usually in most countries the women had more priority if they said that there was any challenge with the man or most judges wanted the children to be involved with both parents but if a woman objected to that most judges were afraid to go against the woman's objection because if the woman says she was afraid of the man and any one thing happened at any point in the future the judges career could be in jeopardy and so most judges heard in the in the direction of protecting the mom from the you know any possible undesirability of the father so that was happening in the divorce area and then a huge thing was happening in throughout most of the world in the developed world which was that as the world as the developed nations had less preoccupation with survival they gave more permission to women for women to have children without being devout being married and in that group I noticed that there was a huge divide also as there was in the divorce be people the the mother so in the United States to be very clear 53 percent of women under 30 who have children have children without being married now marriage to per se is not a big thing from my perspective but it turns out to be a huge thing in terms of the possibility the probability that children will have contact with their dads in unmarried when women have children without being married there's a relatively small chance that those children will have long term contact with their fathers and so I was beginning to see this enormous gap between children that had had contact with their fathers that was that were consistent and that was significant and children that did not and the children that had a lot of contact with their fathers even if they were in divorced families or they were unmarried families that small percentage of children that did have good contact with their fathers did quite well not as well as it an intact family but close to it and then conversely the children that had minimal or no contact with their fathers were doing terribly as a rule and more than that I was altum Utley able to research that to them for the boy crisis book to the point where I was able to identify seventy different ways that children do so much worse with their fathers this is true of girls and boys but it was more true of boys the intensity level and the degree of and the numbers of areas were greater with the boys why a boy is affected more than girls I think the number one reason is that when a girl has a single mom she has a role model when a boy has no a single mom he does not have a role model as to how to be a male second the culture has given girls much more many more options recently they a girl who's married can and having a child she has the option to be to work full-time to be involved with the children full-time or to do some combination of both and we're you know the the since the feminist movement has occurred one of the good things that's happened for women and girls is that we say be whoever you want to be but we don't say to boys you know when the children arrive you you and your wife should discuss who will be the primary parent and you have as much right to be and expect and expectation to be the primary parent as the mom does for the most for the most part the young male who's married who's about to have to be a father says you know I have three options to I can you know work full-time or I can work full-time or I can work full-time and and there are certainly an increased percentage of dads who are full-time dads but it's really still about nine eight ten percent depending on the country and the and that and and among those men is a much greater likelihood of divorce if the man doesn't do something at home that produces money so long story short the the the great majority of single mothers do not have boys that see a great deal of their father's and the boy doesn't have the old senses of purpose and the in the old days there used to be if up you were a boy the culture told you you have two options you can be a warrior and be a hero and be respected by us and you could be a sole breadwinner and so you knew that you had to march to one of those two tunes or both of those choose tunes be a warrior or sole breadwinner now we need many fewer warriors and we need women are sharing the bread with this the bread winning role so a man doesn't have to define himself as a man by being a sole breadwinner and yet at the same time if he's not a sole breadwinner there's a challenge there as well so a boy has to sort out what do I want to be if there's there's a purpose void in the culture for boys there's not a purpose void in the culture for girls there's multiple purposes for girls and so a boy without a father and with a purpose void has a purpose void combined with a dad void and the dad void and the purpose void put together our disasters for a boy because a dad whose constructive and involved is a dad who can channel the testosterone toward two things helping his son say what's your unique characteristics my sweet man and then secondly no matter what your unique characteristics are and no matter what fulfills you you have to also be responsible for earning income so you have to balance this sense of fulfillment which I want to support just but just make sure that you know that the more fulfilling a job is the less it's likely to pay and so therefore when you do a fulfilling job don't neglect don't just say oh I can do anything I want to do because most women won't be interested in you and you will not feel you're producing for the family and and contributing in a in an honest way and so you've got to combine this but combining being fulfilled with producing responsible income that can help produce support both yourself and share the support of your children that's a tough combination and without a father figure there to help a a move through that pit is very challenging whereas girls have the support of both the culture they don't have a purpose void they have an expansion of purpose and they have a female role model which the for her being growing up as a as a productive woman the boy does not have a male role model and so that's one of the those are two of the major reasons that boys fall so far behind girls I also teach men's work and what's interesting is there's a lot in the culture at the moment around kind of me too and times up and male behavior really acting men really acting out but there's another side to it as well I mean what I often see from the men coming to the workshops that we're doing is a sense of shame around themselves as men of castration of internalized yeah internalized shame around themselves exactly hashtag me to is wonderful up to a point it's wonderful in the sense that we want women to speak up and say where they're where they've been offended where they've been hurt where they've been misused the a necessary speech set of feelings excellent and there's more to men and women than women only there is men and women are men as well as women they're boys as well as girls I talk in the boy crisis I quote a real life you know slam poem from a fellow named Royce man and he goes you know I am walking on the street and I see in front of me a woman who looks back at me and she sees that I am behind her so she crosses the street to the other side and then I discover how I should be a man how I should what is it is to be a man is I am a person who is yes I'll be a father yes I'll be a brother but I'll also be an attacker what am i as a man I am mostly and at an attacker I am mostly an attacker what shame is built into that and that went viral and that went viral because so many males identify with that shame and so many women say yes that's what you should feel you should feel that sense of humbleness to the point of shame at representing and being a white male and when you go to college if you express these feelings of powerlessness understand this is a time for women to speak up this is a time for men to shut up so you have white male privilege so shut up that's not a good way to bring a man into society as a healthy man now look I look at Trump for example and I sense that we're so starving for genuine male qualities that people have elected what is effectively a facsimile of these strong male qualities as president does that scan for you yeah yes or no I was I was an adviser to four advisors from the Clinton pain and it was a strong supporter of her effort to become president and and I kept saying to the advisors that that there's two major things happening in this country one is that boys are having significant problems and that no one is articulating that and and that if you Hillary speak up about boys problems no feminist is going to leave you because you're speaking about boys problems because they're alternative is Donald Trump that's the last thing a feminist wants to vote for so you can speak up about these problems and with political safety and with political enhancement because you can because people who are moderate Republicans and our parents and are having a dysfunctional son who's a failure to launch will say my goodness somebody cares about my son and most people care more about their children than they care about a political label and so the know this is completely safe for you to do she could not do that secondly she I said there's it's working-class families that are having that are there are not okay with so much focus being on LGBTQ and so little focus being on the struggles that they're dealing with when they you know when they've been trained as a coal miner and they've lost their their coal jobs they need to be empathize with and then they need to know that there's going to be a transition that you will help install to move them from their olds levels of security to new levels of security and it is not just the men who care about this because most of these men are heterosexuals they're married to women who are dependent on them for their income and said if you don't pay attention to them their wives also feel threatened and sure enough 52% of non African American women have vote voted for Trump and so I feel like that the emphasis of the Democratic Party in terms of closing out discussions on on family values on the value of fathers the demon is the combination of the demonization of men and the undervaluing of the family led men and women who loved men and boys who were having problems with not being seen heard and not having any place to go and what they what they found was some man who was probably the most who was probably the best personification of the immature shadow of masculinity that we could possibly dig up and have go anywhere and in and that spoke with that type of anger and honesty and and honesty is one of his good traits his own perception of honesty and spoke up without fear which is one of his good traits being able to speak up about things other people that are unwilling to say and they heard in him not just a political way of being but an emotional way of being that mimicked their way of shouting out and making things crystal clear black and white and being so sure and so solid about that that they ended up supporting his attitude even though his attitude much much about him contradicted what their Christian values are contradicted with their values of being modest and and not being a bracket there are parts I've read some media coverage which kind of paints you as the patron saint of the men's rights activists and angry and regressive troglodyte all of those kind of all of those words are kind of lodged in your direction what what do you make of that why do you think that happens and how do you how do you respond yes I almost never had somebody read the myth of male power and say this is an angry book and I've never had it's rare that somebody I don't think I've had a single person read the boy crisis book and say this is an angry book where this doesn't work to put help men and women understand each other I and I have maybe spoken a thousand times in a thousand places I have had that one demonstration that but only one in a thousand you know speaking engagements and the and and I don't I don't know no one said during that demonstration I read the myth of male power carefully you know I even read it and this is the problems I have with it let's sit down and have a dialogue about it and at the same time so since I believe in taking responsibility I have allowed myself to defend and be associated with people in the men's rights movement such as Paul Elam and and even though I disagree with much of the content of what they say the very fact that I'm willing to say listen hear them behind every angry face is somebody who once heard and then it's listened to has their anger dilute diluted so if you want to not just be angry at the angry people or hate the hate the haters you know instead of being like them be open to what they're saying they all we all have a truth to speak and so that has allowed me to be associated with as as opposed to just rejecting the messages but I think that personality wise I tend to be at the up you know I tend to be not like the Valerie Solanas of society for cutting up men author feminists and at the same time not like the the the men's rights movement people who are make tau people who are saying I have to go my own way it's a hopeless Society I'm here speaking today and around the world all the time because I still do have hope although I think we are as you said in a very dysfunctional relationship so I feel like a therapist in a very dysfunctional relationship where one of the people in the relationship is accusing me of being on there and the others on the wrong side their spouses side you
