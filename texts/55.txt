[Music] in 1991 Richard tarnis released the passion of the Western mind a vast history of Western thought it became an unexpected bestseller in it he argued that Western skepticism and materialism had been a heroic project but had also created an intellectual prison and that it was creating a crisis 27 years on where are we in that process in terms of where we are historically and in this moment of history I think we're at a very pivotal place very volatile very uncertain and all of these qualities are very characteristic of this threshold of the death rebirth process because you have to have an uncertain outcome you have to have the conviction of uncertainty for such a transformation to actually be successful you you have to really feel that everything is at stake and it might not work out for the the moral transformation to take place you can't we all know how what people who have a near-death experience tend to come out of it with a rather rather radical change of their life philosophy it has a more potent effect in like five seconds than almost anything else you can have and but you can't have a pretend near-death experience for it to have that kind of moral spiritual psychological transformation you really have to feel everything's at stake and the result is uncertain and that's just how we're experiencing it today only on a collective scale the everything that Joseph Campbell described as the initiative experience like the the the crisis of meaning the being isolated from the rest of the community the the sense of facing one's own mortality the the personal suffering the the you know the the deconstruction of the old identity or you like that an old self is dying everything that I just described which is happening on the personal level in an initiation is what's happening on the collective level to our human civilization except it's now we're looking at planetary mortality rather than just as an individual person's mortality and we're looking at reconstructing reconceiving the death of it we're having to go through a dying of our whole identity about how who we are relative to the nature who we are relative to the cosmos and are we really living in a disenchanted cosmos in which were the only intelligent spiritual being in town or are we embedded in an in sold universe of inconceivable depth and mystery and intelligence in of which we are an expression we were we are the cosmos in human form and it's that that happens in the state of spiritual rebirth that we reconnect to the sense that that we are we are cosmic beings and we're also participating in something much bigger than us so we simultaneously are humbled by the experience but also exalted by reconnecting to the hole that has infused through us so I think we're at a very dicey place right now where the question is will enough people individuals go through this kind of profound inner transformation an inner work inner journey to be able to go through what is basically a kind of symbolic spiritual death so that we don't have to do it literally and we've already set in motion destructive forces and some of those forces are are you know already affecting the world and probably are going to continue and the question is will the kind of near-death experience that we are kind of going through in sort of slow motion right now be sufficient to catalyze enough of a psycho spiritual transformation in enough people that those people can serve as centers of insight and equilibrium so to inform the whole in a way it it doesn't take everybody to do this but it takes enough people who are able to their sensibility and their transformation can ripple out you know through through the kind of work that you you you do with your organization and with the with the kinds of access that we have through podcasts and and things that aren't being put on the mainstream channels of television or even taught in the universities I think that can ripple out enough where if enough individuals are carrying that transformation it can actually help catalyze a larger transformation in the collective because it's at just such moments of instability that that kind of chaotic disequilibrium can suddenly reconfigure in a new way in ways that are not possible when it's not so volatile so that's that's my fervent hope and maybe I'll just end this with the idea that hope itself can play a role I think to have hope and faith in the darkness is very important and in some sense it's only in dark periods that that you develop faith and hope with everything's just light and glorious and hunky-dory you don't develop those muscles you it's something that happens on in challenging times and that develops the the moral spiritual fiber that we need and hope is one of those virtues of that I think cultivating that it will be very important I read passion of the Western mind at university back in 93 94 and I'd say it probably had the most impact of anything I've ever read as a kind of map of the history of Western thinking we're the kind of the bind that we've got ourselves into in terms of Western philosophy and we're how we might get out of it and for me a lot of what you wrote about then still feels very very current it still seemed like a very accurate description of where we are and what we were going through I'm assuming that we've got a fairly big audience at the moment a lot of them have come to us through Jordan Peterson and the interesting thing for me about Jordan Peterson and the IDW intellectual dark web movement seems to be that the Internet is facilitating a kind of intellectual awakening there's a lot of people devouring young they're devouring a lot of kind of very deep philosophical material through through the doorway of Jordan Peterson which is really exciting and in as rebel wisdom what we're trying to do is to to really examine some of these huge ideas and say what are the ideas that have been sort of maybe on the fringes of our culture you could say Young is kind of on the fringes of our culture and we've always been sort of out there in the New Age and hugely influential thinker but but certainly not part of the mainstream and I'd argue that you are one of those thinkers as well hugely influential in many different areas but but never kind of part of the mainstream I'd love if you could just introduce yourself and tell me a little bit about your your background life story and in two minutes I was born in Geneva Switzerland of American parents that grew up in in the United States and I was educated up through high school by by Jesuits and and nuns before that and kind of got a pretty solid grounding in in you know at Greek and Latin and the classics and and that it kind of imbued in the appreciation for for the the cultural intellectual spiritual legacy of the West and so I was kind of putting together all these different you know attempting to integrate these different influences and then I heard about Esalen Institute in California when I was there which in California I when I was still at Harvard is where I first heard about it and it sounded like a place where in a sense then the new a new horizon was opening up of thinkers teachers practical also putting into practice what these new ideas were that were being drawn from many different sources from shamanic traditions from ancient mystical Asian traditions from Western esotericism as well as contemporary psychological practices their therapeutic so yeah for people who don't know what s elinoz s alone is now pretty much universally recognized as the sort of the granddaddy of the human potential movement right and Mother Church of the human potential movement it was called in those years yeah you can say you've got a Buddha behind you so we're in a were in a kind of New Age book shop and Esalen was sort of seen as the a place where a lot of Eastern traditions came in but what's really fascinating about your work is that you have a huge respect for an understanding of the Western tradition as well I drank deeply from the wisdom of the east and at a certain point it's in night in my 20s I realized that it wasn't an East versus West thing and in fact there was a great deal of wisdom and depth in the West that I I I was informed by and I felt that in my generations desire to kind of wipe the slate clean overthrow the the the oppressive ideas and structures of my of our parents and previous generations that we were cutting ourselves off from from our own historical legacy from our from our ancestry and and that that would be a kind of mutilation and that what we needed to do was to retrieve what was profound in that tradition while also keeping a clear eye for the shadow of that tradition which we tended to be unconscious of in the promotion of whether it was progress or monotheistic judeo-christian religious thought and so I was always trying to kind of keep hold that that tension of opposites as Jung would say the importance of holding multiple values that can be in tension with each other and if you can not prematurely fall into one or the other and and then demonize the other or some on negate it but if you can hold faithfully that tension then there seems to be something in the natural unfolding of the human psyche and of life that moves towards a creative synthesis of what is being kind of loyally held as as as opposites in tension and that that's pretty much what I did and what I sought to do and and so passion Western 9 was one example of that even to the point of also seeking to do that with ideas about the masculine and the feminine as well mmm-hmm to to recognize that there's something deep going on in in our time that needs needs addressing involving the involving gender but also involving the archetypal dimension behind gender you you mentioned synthesis there and that's really what excites me about the potential of this moment for for intellectual synthesis you you start the epilogue to passion of the west of mine with a quote from Robert Bellah which i think is a really profound quote and what may be sort of bring up on the screen I try to remember it's something like we may be seeing the the reintegration of consciousness that will be not on the basis of any single understanding of reality but the understand that we need to move between different languages different different scientific and imaginative vocabularies and and the idea of not ever falling into the illusion that one particular interpretation of reality is reality itself but being constantly open to the fact that we are always speaking you know symbolically metaphorically about about a mystery and and so we have to keep a kind of humility a kind of epistemological modesty as we approach the mystery of things and and Robert dalla who I deeply valued as a as a friend and a teacher his great book religion and human evolution that he finished just before he died 14-year project just a magnificent work anyway Bela really carried that he wrote that in 1969 and and it is a beautiful rendering of our need to hold a a plurality of perspectives as and and not fall into some single literal understanding the reason I brought up the Robert Bellah quote is that I I see some parallels with this intellectual dark web that's arisen Jordan Peterson what why I sort of got very deeply into Jordan Peterson was recognizing that he represents a real synthesis he uses the Jungian model but he also links it to the evolutionary model he uses evolutionary biology uses psychology he uses developmental psychology Jean Piaget to talk about the evolution of morality and synthesizes many different ways of looking at the world and then you have within the the same IDW constellation someone like Brett Weinstein who is a very very deep evolutionary biologist who maps on what he understands to what Peterson understand and says yes there's that there's a real here he actually told me all all true maps must converge so this sort of sense that there is the potential for all of these different maps moving towards a similar point I I wonder and I'm hopeful that this great intellectual awakening could be the time of that of that great intellectual synthesis yes you know I think it has to happen but because there is so much I mean on the one hand anybody with a with a good contemporary you know modern early postmodern education had sees the unmistakable value of of you know evolutionary Sciences of of the sciences generally etc but if they are sufficiently broad-minded and curious and open haven't been shut down inside into a into an a narrow perspective they they recognize that statistics and mechanistic scientific explanations do not capture the full experience of human reality and anybody that does deep inner inner inner work or journeys or sacred medicine rituals or an LSD experience will have a glimpse that there is something more as William James would put a capital s capital M something more than is explicable by our by our philosophies as you know Shakespeare's there are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in our philosophy so I think we we we have these what can be warring sides and it within all of us I think of it within the West in particular as a conflict between the Enlightenment with its rationalist of scientific loyalties its its allegiance to the modern mind you might say and romanticism in the broad sense that goes right up to the psychedelic counterculture of the 60s ensler which is which the modern soul is loyal to as it were if we can make that distinction and we all have that in our in our being we all we all have romanticism and the Enlightenment as essential to who we are but there's something about the way the modern worldview emerged in which the the rationalist scientific enlightenment more or less has the center of gravity for understanding the external physical natural world and the while romanticism is what speaks to our souls where we where we we read our poetry we take seriously we're moved by our music we take seriously the the artistic epiphanies that open up to us a deeper view of reality we we appreciate the the spiritual experiences we have when we are walking through a redwood forest or watching a sunset over the over the ocean the these are precious to us in ways that can't be explained by a reductionist scientific view so we have both of these loyalties within us and until we have that some deep reconnecting between this the inner and the outer as it were between mind and soul or between the Enlightenment and romanticism also between east and west also we could say between north and south if we bring in that idea of the you know the the larger range of of cultures and and cultural traditions that are carried in the in the two northern southern hemispheres and how important that integration is for our future and then finally between the human being and the and the rest of the of the Earth's community that that separation has been catastrophic and that separation has roots in in both the Western scientific and religious tradition in complex ways so there's a number of fundamental healings of of these schisms or bifurcations these these polarities that the future of our of our species really depends on I think moving into a in integration and you you have a really beautiful way of describing that we we have attempted to purge ourselves of any anthropomorphic projections towards the world but what we've all turned on has created the ultimate and morphic projection would you like to explain what what kind of as an overview what is the situation we find ourselves in and then what that synthesis might look like it's a great paradox because I think we can see how the the modern mind from you know Descartes and bacon and Locke onward were very much focused on moving out of an anthropocentric point of view and you can actually see obviously the Copernican revolution is seen as being like the the ERM moment the the primal transformation out of an assumed cosmology in which the earth is the center and therefore this is seen that the human being is as the center of cosmic design as it were and and then suddenly we're a spinning moving planet one amongst many and then there turns out there's billions of Suns in a galaxy that itself is one of billions of galaxies so you have just this sequence of breaking out of the anthropocentric perspective this is kind of how the story would be told you see and and until we become seen as being radically peripheral and part of that movement towards cleansing our perception of anthropocentric assumptions is to believe that only the human being is capable of meaning and purpose and if you if you think that the world outside the human being is carrying meaning and purpose as for example when a synchronicity happens and there's some some powerful seems as if life has conspired to suddenly bring together a coincidence of such uncanny meaning - - on that you that it it kind of shifts your consciousness of like wow there's something going on here that's mysterious and the the the mainstream sceptical point of view on this would be if you think that's the case then you're projecting what is basically a human meaning onto the nonhuman world and that's a basic epistemological error it's childish thinking it's it's it suggests delusions of self reference and if you do a lot of that we may recommend that you see a psychiatrist and and perhaps have medication and behind this sequence of thinking is the conviction that only the human being is a locus of attention intention agency spirit soul purposeful conscious intelligence and that the world itself apart from the human is or perhaps a few of the more complex higher mammals and birds that aside from that really human beings are the exclusive locus of conscious purposeful intelligence and the world apart from the human is unconscious purposeless and meaningless and that only human beings have to find value and meaning that can through the development of their rational capacities and so forth which he'd like into a kind of mental prison that we've made for ourselves yes but it was a liberating move at first mmm because the because it was an attempt to break out of a particular cosmology ideology that had become very confining it what was the word used fatalistic yes that you that human beings were not in control of their own destiny that either the the cosmos or nature or a transcendent God was determining our reality and we needed to break out of that and just see that human beings had to define their own reality so it's very empowering to have that assumption but in cleansing the the perception of of any potential anthropocentric and anthropomorphic projections onto nature we fell into a trap because that too is a kind of assumption as Rupert Sheldrake says the assumption that the world is a machine and that we are the one conscious purposeful intelligence presumes that that the that the machine is something that is found in a state of nature but in fact the machine is just something created by human beings natures of much more mysterious phenomenon and in many ways I'll just make two points on this one is that the assumption that only human beings are capable of meaning and purpose is an enormous inflation of the human beings as if we have taken all the potential meaning and purpose that was seen but by every other culture before the modern as pervading nature the cosmos the earth animals plants the heavens it's as if like a vacuum cleaner we've sucked that all up and locate really relocated it inside the human cranium and and claim this for ourselves alone which is a rather remarkable act of human hubris if you step back and look at it from that point of view and the the corollary of that is if you look at the pride that modern take about we are the first ones that recognize that the earth is moving we are not the center of the universe etcetera why is it that indigenous cultures who weren't aware of the moving tend to be much less anthropocentric in their practice of life than modern civilization which has been so anthropocentric that it's that it's crashing the biosphere with its industrialized exploitation of the natural environment and and radical upsetting of the of the ecological balances to the point that we have catalyzed mass extinctions and and melting of polar ice caps and extreme climate events that are are really causing you know tremendous hardship for many species including our own most vulnerable members of our own species so there's been a great price that has been played paid for the hubris of this appropriation of all meaning and purpose into the human being in the effort to free ourselves of anthropocentric assumptions it's one of those paradoxes the the the unforeseen consequences of good intentions that characterize history because that's the other thing about the The Passion of the Western mind it as you said before it's a very much a two sided story there's a sense of this kind of great Apollonian project to free ourselves from nature that is that is a very positive project in many ways but also there is a shadow side to it as well in terms of how much it's cut ourselves off from a lot of from nature itself obviously but also from some of our own inner knowing and this sort of rationality and I guess you you alluded to sort of masculine and feminine before which is a one way of looking at it sort of the intuition versus of the rationality what do you think this synthesis because you you you talk about the potential for synthesis especially in the epilogue to passion of the Western mind what do you think the synthesis looks like what do we need to recognize and what we need to integrate well I've spoken of a number of the kinds of synthesis I have in mind well between you'd say between mind and heart also between mind and body to get in touch with our by our our bodies really are one way of putting it is that we we need to recognize that all the faculties that we have as human beings are necessary for us to cultivate to be able to to adequately register the richness of of reality that a kind of narrow-minded almost puritanical rationality and narrow empiricism that doesn't pay attention to the breadth of human experience for example but is is very quantitatively limited then to that extent we are going to be really cut off from our from the full range of of what reality is about we're going to be locked up in a kind of prison that could could be very destructive as we're seeing in practice because a little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing and a lot of knowledge from a very narrow perspective which is what I would argue is the mainstream epistemology can be a catastrophic lead ange er esteem I would say so one integration is of all these different we need our relational intelligence our emotional intelligence our the full range of the imaginative and intuitive capacities are our somatic intelligence kinesthetic aesthetic how important beauty is for for illuminating what is important in in life and deep beauty not shallow beauty and to be able to recognize what is deep or what is shallow these are these are kind of educational goals as it were that I think we are our educational systems need to integrate into and cultivate in in our in our students so that we just don't all end up as kind of technicians working with dashboard knowledge as Olin Barfield put it could I address one point that you mentioned about the rationality and intuition and it's connection to feminine and masculine or masculine feminine I've I've gone through of course I'm aware of jordan Peterson's number of comments he's made along along the line of what's what's feminine and once masculine and core he's drawing on among other things certain things that Jung wrote Carl Gustav Jung and in that epilogue of passion of the Western I also talked about at the at the very end the idea that we we have had a very masculine dominated civilization that profoundly needs to reconnect with the feminine ground of being with all that has been separated differentiated from and in many ways a you know oppressed suppressed in the effort to create this kind of powerful autonomous intelligent advancing species which had the name in English as in other languages with the patriarchal word man you know it's been man this you know the ascent of man the dignity of man man's conquest of space and things like that it's that that way of summing up the whole the whole human being as as masculine with that image be speaks a a profound you know separation from so much of what it is to be human but since I wrote that epilogue which was you know no 30 years ago I have had thought a lot more about the somewhat simple you know complex but still in some way simplified drama that I painted in those last pages of the of the epilogue and I've come to realize and this is partly you know here I live in in San Francisco working with graduate students the last 20 30 years and very in touch with with with with feminism with various postmodern movements that are kind of opening up our sense of gender and all sorts of assumptions in patriarchy etc and and there have been critiques within the Jungian world for example of the what is the feminine and what is the masculine and also within feminism itself there have been conflicts between different schools and as a result of this a number of us have been developing a perspective that builds on Jung's great insight because he did he made very big breakthroughs in recognizing the dignity of women's women and women's psychology and also what men have cut off from themselves that is causing them to become soulless but at the same time he was carrying certain patriarchal assumptions that go way back and I mean he culture he came from was very patriarchal and he still had ideas about what was natural for a woman woman's place was still pretty much in the home even though he was calling on them to develop their masculine side of rationality and capacity for assertion and calling on men to develop their feminine side of intuition of feeling relationality and so forth but as soon as we assign rationality to one gender over another and feeling or caring the capacity to carry into one gender or another we're doing something that isn't quite fair to the complexity of those of every human being and so what has been emerging a group of young'uns feminists contemporary thinkers and I have been developing this idea of there being a both a lunar and a solar form of the masculine and a lunar and the solar form of the feminine so that the the solar masculine is the kind of patriarchal ID ideal or a stereotype but there is a lunar masculine that when a when a when a father is holding his child tenderly and and supporting his wife to go out into the world and to be an independent person as while still being in intimate relationship that is his that's not just him cultivating his feminine side it's a part of his manhood that he's that he's caring that he's in touch with his emotions that he's capable of relationality and to to assign rationality just to him and that the only way a woman can connect to rationality is to develop her her inner man in some sense impoverishes the the full depth and breadth of what it is to be a woman and the same thing conversely for a man so we've been using this more nuanced language that recognizes that basically men certainly need to develop their their their lunar side the the side that is capable of being in touch with their their feelings their relational capacities their emotional intelligence their intuitive abilities to comprehend the whole beyond kind of analytic reason and that's that's part of their wholeness that definitely needs to be integrated and the same thing for for women's development of their capacity for autonomy for for a kind of a very through the public life not just the private for rational assertion in the world and so forth that all these are I think it it's a little too simplistic to put it all into terms of the masculine and the feminine even though we're saying that the that both are in both of us because you can never really say anything about the feminine without thinking about women and the master without thinking about men and even in really wonderful young'uns like people who I greatly regard women young'uns like Mary Ann Woodman who just passed away or they they will talk about the feminine in one sentence about the feminine in all of us and then in the next sentence the feminine is talking about female psychology and they haven't noted that they went from one meaning to the other because it's an unconscious conflation so we're just trying to come up with more precise ways of showing the rich nuance within all of us and I think that Jordan Peterson may at times find himself it getting more intense blowback from people who are hearing what seems like slightly stereotypical assertions about what it is to be feminine what it is to be masculine and and if we enrich our vocabulary objec a bit we can see that while women certainly have of a kind of great special relationship as it were to this you know lunar dimension of life the ruler of the night sky the connection to soil depth etc and then conversely with the with the solar but to limit it to them and you can use that language the feminine and unless the masculine is still keeps perpetuating a kind of patriarchal bifurcation you mentioned Jordan Peterson what do you make of the Jordan Peterson phenomena I gave you my kind of take on it before I think your work has been very helpful in showing the the the value of what Jordan Peterson is doing while also recognizing that you know he's he it's not the doesn't have the last word on things that in some ways he can he can be I think in some ways there's there's certain simplifications that he makes that are that are problematic and I just gave one set of him there with masculine feminine but it's also striking to me how much he gets simplistically misunderstood by both sides in the effort to impose a kind of stereotype on him which he I mean that famous was at a BBC or channel 4 interview with awful Chinaman channel 4 interview with with Kathy Newman was an example of that where it didn't seem like she was really hearing the complexity of what he was saying and already had a pigeonhole that she was trying to kind of hammer him into and he was reacting against I'm I deeply admire his capacity to engage the world with a kind of articulate force he he's about 12 years younger than I am and I think has just a little bit more extroverted predisposition predispositions in him than I do where I you know I prefer being a little less at the focus of even though some of my my work obviously pushes boundaries I'm not as eager as he seems to be or he certainly is capable of handling just a tremendous amount of like controvert controversy and the onslaught of aggressive questioning and so forth and he and he tends to do well under aggressive questioning which not not all of us do I think in general aggressive questioning can make it more difficult for the person who's being questioned and the questioner to to on dig deeper and unpack a more profound understanding that might reflect something that wouldn't have been included had that dialogue not taken place so but I have to say I am in real admiration of even though I don't agree with everything that Jordan Peterson says it's it's I really admire his spirit his capacity to think under pressure and speak to a number of audiences and his son and the fact that he is I see in this I think some of the force that's coming through him is collective its he is a he is a kind of channel for things that haven't been said for a while and that in some sense needed to be said it's a you know he said he's a kind of channel of the return of the repressed in that sense and he has the articulate potency of a person who was carrying more than just his personal thinking he's he's got a kind of collective psyche so archetypal drive that is informing what what and how he is saying what he is what do you think those things are those repressed archetypal things well well one is to certainly his his calling upon men to kind of basically find their strong center again and take responsibility for their lives and their actions and to become disciplined and what what DEP psychologists would say it would be to basically integrate the Cenex the the that the Saturn archetype the archetype that brings in a capacity for for for self discipline for a backbone for that's grounded in tradition and you you must also give him given your work be very pleased to see him kind of bringing young back into the mainstream or talking about young in such a high-profile way yes there there are I don't know how much that's coming in as a return of the repressed but it but you know it's it's interesting young himself over the last decades seems to be going through a quite a in elevation within the culture and when the New York Times gave that you know 17 pages in the New York Times Magazine to the publication of Young's red book about ten years ago that was pretty much the first positive thing that the New York Times had allowed itself to say about young since the very good obituary that it wrote for him in 1961 it got kind of overtaken by a by you know a kind of you know narrower Freudian in intellectual viewpoint and then an even anti Freud at a certain point anti depth psychology generally and I think the more we're moving into what I would think of as the deeper and more mature form of the postmodern and the more voices that are being allowed into the cultural conversation the more young I think is going to be recognized as not a flawless thinker but a but a necessary and deep one necessary for us to to assimilate he he was carrying deep deep truths that came from a very deep dive that he took a kind of almost shamanic descent that spontaneously happened to him in the nineteen thirteen to nineteen twenty p ria dand he came out of that with with real treasures like basically the end that he gave to the culture the idea that we don't understand human psychology unless we understand that psyche is soul and that there is a spiritual dimension to human existence and to human fulfillment that if we do not take account of it we are mutilating ourselves and we'll never really be psychologically healthy or his his recognition that were all embedded in a larger collective psyche that is evolving and that is is going through its own spiritual transformations and that we're in a kind of adventure of of consciousness individually as well as collectively I think Jung's recce Nishan of in the end of it on the individual level of how important the second half of life is and the turn towards away from external public achievement and more recognising that the inner world and finding meaning and finding a spiritual fulfillment that is not dependent on youth and a kind of robust quality of being in the world but has is connecting with some deeper sources of archetypal meaning and purpose that give us a sense of life's value all these are crucial gifts that Jung gave us and and I think more and more people are assimilating and you mentioned SLN before and at that time the we're talking about kind of intellectual dark web now a constellation of thinkers there was quite a mighty constellation of thinkers around Esalen I mean you can probably tell me more of the names but I think Joseph Campbell was there Stan Grof was there Abraham Maslow was there yeah yeah it was I mean it's an amazing place first of all one of the most beautiful places in the world but because of its kind of mission founded in 1962 and Abraham Maslow and his sense of it's interesting NASA was walking was driving through Big Sur which can sometimes be quite foggy and it's a narrow highway on going along a cliff and he got lost and he saw this sign wrestlin Institute right right after he'd been started and he came down the hill to sort of find out where he was and he came into the lodge and there he saw people reading his book towards it you know news it's like a psychology of being and he and and so Maslow was an that whole idea of self-realization it was very important so many of course there are a lot of psychotherapists like Fritz Perls and RD Laing and also people who were working within the body area like IDA Ralph and Rolfing Feldenkrais but you also had people who were like Fritjof Capra Joseph Campbell Gregory Bateson gene Houston Stan Grof was there as the scholar and residents for for 17 years and he he brought in people like the Rupert Sheldrake and David Bohm and people who were kind of opening up the Terrance came as well we had excellent conference all the early psychedelic pioneers were there Albert Hoffman came from who and synthesized and discovered LSD he came and of course stan grof and and terrance represented like the the next generation of and there's another example of someone sort of hyper articulate and and and definitely had a kind of charismatic quality that seems to have been infused by his psychedelic explorations so anyway yes it was a countercultural Malstrom and hotbed of of new and ancient thinking practices ideas that rippled out into the world all well it's it's still in existence and is a great place to visit but I think in many ways it was during the 60s and 70s that it really brought its gift into the world and disseminated it out so that many many others have been carrying it out in other parts of the world since then you
