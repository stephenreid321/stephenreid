soon after the election there was this very very strange incident at the annual meeting of the National Policy Institute the NPI and that's a very innocuous name for an organization that many people believe is sort of you know if not if not you know white you know National is very very you know far-right and at its head at the time was Richard Spencer he's also the fellow who founded the alternative right and was a trump supporter at the time at all and so on and so on now what was strange about this meeting was that at the beginning of it Spencer was very excited about Trump's victory so to start the meeting by addressing the crowd and said hail Trump now hail are a hero you know hail our victory we made this happen we dream Trump into the White House or something along these lines now that the video from that meeting that turned up on all you know all the regular press around the world and all that but there's a fella named Harvey Bishop who is a New Thought blogger now New Thought is named for a generic kind of philosophy called mental science positive thinking a simple way to think of it is that you know thoughts are causative as I said earlier somehow what's inside our head unlike Vegas what's in the mind does doesn't always stay there what happens in the mind doesn't always stay there so New Thought philosophy is that you can create we create a reality thoughts that causative we project out into the world the kind of reality that that we want was just kind of magic yep Matt's absolutely is magic and we do this unconsciously it's magic when you you know you're doing it and you can you can kind of do it at will I guess and so this ship who's you know writes about new thought all the stuff about we've made this happen we dream this into reality that sounded a lot like the kind of things that people practice mental science and you thought do Trump himself is a devotee of New Thought you know he's a follower of norman vincent peale author of the power of positive thinking he went to his sermons when he was a boy he went there Trump well I say what I say whether he's using magic but he certainly is a devotee of positive thinking positive thinking has its roots and you thought new thought has its roots in 19th century occultism and that's one side of it the other side is the Chaos magic side which I say in the book that he probably has never heard of it but he seems to do it naturally he seems to have a natural sort of talent for the ways in which Kaos magicians are said to operate you know the Soviet glamour creating chaos moving in and out of realities adopting truth and falsehood as just beliefs that you have temporarily and you dismiss them and you don't longer do but just the what the one thing that really sort of sold me on there being kind of a similar morphology let's say between New Thought which generally seems kind of innocuous I mean Norman Vincent Peale you know he's very sober you know conservative Reverend and the Chaos magic tends to be a bit more wild in punky and and and and dangerous but they're both results-driven they're both very specific about it's not about you know a mystical experience it's not about you know finding your higher-self it's about having some effect in the real world and and they're very specific about it and and again it's not just it's not like expect a miracle it's like you have to focus on something that's doable and just needs a little a little bit more of a nudge and you're saying no Trump's victory was just the teetered here and there so if I'm saying if if you allow for the possibility of in some way the mind group mind in some way being to affect things that well just in chaos theory you know sensitivity to initial conditions in a little butterfly flapping over here make something over there so who knows if nudge of some way and this is a word that they used in Paris magic you can even nudge it in a certain way give it a spin and then it comes to the the result that you thought you want but in the long run the idea was that somehow the people on the alt-right we had used the Internet as a way to propagate what-what means you know Richard Dawkins term for this kind of cultural Jeane kind of thing so we that happens anyway without magic but they were using one meme in particular which was of this cartoon character known known as Pepe the Frog who was a very harmless amphibian he got drawn into this as I cut what they called the sigil and the sigil is a kind of symbol or image that contains you know magical powers magical energies the magician's intention of his will and his imagination and traditionally you make you know you draw one you make one you know that kind of thing but what's called meme magic is an offshoot of something called chaos magic and you can understand chaos magic by thinking of it as something like found art you know there's traditional art where the painter paints something and works on it and the idea that this becomes a focus for intention yes exactly I so the Internet becomes this kind of the realm in which the magic takes place and long story short what what people start how this became something that people were aware of was that people were posting all this stuff and they started to see these strange coincidences between what they were posting and stuff happening in the real world and this got coined syncro mysticism which is a kind of techno update to Jung's a notion of synchronicity which is when there's something something taking place in the inner world and something in the outer world and they're absolutely connected in some indubitable meaningful way but there's no causal connection you know there's no there's no way that one or the other is linked in the usual ways and that's why we people isn't meaningful coincidence so this mean magic rather than have our traditional imagination inside our heads even have the internet out there so the Internet is a kind of externalized imagination and and makes sense because more and more regular world is in this kind of strange interface between its representation electronically and the real world and we want more and more electronic representation of the world to be more lifelike so everything's HD everything's blue-ray whatever it is more and more stuff like that so again as I said earlier there's this kind of interchange going on between reality and its representation so it makes sense in some way that stuff happening on the internet would find it echo out in the world so that's kind of the theory behind it and when people notice that this was happening they said okay what can we make it happen on purpose I mean you're not saying that one group of people got together and did it but it was almost like self generated yeah I mean there was some I'm assuming that some people started it but then when he launched these things they get picked up out there and you know there was a basically I'm not saying every person who did it was consciously saying you know okay we're gonna do this but some people were some people were posting things say hey look one of the things that happened they would post things on these sites and the you're anonymous when you post them but you get a number there's an 8 8 digit number is assigned to your post and people kept seeing when they posted stuff about pepie post itself about Trump there would be you know duplicates or triplicates or four of the same number so it seems some kind of approval it's somehow you know do more of that you know and they were betting which were they going to get a double they're going to get a trip you know all this kind of thing so there seems to be some kind of response you know from from the medium media that they were using there was a kind of chaos magic going on there's a couple of interesting things a one that the narrowness of Trump's victory the the condition it was a it was an incredibly narrow victory it was almost like if you could see it as a kind of reverse miracle if you didn't if you didn't want him to be elected you could see it was a reverse miracle there was some kind of inevitability to it that despite the fact he got three million less votes he was elected but also I don't know if you've seen Jordan Peterson talking about the frog symbolism and how and how you have I haven't so he he says this was the most intense synchronicities he ever he ever saw as he started becoming aware of what the frog represented so the Frog the Frog is between categories so symbolically it's between categories and also symbolically the frog was the the deity of Keck well that's the other thing all these strange weird coincidence is the ancient Egyptian god of heck is a frog and what's kept the god of chaos and what's the one word that you would characterize Trump's you know mo chaos so hey it all seems to make sense because certainly within the circle surrounding Trump like Steve Bannon for example talks about Judea Savola and yes so there's certainly an awareness and affinity for the occult within the we didn't know well that was the other thing that sent me thinking like yes it's for the people watching who's Judas of all in in February 2017 Steve ban and who was still on Trump's bench then he gave a speech to what's known as the human dignity Institute and this is Khmer DUP of a very conservative churchmen in the Vatican Bannen was in LA talked in via Skype but what the New York Times hit on in this speech which is peddled the usual global teapot global tea party a sort of thing in it was that as you say Bannon named Chuck Julius Evelyn now if you know who Jesus Evelyn is you know that he was the 20th century esoteric thinker who had very far-right political views he's brilliant very controversial he was called the dangerous author by the German novel is Herman HESA and ever tried to ingratiate himself first this Mussolini and then with National Socialists he had he had a bit of influence on was Mussolini but in the end he gave up on the Italians and he gave up on Mussolini because they weren't fascist enough for him he had this vision of a kind of absolute fascism it's kind of theocratic kind of state and then he tried to get his ideas across to you know people close to Hitler but in the long run they they didn't adopt him and then after the war he was this kind of fat shadowy figure in the background the the the kind of the intellectual provided material about magic and oh yeah and he talks precisely about the kind of using the mind to create reality but I would say and so he died again like gap so he died there really so the idea I mean what was saying is the idea of that this was consciously created by a certain number of people is not is not observed even knowing what we know I mean it's not absurd it's not inconceivable I just say that I'm just sort of saying I'm not saying they did this I'm saying it looks like all this is possible and everything is kind of lined up and well in the long run yes I do say it's not inconceivable because I personally accept the reality of synchronicities I've had too many of them to dismiss them and a few other sorts of things and okay if and I would say my definition of magic is induced synchronicity they happen can you make them happen and I could say that's what the new thought that's what Chaos magic choice to do so that to me is the is the crux not that they happen they do happen can you make them happen but nobody ever loved as I said in up until his death in the 70s after World War two he was this kind of intellectual figure you know doing the philosophy for a variety of different far-right groups that were rising up out of the rubble but in the 20s he contributed a series of articles to esoteric journal and they're all about being able to focus the mind intently on your goal and and he talks about the absolute individual and again it's this idea that some fundamental level of our being you know before you are you your personality and you know you do what you do you live where you live in some very very basic bedrock level of being you know it's the general mystical idea that was somehow we are the ultimate reality already you know we don't know what we've forgotten it but if you can get down to that level then you can narrow and focus your intent enough to be able to affect reality at the time in the 20s whenever lo was doing this and he was doing rituals and and different practices what he wanted to do the reality he wanted to affect was Mussolini's fascist he wanted to so to imbue them with the ancient Roman virtues and I don't know how successful he was but this is what he was trying to do so even then you have EV Allah who it was informing Steve Manon he's also a big name for all the old right people he's one of the top kind of intellectual figures that they name check to show that they're more sophisticated than the earlier kind of skinheads and Evelyn is also top of the reading list for this fellow named Alexander Dugan who in different ways he has yeah well he's again depending who you're talking to oh no don't know Putin never heard of me oh yes I saw him the other day you know you know at different times Dugan himself as has said contrary things about because how much influence our contact he's had but again if you know what Dugan is interested in and he's interested in some very odd things and if you follow Putin speeches and actually what he's done in the world you can see where if not everything certainly some areas where Duggan's ideas have which again go back to people like Evelyn and chaos magic and a variety of different fascist totalitarian kind of ideas he does this kind of Lego game with ideologies where he takes he takes the good bits that say from national socialism or fascism stallin ISM and and puts them together and there's something equals the fourth political theory which he's working on creating it hasn't arrived yet but it's something that's a work in progress but it's something to replace the global you know liberal liberalism that's come upon us and Francis Fukuyama pointed to his showing the end of history back in the early nineties I mean that that that vision nauseates do again and you know it doesn't go down that well with Putin either because he's talking about kind of return to blood and soil for that my guess is it I'm sorry it's more of a return to like blood and soil yes yeah well I mean yeah yeah well it's the whole I guess it's a whole idea it's it's nationalistic but it's the whole well the idea that the end of history arrived when you know free market values and liberal democracy have spread around the whole I mean for some people yes clap hands other people like Dugan and others say so this is no they so this is the world being just turned into a market place you know for them you know the globalization for them is basically meaning that you know wherever the US or the Western the Western powers go and liberate people it's basically to open up a new market and you know we have to say you know there's a lot to be said for that at that point of view but his alternative to that is this kind of theocratic he talks about having seeing a fascist state from Vladivostok to Dublin and he talks about somebody called Eurasia and Eurasia is the idea that Russia is not a backward cousin of Europe who's never quite catching up to European Western ways it's a completely new civilization of its own as different routes different influences different aims different values and he talks about rather than this linear idea of history of being you know there's a beginning and you know it's just cumulative it's more like there's individual cultures it goes back to a German historian and oswald spengler they wrote a book called the decline of the West incidentally but he talked about rather than civilizations or history being this linear thing with one civilization growing on top of the other were they're all self-enclosed and they have their own value so that there's not one mathematics there's you know Persian mathematics and there's the it talks about these doofus Faustian culture any case that's the idea and again that's very much along the lines not only in the right not only sort of thing do again century but also in the left the whole idea that you know oh there isn't one oppressive truth you know there's lots of different truths anything goes you know and it's all socially constructed well that's just trickled down Spengler miss pang was saying no there isn't one civilizations are like flowers they're in the same garden but they're not the same flower and they're not all working to get to one big flower at the end each one grows matures blooms and dies what impact did it have on you or how exciting was it to to discover that this this stuff that you've been interested in for so long was suddenly showing up in all of these crazy ways facilitated by the Internet as this kind of you know I've thought for a while the Internet is kind of a it's it's by democratizing information it's kind of a allowing all of this stuff to bubble up from the from the cracks in our culture and in a way that would make perfect sense why magic the occult positive thinking is now coming up and is is changing politics and changing culture at the surface of the highest levels well I it's it's excited I woke up when I woke up when I saw that the New York Times had had name-check Julia Zavala I thought well you know things have changed now in the New York Times first place to mention Julie said oh there was something but then for them to mention it in the context of at the time someone who was a close advisor to Trump giving a talk to people who Vatican and then even within that the context where he refers to ever law is in reference to Putin and in reference to this fellow Dugan who's around Putin noticed oh wow you know all the stuff that's on the fringe and on the margins as to the center and that again confirmed for me the idea that reality had changed something had changed again it's not we still have three dimensions you know the still the past present future but how do we understand these things how we understand what it means to be human I wouldn't stand freedom all these you know they're very important things how we even communicate it's very difficult to talk about things I mean I'm one of the things in this article I wrote about Peterson was that and I say it in the book is that you had this strange thing happening where you know liberal left students were shouting down professors or people giving a talk or lecture and they were saying things you know they didn't like okay you can disagree that's fine but what is the difference between you shouting professors down now and Nazi youth shouting down Jewish professors and you know in the 30s because you know yes by all means students in protests but all student protests aren't about sweetness and light you know and and you know God you know if you go back even earlier you know the university students in Germany in the 19th century were incredibly nationalists and so their protests were all about nationalism they were burning foreign books and things like that so it struck me as I said we're just it's exciting but then the same time I don't know if people are prepared to actually understand what it means I mean I I worked really hard at trying to communicate these esoteric hermetic ideas in a language in the context that you don't have to agree with them but at least they make sense and I can show that they're not that far away from any concerns of the mainstream edition is it exciting or terrifying well it's it's the thing that's both you know it's a you're sort of on the edge and there's no guarantee where it's going to go and that's what all these people say it's up to you it's not an automatic process it isn't the class war you know like oh the the march of history we'll just if you just let history do itself it'll take it'll take the line of least resistance so if you don't like what's happening will you have to use magic yourself to kind of try and change it I think at all times it's very good to be aware of what's going on inside your head I think that's that's the key and if you don't have things going on there then other things will be will be in there okay so I said what happens in the mind doesn't know necessarily always stay there but it might what happens in somebody else's mind what might wind up inside yours too so the whole idea of wakefulness attention all these things which have a kind of cliche but an all character to them that but they're actually you know they're real and again it doesn't mean you know shouting down Trump or doing anti-trump stuff or something it just means being very very aware in a way because I think in these times when it's very it's it is sensitivity to initial conditions a little thing can and can make something happen so are we back in the time of Magic III I don't think we ever left it I think it's more out in the open now and as I say we're not really prepared to how as you say we can dismiss it we can say oh those guys that you know doing these whatever it is and be critical about it but we're not really prepared how to deal with it positively and I don't mean in the sense of everybody going out and you know sorry casting spells or reading tarot cards in the sense of accepting but what does it mean if it's not if it isn't just all this superstition everyone's told us I mean one of the things I I like to think of it as there was the time we couldn't talk about sex without it you just couldn't talk about it or you couldn't talk it without it being much notes wink wink you know slightly titillating you know kind of thing but now we can talk about if you talk about God and all different kinds of ways very clinically very frank and straightforward and it makes it absolutely uninteresting in many ways but we still can't talk about the occult or magic in that way you still get the x-files you know soundtrack comes on in the background and the blue feeling comes up and don't want to lose that entirely just like you don't want to lose you know the allure of sex but you also want to be able to talk about the open to open it up you know to make it to make as low so yeah otherwise you're a victim and people who are are the people going to do it you know if if you're not if reality's up for grabs then get your skates on because if you're not gonna do it then other people going to and you'll be stuck with the reality that's there and again I don't mean sitting at home and you know visualizing reality just just being aware that these things work consciousness is something that's it doesn't just it's not just there it's not like ring-fenced and protect it it's it's part of a continuum of other things and things can get in without you even consciously knowing it I mean they this is one of the things gaps were felt when in Germany in the 20s because he was around some of the early Nazi rallies and he said and this is why he talks about that those group rallies precisely as the expression of the magical structure of consciousness and one of the one of the characteristics of that is this kind of continuum a visceral continuum it's not rational it operates below below the rational line and he talks about how when he went to these rallies even though he resisted it he could feel you could feel the kind of energy whatever you want to call it coming into him and not only ocultist but people in you know science people like Rupert Sheldrake and people like that they talk about something let's along those lines so I think these things are true I think we just need to be we need to stay awake basically
