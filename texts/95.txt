more than ever there's this revolution in non-ordinary states of consciousness and that people are using them to mend trauma they are using them to access information and inspiration and they're using them to connect and collaborate in ways that haven't necessarily been possible at this scale before that's all good news and that's creating a ton of positive things both in personal growth and development adjuncts to different psycho therapies and medical interventions increases in solving hard problems that we face as entrepreneurs or as a society so we're talking about like micro dosing we're talking about all sorts of different experiment you could really I mean and certainly the premise that Stephen Connor and I wrote about in stealing fire is that it's the neuro chemistry we have access to you know that's our toolkit and you can get to it through a bunch of different means you can use smart tech you can use meditation you can use breathing techniques and use sexuality you can use pharmacology you can use dance and movement and music really that to me is the interest the most interesting thing of all it's not what's the flavor of the week and what does a new study tell us it's that we understand the neurophysiology of human optimization and transcendence now now the interesting thing is no sooner do you have that experience of being able to prompt ecstatic or moments where we step beyond ourselves and you could call flow States there's a there's a lot of different Peake states that would fall under that big tent and you end up with you know people bonding very closely with the folks they share those experiences with what Victor Turner the anthropologist would recall communitas so the moment you have ecstatically inspired community then you have to kind of just tackle head-on the question and the liability of the cult because a cult and you know most of us when we think of that we think of it in the sort of scandalous terms we think of it in the helter skelter Manson family or the Jim Jones drink the kool-aid side but from you know religious studies or anthropology a cult is literally just a community of practice bonded together around some Eppie fanuc you know or revelatory experience basically it's any religious group that doesn't yet that is not yet state sanctioned is a cult so the question is is we know there are dysfunctional ones we know there are lots and lots of unethical cults particularly where leaders hijack money power sexuality and control and even pick pick any two and you're done you know so the question is is rather than steering away from that and as and saying that won't happen or it shouldn't happen or that's not what we're doing steer into it and say okay if we're gonna build vibrant communities of practice how do we build ethical cults and and what I would imagine and that's clearly a conversation for us all to figure out but what I would imagine is that you know we've seen this movie before we know how this goes badly wrong and we've had about a half century of you know Eastern hierarchical lineage traditions getting buggered up and bastardized and imported into the West and varying kind of gurus with feet of clay stepping up to lead Children's Crusade you know that all just go off the cliff and so the question would be if we're trying to build ethical cults VA you know are they experimental and experiential so that there is no Dogma or doctrine to buy into they decentralized so that people maintain their own common sense their own judgment and their own agency and and are they pointed towards I would hope some sort of social good or action and and can you and and all of the the known issues of dysfunctional cult can we just say hey let's just forever be vigilant about shared in groups about specific vernacular about an inside-outside group mentality about mediated access to ecstasy right and that's another kicker cuz they're almost in every single one of those situations where it does go wrong that group does something together that creates a state experience that they come to believe is exceptional special and quite often is doled out or tightly controlled by the person in charge and so if we create distributed access to techniques of ecstasy so everybody is on their own recognizance you know and responsible for having access to these things integrating them and growing them there are no fish stories to swallow so it's it's open source meaning making and there's no sage on the stage there's nobody up front there has lopsided truth or authority claims that maybe we have the chance and then also you know a great one from a lot of religious traditions that seems to get skipped these days is an ethic of service are we doing something with this or are we just gonna crawling up our arses and engaging in endless self-development so that would be my hope is that is that ethical code building is the game of how do we create lots of nodes all of which are unique and different from each other they all form with their own kind of local DNA and particular missions and purposes they may even have their own belief systems but we can say X tosses the peak experience catharsis the healing and communitas become the kind of three-legged stool that you can basically build tightly net highly collaborative functional and effective small communities around what's the benefit of creating these kind of flow States in the first place well I think I mean the benefits of many and much of the research you know starting in University of Chicago going through lots of other organizations and universities has just been that flow states tend to create a lot of positive benefits including heightened and more precise decision-making a lot of sort of rather than meditation and stillness it's sort of meditation in action so you have real-time decision-making you have increased problem-solving increased innovation increased connectivity in group flow situations or like heightened team situations and then you also tend to have a high self-reported spike in overall life satisfaction so on a simplest sense I guess I kind of think about those peak States almost like when your laptop has been left open too long and you've got too many browser windows open it starts bogging down and getting glitchy and that's kind of how we are these days so that continuous partial attention there's never a time where we truly decompress even on planes now how do those Wi-Fi follows us everywhere our smartphones follow us everywhere the natural rhythms of life have all just been ironed out even in you know urinals and gas stations we're getting bombed by laughs there's just no down time so most of us are suffering from some version of sort of almost micro PTSD constantly our nervous systems are just fibrillating and so cultivating these peak states is like just doing a cold reset on your laptop it just lets our nervous systems power down and then when we come back online we come back to a neutral balance spot and from there we have choice and it may not last for a long time we may get overwhelmed with the wind with the barrage again but at least we have that bit of space to return to Center and start living from there again and the more regularly we can do that then that becomes that becomes a known location and we can kind of use it to find ourselves again and with the onslaught of you know all the information these none ordinary states are these what's tangrowth for example was talking about yeah absolutely and and non-ordinary states literally can mean anything other than waking state consciousness in stealing fire and in general in the kind of optimal psychology space we tend to skew to the ones I mean schizophrenia would be a non-ordinary states will be a non-ordinary state manias would be non-ordinary states as well but i think stan grof and and that the rest of that sort of broad discipline would generally described them as optimal and helpful states that don't correlate with normal waking consciousness which is typically first beta wave your electric activity prefrontal cortical executive functional activity and often as we said some form of a mild vigilance or arousal stress response
