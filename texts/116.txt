I guess with me too and all this focus on men's behavior what's strange is how similar it feels to the 1970s where what forty years on the original men's movement that the way that the women's movement and feminism has kind of given women consciousness and men need to step up and respond to it feels very very contemporary feels like it could have been written yesterday yeah so it feels like we're in the same yes thing and it's kind of led by women coming out and finding their voice in addressing and challenging the masculine and what's sometimes called the patriarchy or patriarchal behavior or unconscious things in the mail maybe even set or kind of kick-started a little bit by at the political situation by somebody like Trump being elected I don't know what all the factors that bring it up right now but it's I'm happy that it comes up you know it's great for women to really speak up and to tell the truth and with the meet you thing and you know to not swallow it and the level of denial that's been there for so long it's really exposed right now what you know so many men have presumed is okay it's just not okay and so there's a real like whoa gotta check myself out that's really great and then that brings a response from the men but if we come back with like oh my god it's terrible person and I'm a male and then you know nothing can happen nothing good from that space yeah I am let me face those places inside of myself where I have those distortions where I might be misogynist misogynistic where I might have unconscious you know sexual projections onto women and look at that and I feel like that's what we were doing back in the 70s also you know that whole concept of objectifying women was completely unknown at that point our thought about you really what oh yeah god I do that I do that all the time you know what happens if I go into that and look at how I do that does that change how I see women and how I relate to women yes it does you know but it's got to be owned you know so right now we're being called on to look again you know and it's not to please the women though we have to do it for ourselves because there's something comes up and if there's a reaction there inside to it it's telling us something about ourselves and to do it for ourselves and how would you summarize the work that men need to do in the simplest possible way is it to really look at themselves look at the distortions look at the look at the ways that because what because I say there's a kind of integration that a lot of these negative behaviors of men are are disintegrated parts of the male psyche that on their own are very can be very dangerous like the aggression left to itself or rage or any of these like there are tools and they're part of what makes like they're part of the male psyche but they have to be integrated healthily within within the personality that's how I how I see it yeah well it is my observation that most of the work that men have to do on themselves has to do with getting grounded in their masculinity and most of the work that women have to do on themselves it kind of relaxed confident grounded in their femininity and then of course we have this inner polarity I have a feminine side a woman as a masculine side but those sides rather than be problematic which they are and you're not relaxed and confident in your biological sex become very easy to integrate as well as the external relationships with opposite sex so it seems to me that it is my experience that the work that people need to doing themselves is to really look at why do I not feel relaxed and confident grounded in the mask and in another word for that on the male side was castrated so this there's a castration wound usually that keeps man from feeling that he's really got what it takes you know to do the job and so instead of being relaxed and confident he's trying to compensate for the feeling of deficiency in these efforting and it brings him up and in this head and you know turns him into a dickhead and there's a lot of talk at the moment about wanting men to be more vulnerable like there's something definitely in the in the culture now about men being asked out from their open up to be more revealing about their feelings but it seems to me there's a kind of danger if that's not balanced by some kind of respect for the healthy masculine which is which is more than just vulnerability because that whole narrative sort of feeds into an idea that men are faulty masculinity is faulty there's something wrong with with the masculine it's not helpful for a man to go to vulnerability if there's not a respect for the mascot and to go to a kind of feminized personality type out of a feeling of guilt and shame for the mask on what the masculine is done and what it's capable of and all of that there is a lot of horror shows that have happened from the mess Khun Danai ibly but the healing of that is not for the men to become feminine it's for the men to grow up embrace their masculinity face the distortions that have been given to them by the culture and by their families face the castration this happened that's taking away their confidence in their power the personal wounding that's happened and show up in presence and then once in presence boner ability isn't is wonderful and it's man being in presence what does that look like and what is the work that gets us there as a man as men the work is before I think going through one thing is that collective place that's held in the masculine where it is really distorted and owning them and that means facing your own personal shadow and the collective masculine shadow and the impulses towards dominance and violence and anger and and all of the horror stuff that's happening in the world that comes from men is also inside of me it's also inside of you we all carry it we've all been imprinted with it but once we face that and once we we feel how it manifests in us and we allow herself to be courageous enough to say yeah I'm carrying that and I go in there and I feel it then I'm no longer a slave to it I'm a slave to it when it's operating from my unconscious when it's operating out of my shadow so it's it's the embracing of the distortion it's the allowance of the strong masculine energy to come through and and the irony of it is that so many men have come to work on themselves made a decision at some point that they want to be anything but like those guys you know pointing to the family pointing to the distorted men in our culture and stuff and so they reject the mask and it's a kind of self castration you know they want to be anything but like that and they can feel in sense that they have that inside of them they have the violence they have the distortion we have the aggression and yet my experience is is that it's not that big it's like it's a barrier you have to go through and so I often take men right into that in a really strong way and encourage them to really feel and and share and experience all the aggression inside all the distortion to own and to feel it to feel even the tendency towards violence the frustration that's there inside and when they do that they come in to they they go through you go through it and you come into a relaxed place underneath it which is really like the roots of the mask um you know and that's what holds the body afterwards but you can't get there if you don't pass through the distortion if you don't look at your shadow if you don't own that stuff and how it plays out in me and I find men are very very kind with each other when we share our shadow and we share our distortion doesn't go to judgment it's like it's relieving it's a cough yeah somebody's talking about it thank God what are the qualities of the healthy masculine well a healthy mass come from one has is grounded so this is present about a man when he's in landed in his mascot where he's it's it's relaxing to be around him in a way because he's grounded he's not efforting he's not trying to be somebody he's not coming from a place of deficiency so there's this grounded presence that is as a strong sense of discriminating intelligence can see what's needed in a particular situation and take action an appropriate action without going over his own boundaries and without transgressing other people's boundaries and we talk about the essence of masculine the essence of feminine sometimes it's very easy to say oh well think of a quality like receptivity well men should be receptive as well or women can be strong so when you talk about people sometimes get a bit touchy about using the word masculine and feminine to mean certain qualities what do you see is the essence of the masculine for example well I people do get really touchy about that and and sometimes I think that's really a pity because there there there's an implicit judgement in there and I'd offensiveness and that whole thing you know it's like yes I can be really receptive and soft and what are typically called feminine qualities but I think in that the essence and real embodiment of the mascot it's different it's just to say it's different than the feminine is absolutely equal absolutely equal in levels of power absolutely equal and levels of intelligence telchines absolutely equal down through the whole list but completely different you know and my embodiment in my and my expression of myself as a man is different than a woman in the feminine and her expression through the feminine and as the feminine but does she have masculine qualities of course she does and she can be as assertive strong and you know directional as I am in when she employs her masculine side when she gets into trouble is when her masculine side is dominating them unconscious consciousness in running the show same for me you know I can be you know as integrated in some masks on I can very easily go into my feminine contact and and touch and love and [Music] nonlinear thinking kind of poetic artistic side all that can happen but if I'm not grounded in my Maskin and I'm overwhelmed by my feminine then I come out with a kind of distorted feminine I become kind of bitchy and Moody and withdrawn and hostile and edgy and critical I mean it's like it's a swampy moody or a shelf for a man to be unconsciously possessed by a feminine hmm that's what young called animal possession exactly exactly and on the other side there's an animus possession when a woman is unconsciously possessed by her mask on side it's it's difficult you know she'll be very judgmental opinionated she'll always know how things should be and have no problem telling anybody and everybody about it and the problem though with animals and it's judgmental-ness is that it's not only directed outward to the outer world it's also directed inward towards the woman's own femininity and masculine them can hold the feminine in a kind of captivity inside and keeps it down which is you know kind of ironically the whole it's the internalization of the exterior world situation and we're doing a workshop in February to give people a or to give men a more direct sense of some of these qualities that we're talking about what do you hope people will get from that workshop a weekend intensive process that they come away feeling in love with being a man that they're just vibrating in it they can feel it in their bones they can feel through the whole body and their their unapologetic and unashamed and they're connected with authentic vein of male energy and they they don't feel afraid of other men they feel trust in other men they feel close with other men they feel empowered they feel a sense of self-esteem and I would hope that they come out with a hint of some kind of direction and purpose because I think that's very important for for men just to feel a sense of what do you really want you know and so in a way you could we could say this would be kind of like going to the roots of the mass gun I want them to have an embodied experience because when it's really embodied and you feel it there's just no denying it you know and it's
