[Music] Ronen you just put out a film about Jordan Peterson contrasting him with Russell Brand and seeing what the left can learn from Jordan Peterson it's become more important to display loyalty to our political tribe than it is to understand a person or an issue in all of its complexity I'm Lauren hayatun and I'm exploring the new politics this on the other side of this culture and I see Jordan Peterson as a test case for getting there it's one of a few things I've seen from people on the Left who seem to be kind of asking that question but also I think there's a sense with some people on the left that they still don't want to have that conversation did you feel nervous about doing it and what were your conclusions from doing the project yeah I mean I was pretty sick with anxiety in like the weeks leading up to it because I am from probably like a traditional left activist circle where there's a real allergy to Peterson if you want to just put it softly and what we wanted to do was maybe ask for as a yes and to Peterson like what as an approach that honors his strengths and really kind of recognizes the contribution that he's made but also from our perspective point to the gaps in his thinking but even a tacit acknowledgement of those strengths there was the fear that that would be seen as on some level a betrayal and that did play out in some of the comments to the video we had a broadly positive response we had people say like thank God a refreshing critique from a left perspective that isn't just dismissing outright that there was some attempt to engage but it was really nice the way you framed it like we're we're ten especially in social media we're tempted to say to make an either/or judgement all the time yeah well this is a in a way the video was about Jordan Peterson's thinking but on a more meta level it was a commentary on a political culture so we face this enormous pressure to either love or hate either public figures or issues or to endorse them and to reject him and be very public in that but people and issues are really complex and with someone like Jordan Peterson I can see lots of as I said in the video profound contributions and strengths and also areas for I feel like as thinking is really off and how can you hold that complexity in a tribal polarized culture where you're kind of shut down for holding it and I think that that maybe is the new political space that's opening up there's more and more people willing to go like no I'm not going to just fall into a binary I'm gonna try and stay open and hold the complexity mmm yeah it's something that we've talked about before on our podcast is that hold that the kind of the test of sort of maturity in a way is holding many truths at the same time and not necessarily sort of saying this is true but this is also true and it seems that we're at a place this is also sort of the intellectual dark web for me as kind of like is it possible to think in public and thinking in public is very different from kind of reacting to things and I hope I think I think you're probably right that now a space is starting to open up for that kind of dialogue whereas maybe it wasn't or hasn't been because also the sense that the mainstream media doesn't necessarily allow that to happen if everything has to be fitted into a five-minute soundbite or whatever there's not really a lot of time to unpack ideas and develop conversations and it feels that there is a space opening up for the possibility of genuine thinking in public which I guess is really an interesting place to be yeah and if you can try and create a space that isn't from the get-go pushing people's buttons and triggers that puts them into this defensive mode if you really try and honor and and and and it's it's the basis of a procedure of inquiry it's the basis of therapy it's that you don't start with attacking someone you start with really honoring them and giving them a space to be seen and then from that place it's like okay I'm I'm more open and that's what we found in the comments is that with that acknowledgement of Peterson which is I think what Peterson fans are looking for it I don't think that they mind critiques per se it's more there's also an acknowledgement of him and not just an outright rejection yeah and so that was I think what's often interesting is it obviously is in this space it's not just the video the video is the stimulus and actually what was interesting to notice was did the tone or the or the calm the conversation changed it become more generative and I think that that's probably where we should be trying to get to yeah that's a really interesting point as well about firstly about that we can only start to inquire from a place of safety which is absolutely true and actually if you like Peterson talks about this and even McGilchrist talks about this we have two systems we have one system and this is polyvagal theory if you wanna kind of look at that what's going on underneath we're either in a defensive mode and we're not able to grow or we're in an inquiring explorative mode and then we can grow and actually you're right political discussions have to respect that as well and I think you're also right when you say that what turns off Peter I'd count myself a peace and peace and admirer certainly admire of his work I don't like the word fan I think that's that's a really dangerous energy to bring to anything because I've also we've also put out some podcast sort of critiquing what we see as some of his blind spots but I think what turns me off and what turns off a lot of other people who admire his work is the energy that comes through in a lot of the criticisms like you read things from from reporters that just say charlatans fraud or and you read it and you just think okay there may be things that he's not he's not seeing or he's got blind spots as everyone does but the energy and much of the criticism is just so off that I think it really makes a lot of people who've become extremely for familiar this is the other thing people have become deeply familiar with his work over a long time usually at their own in their own time so when they see this coming out and the media they just think okay there's something off about about the way that he's being critiqued well what's interesting is that that also needs to be met with the same energy of that person being seen and understood that that product principle goes all the way down so in this case the people who respond and say he's a charlatan he's a misogynist he's a fascist it's like what's going on there like what aspect of of them feeling unsafe that would lead to a very reactive response instead of open curiosity and I think that behind that is a whole set of emotional needs and so I think that at a best it's pointing to a form of political engagement that basically doesn't immediately dismiss that actually inquires into what's the thing behind the thing yes people might not be open to that but I still think there's an opportunity to model that as a general principle even if someone is unwilling to engage with it because I think that if you take let's say writers and feminist circles they have red lines around if there is a feeling that there is sexism there is misogyny there's an undermining of let's say black rights movements and and and whether or not Peterson is transgressing them is another thing but that if there is the feeling of that clearly that activates our very strong no and I think that I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of you know the left's relationship with identity politics and there's a lot of talk about you know it needs to get its house in order it needs to reject it and and move into a space that more people can get on board with it but the question is is the politics that we need nowadays a kind of a reject or is it a can we try and integrate can we can include can we listen to the the the genuine feelings that are there that lead people to believe that the world can be primarily understood as an oppressive system where there is an oppressor class and there is an oppress and even if that analysis is wrong there are clearly personal experiences there are clearly emotions there that have to be dealt with because they don't go away it's like you you know it's you're just rejecting it back into the shadows in a way and I so I and maybe I'm curious like how do we do that how how do we bring what is a therapeutic approach to political conversation and and is it possible I don't know I don't know I mean it's interesting because one of our criticisms of or critiques of Jordan Peterson was that he is too reactive that he is subject to a lot of these kind of relentless attacks from the media but the he our point was if he starts getting into reactivity in response then a lot of people are not going to hear his mess they're just gonna see angry white man and when we put that critique out there were quite a few people commenting and saying you're just blaming the victim because he's just reacting he's being attacked relentlessly and you're saying and effectively we were saying we were asking for an almost superhuman level of transcendence from him and that almost nobody would have been able to maintain under the under the weight of so many of the mischaracterizations and stuff that we see from the media so it's like if we're asking for I I I think you're right like I bought this for a while that you we do need to introduce some form of political therapy into the discourse it's like okay so what's really going on what what are the the experiences little led you to because our political views are almost always a reflection of a deeper psychological reality and I think unless we make space for that psychological reality there's no hope of of any kind of generative dialogue or real meeting but we're asking an awful lot of people to be able to do that I think personally I think all all we can do is create a space where that create a space where that is the dominant frame that is then that it you create the space there's a dominant frame and then other people can come into it but understanding that not everyone will be able to do that and maybe that isn't a frame that is appropriate for everybody and at some point if people have like wounds that mean that they're really not able to engage in generative dialogue then accept the inclusivity I only go so far and this is a big problem on the left I think is wanting to have a space that's completely inclusive of absolutely everything but then if you're including people who are not able to respect the the ground rules of what an inclusive general generative dialogue means then I think that's where the left gets into trouble because it's not very good at policing boundaries around around the ground rules of its own generative dialogue and then it gets hijacked very very quickly like left spaces are notorious for being hijacked by people with the with the most kind of keenly felt agendas and they're often the most pathological agendas although what or they're the ones that come from the deepest honor sense of wounding it's like how do you make space for that allow it to be processed but if it can't be processed then maybe it's not appropriate for them to be in that space I don't know but I think that's part of the the narrative or the dynamic that comes in in a lot of these spaces because Peterson talks about this it's like the left doesn't like boundaries hates boundaries hates hierarchies hates boundaries but it's we need some boundaries to be able to have generative dialogues yeah I mean I agree and I think you've described broadly the parameters of what that looks like I just don't know how you can do that online on Facebook when the like button is determining most people's behavior I do think we should have expected of Jordan Peterson I think that if you rise to such a level of influence there is this transition that you make from becoming the kind of the backbench politician to the statesman and like statesmen power from Trump behave differently when they're on the world stage and you know I've the thing that maybe I've been more Sivaji to is just the degree to which there's such a rejection of young student activists who might be kind of in the throes of a particular ideology that they might be able to see but there are also young students and they do mean well and they do see a very up world and want to change it and rather than and particularly as a clinical psychologist rather than taking what I might assume the like I kind of a fatherly a grandfatherly approach of really like seeing them and honoring them and then from that place of openness bringing them to a greater place of individuation a better relationship with ideology it's just like you are the curse of the world and it's like well well like it god it's no wonder the left hands a difficulty going to board a Petersen there they're being shouted at and so it's interesting that you know the person that I see modeling this often the least is Peterson even though in other forums he I can see him very open to learning and in this dialogue but when it comes to the left just like oh I think I agree with you about all of those points I think there's the the issue for me is because he says this also it's like he says people don't have ideas ideas have people so if that's true then where is the compassion for people who are under the sway of a pernicious idea and I I think part of that is that his trajectory so far has been in combat with the left I mean this was his like his job was at risk and then he was also I think quite quickly because of the times we were in pulled into one side of the culture wall and that worked for him for quite a while and I agree I do think that especially now I kind of hoped that there could be some more openness to to dialogue with the left because I actually don't think he is he like he's characterized as being on the right I genuinely don't think he is I think he he is more of a centrist and I think is his natural sort of place of if he hadn't been sort of pushed so far by by a lot of the kind of the media interactions that he's had I think his natural place would have been midway between the two but I think the the optics and the way that he's sort of gotten success by pushing the kind of anti s JW student politics thing has probably locked him into a little bit of a reactivity towards it and maybe there's some kind of aftermath of the experience that he went in went through in Toronto as well that comes out in the way that because the way that he talks about the left is different from where he talks about the right yeah so I would say that there probably is some political PTSD going on with his experience in Toronto and I think that in a knee dynamic it's not just him being assailed and being reactive he's also co-creating that dynamic and I do think that he has ridden the wave of anti identity politics anti regressive left sentiment to get to this point and I think that what all of us are calling for is can there be a transcendence of that like in true developmental fashion can you know can Jordan Peterson reinvent and remake himself in order to unify more people and but but maybe the from what I see is that I don't see him being in a relationship to the left like the things that I would want to see from him is less skepticism about climate change more like explicit critique of Trump like that there are certain like you know I don't want to describe it as a a box-ticking exercise but there are things that we would need to here on the left in order to feel like our this person speaks for us and I know that yes my my my thing is I still don't think the left is at any point ready to meet him that's my my prop because I I even see like people so obviously we're deeply interested in sort of integral thinking this idea of yes and and I don't see even when I see kind of integral thinkers talking about being yes and with Peterson the energy of it for me is not yes and it's still rejecting or it's still saying no you're wrong about this I'm not sure the left is yeah I think it's starting to have that conversation that might be able to kind of integrate what he's saying but I don't see it happening yet and I don't I think there's still there's still work that needs to be done on both sides to be able to get there yes definitely I but I may be and this is an idea that came from Jonathan Ryan's essay critique is that it is a yes and or it is of both end and it's an either/or you can have a fully rounded position on Peterson's virtues as weaknesses and then come down on the side of ultimately I don't think you're a positive force in the world ultimately I'm critical that you don't talk enough about structural problems and systemic issues this is the theme of the video that released was like I would love to see Peterson talk about systems change what needs to change in a structural level I think in the interview that you've done with him you've talked about the structural conditions for psychological growth like that's the territory I would love to see him move into and also in terms of his like he's very male centric and I think that it's it's great that there was a public figure that is standing up for men but it also ideally it would take a progression towards being integrative and that women would also feel like he speaks for them because currently it's very easy just to see that he doesn't we connected over a project called alter ego which is which is now your media channel and a couple of gatherings over the last couple of years you want to sort of describe what the I what the framing of alter ego is what what's what's the aim with alter ego I think there framing of it now I began as this idea of the progressive politics is in crisis it is a crisis of ideas and that's controversial yeah and that spirituality is the place to look for answers that we're missing that there's just a kind of a limit to what we can do materialism and that there is a kind of a transcendent possibility with spirituality that can renew progressive politics and like seeing movements on the right who are well equipped with mystical language and kind of more visceral embodied narrative what it's turned into though is more of a project that's been inspired by integral thinking or developmental thinking so I think in one sense is trying to promote a developmental shift both in society recognising the importance of psychological growth but also that the psychological elements actually start to be integrated into political discussion that we make the personal political that we understand the ways in which our psychology our shadow our biases frame how we see the world and that by actually you know growing in that domain we can actually outgrow those our problems or expand our way of seeing things so that's the first shift to developmental shift and the other is a dialectical shift it's kind of realizing the limits of if only the left were more organized communicated better did better grassroots organizing that we would win and it's a recognition that hold on a second like there's a whole other half of the population that has just a different mixture of Moral Sentiments and like how do we actually integrate them how do we bring them into a dialectic and find the synthesis so it's an attempt to both bring your developmental shift in a dialectical shift and we've been doing that through gatherings and bring people together to have those discussions for better or worse and now the media channel is an attempt to model that kind of thinking in in the public space and so the Russell Brand Jordan Peterson video was an attempt to go look here are two big public figures they're grounded in like real spiritual psychological ethos and yet they're on different points of the spectrum and they're in some kind of convivial dialogue let's let's use that as a starting point and make sense of where where they are and even though we did reach a conclusion on Peterson from our perspective he doesn't go far enough we need more the idea more is just to give people a more expanded idea of the space and for them to form their own opinion mmm because I guess I mean we've worked together on one of the alter ego gatherings and this this sort of general idea that we need to bring in a deeper level of political discussion we need to reintegrate what I would have said back then the spiritual I think since since really diving deeply into Jordan Peterson's thought I'd now kind of recognize also the value of religion as well which I haven't done quite so much before I think I really kind of understand the value of these kind of deep encoded stories and mythologies of spirituality rather than just the sort of the transition spirits to the transcendent experience so that's been an interesting journey for me and I also had a really real felt sense from the beginning of the project that there's a there's a tension between and this is also where in the UK the the British Labour Party as well came out of both marks and Methodism that there's a there's a sense of and there's a sense of what are your initial axioms because if you if you've come from a position of kind of like the Marxist idea that we're mainly talking about material conditions or you come from a conditioning 'full life a life that yeah it's it's a it's more of a spiritual or religious origin it's like those two things I think any conversation around this issue in progressive circles is going to have a slight awkward tension between those two things can I add another axiom that I think is really important in this is that the Marxist materialist frame also has a power dynamic at its center it's about capital versus labor it's an oppressor class versus depressed which like I believe that analysis holds out but with a spiritual perspective or a psychological perspective there also is that realization that every person in that dynamic is suffering on some level all of us are wounded all of us are playing out dynamics from her childhood and it adds in a just more spaciousness around that and a possibility of some kind of resolution rather than the dominant frame in Marxism which is counter hegemony and again I'd also do believe there is a place for counter hegemony and there are powerful individuals and systems in place that are damaging and they need to be contested but I also think that one of the the brilliant aspects of the spiritual is this greater compassion for the individual no matter where position they occupy in the hierarchy and I think this is this is something that Jordan Peterson talks about and I really recognize as being a fundamental difference is I think a lot of people implicitly accept a set of axioms about necessarily knowing that they do and that for me is the issue with the identity politics left is that they implicitly accept the axioms of collectivism they implicitly accept the axioms of kind of privat that the language around sort of white privilege and your your that your group identity is more important than your individual identity and that's happens at a very sort of subtle level whereas actually what Peterson for me is bringing back as a sense of no we have two primary accent axiom has to be the divinity of the individual and that's something that we've evolved over millennia and we're in danger of throwing that out with the bathwater because we have this very well-meaning idea that a prep the dominant narrative should be oppression which should be seeing therefore we're seeing people through their group identity rather than their individual identity so I I would slightly disagree or at least maybe offer another perspective so you have like Toulouse and Qatari who were like kind of famous post modernist theorists who would say that the individual is dead and it's the dividual it's the transpersonal individual that lives in relational context and the idea of this binary between the individual and the group and the and Peterson kind of really bringing the individual back I think that it's a it's a false dichotomy and I think that we need to I'm basically just introducing that as a more as a concept for us to hold rather than seeing the two things in tension but it's like for me it's like it's a both and it's very clear that if the group becomes all-important that can lead to all kinds of tyrannies and and kind of the collective ethos sweeping over like 20 century is like to some degree that story and there is a need for individual agency within that but there also within that that feels like it can become just very I and Randy and I suppose has this sense that it's the individual on there kind of Nietzsche and journey of manifestation if it feels very masculine male centric and maybe less feminine and relational and and I don't have a conclusion on that I'm more just introducing more frames well for me it's like it's an incomplete story the individualism story is for me correct but it's incomplete but my sense and this is from personal growth and my sort of spiritual journey is that by going really really deeply into my own process like really identifying my own sort of limiting beliefs on my own kind of conditioning on my own wounds or whatever kind of and as I have fixed those more and more I feel in increasingly firstly that I feel more in a position of of contact with other people like I think that's the catch-22 I think that's the paradox that we start to kind of decide well either it's individual or it's our collective and we the left prioritizes the group and the right prioritize the individual for me the resolution is no it's only by really individuating really going deeply into ourselves and really kind of becoming ourselves giving birth to ourselves as jung talked about then we have the potential for genuine contact and genuine collaboration and if we jump to that space of no we're all we're all part of the tribe we can collaborate together often what comes out is real shadow stuff and like it's that that for me is like the catch-22 we go deeply deeply deep into our own process and then we find we're all the same person looking out through different eyes and it's a direct embodied feeling of connection rather than trying to kind of create this disconnection which maybe hasn't manifested naturally yeah so I totally agree with all of that and I think that if we look at this from an evolutionary perspective like why has Jordan Peterson come on the scene right now why is his message resonated so it's I like reject that it's purely because of fragile masculinity and you know this you know the he's the intellectual we deserve that's kind of the the the the sentiment on the left i I do think that in from an integral perspective it's a correction of a lower tier that the individual does have to individuate because if it just leaps straight to post-modernism Universal collectivism its lost and so I do think that Peterson is a really necessary stage on the journey but we need to move fast and we need to start in reintegrating that with greater and greater I suppose ultimately the wholeness both on an individual level but also on a collective and maybe the danger is that yes we all have to go through our individual journey of self-actualization but because that takes place within a broadly speaking individualistic culture it it's the classic critique of spirituality it just ends up as narcissism and and again this is a point that Jonathan Rosen raised in his paper is that you know the true self actualization is often born out in service to community in service to the greater whole that you're a part of and as well as the question is does does Peterson's narrative orientations towards that way do we see it resolving the systemic crisis that we face in the world and that's maybe where I feel like potentially doesn't go far enough I think he would argue that if enough people got themselves together then those systemic crises would would be a lot easier to solve which I mean I I agree with that I also think that there is probably a place beyond him pointing to yeah but I but I really feel like we can't jump there and I think most yeah I think most of what we're saying at the moment is it kind of jumping beyond not not doing the work not doing the the kind of the deep work of self responsibility of really kind of identifying he send a couple of really interesting thing as me with me how do you know that you're not avoiding your personal responsibility and people on the left go now I'm not avoiding my personal responsibility said how do you know pay really close attention don't just dismiss it how do you know because personal responsibility is an incredibly difficult thing to take like full personal responsibility for everything that you've done in your life really and it was a kind of really interesting moment it's like yeah how that's a lifelong process it is a lifelong process and and also I think that it's I think that the idea that we need to like fully mature and get to that place of self-actualization before we get to collective issues is a it just given where we are in this moment in history I think that that's not a good option I think that we do radically need to do that inner work and it needs to express itself in really tackling global problems that we face and I also think that like some credit needs to be given that like it's easy to characterize the left as a bunch of materialist who haven't an inner work but like if you look at people in all circles there's lots of people who are doing lots of inner work and they are involved in broadly left-wing causes and they do can recognize when a group dynamic is getting toxic and I do think that there is a growing constituency that are doing both and yeah maybe that there is more of an emphasis on the the systems change thinking and less on individual work and they haven't done a proper self examination of their shadow but like you know you also have to work with what you have and I think that again I do think that a in the in the kind of the evolution that the individual does and some level need to be recalibrated but then it's like right and then let's go or we will have a pretty shitty context for the individual to operate in 50 years yeah which is an interesting in one of the interviews we did with Jamie wheel he made this comment about but specifically identity politics because he has been involved in these kind of in these social change or really big projects and what he found was that they got taken down why he was he describes it as he was very he assumed that everyone basic outside the old right was kind of an okay guy or an okay person until they he basically said he was kneecaps from the left which he never expected and it was because the problem with identity politics is it stops you from even moving forward because if you're act him say well we can't move forward until we've got a hundred percent representation we can't move forward until we've got we've made sure that every single voice is being heard we can't move forward until the the the list is endless because the number of people that would need to be involved in this particular conversation would be would be astronomical before you can even move forward and I think that is the issue for me on the left is that we have this very toxic worldview when it's taken to an extreme that actually is pretty much kneecapping a lot of the the police or tential positive social movements so again I agree with you like it's deconstructing by nature its art is in pointing out the flaws it's it kind of inimicable to going out there initiating there was a really good example of the Swedish initiative which was a new political party that is inspired by meta modern thinking The New Yorker did a piece on them and they had just so much promise so many tons of people and then it just took a couple of voices to throw out like somewhat unsubstantiated accusations of sexist misogynist behavior and the whole project was just like torpedoed it's just so easy to do that so I do recognize that and also that they're you know identity politics is a spectrum and there is like really extreme versions that are like that and there's also mature and thoughtful versions and I think that like we have plenty of people who are really involved in intersectional activism and identity politics in our circles and like it is fascinating to to talk to them about like what is a mature thoughtful identity politics look like you know even just a simple like shift in thinking from calling out to calling in so there has been a big culture of calling out you know white male privilege which essentially has been shaming and you know really negative towards a new culture of in a very sensitive way highlighting a person's experience of maybe being marginalized in a group setting someone taking up too much space and calling it in so like this I think also it's so easy to have this particular extreme caricature of identity politics and also not to forget that it's it serves the interest from my perspective for someone on the left it serves the interests of people who are on the far-right and fascists for more and more and more of us to have this extreme caricature of identity politics and therefore to dismiss it inside line it and I think we have to be very careful about when we're talking about an identity politics just to arts as at least to honor that there is a spectrum so yeah I thought you're gonna make a different point there which is the identity politics serves the far right and because I think it does is this is a problem what I mean basically the left is creating a situation where they're making your group identity the most important thing about you and what is going to happen is the far the far right are gonna say well okay then we'll play identity politics and we'll win because there's more of us this is terrifying yeah so I agree that that it does fuel the right and the right plays on that by highlighting the caricature that more and more kind of mainstream soft left liberal groups are now identifying with like I think that there was a real culture a moment when Jonathan PI did his four-minute brilliant comedy piece on identity politics and you know there was that collective yes we can finally rip the  out of this you know but also you know underneath it is like decades of genuine analysis about the ways in which people experience advantage and disadvantage and we shouldn't be throwing the baby out with the bathwater you're really considering that very carefully because it's very easy to wade in with very little understanding take this kind of caricature and then go when you know the left needs to get his house in order and I think that that is yeah but I I mean I think of sort of Eric and Brett Weinstein because they're they're both Bernie Sanders supporters very kind of interesting thoughts about the left first thing I'd sort of reframe it and I think if Pete if Peterson talked about it like this I think people would understand his kind of critiques of identity politics a little bit better it's like it's okay to like equality fairness is a good value if you make it your primary axiom it leads to madness which is what Eric Weinstein said it's like you cannot build a cosmology out of a theory of oppression it leads to insanity which is which is I think a good way of pulling it apart like know these values that you hold they are good they are valuable they need to be part of the conversation if you make them your primary axioms we've seen what happens in history it generally turns into turns into hell on earth but the other point like I would say the left does need to get its house in order like I said I think what we are seeing at the moment is a kind of civil war within the left where we had this kind of oppression narrative taking over until it's the only dialogue in town so I do actually think that the left does need to put its house in order and I think that's the healing that needs to happen like it really does need to be which is why I think what you're doing as well with the with kind of making films about Jordan Peters and saying how something useful to offer the left is a really valuable conversation to have yeah so I agree the left doesn't need to get its house in order and maybe again bring in the principle of the frame you brought in at the beginning which is how do we include and transcend rather than rejecting and I do think it does involve doing the work of really listening to that experience and and and and honoring not just the caricature but actually the real genuine analysis and genuine sentiment that's there while also recognizing it is hostile to like a genuine empirically driven intellectual inquiry it is a divisive narrative that had to pits everyone as oppressors and oppressed it is an individualizing narrative that balkanized as political groups like all of those things are deeply problematic if we want to bring people on board a vision of transition we share a kind of focus on sort of spiritual development as sort of politics through sort of spiritual lens and through a personal growth personal development lens and I've often thought that kind of and and I guess we both share a kind of skepticism towards realism like I have a real skepticism towards materialism I think it's I think it's a really sort of it saps the soul out of the world and I think it's that ultimately I think is what we're part of the crisis we're seeing at the moment is a crisis of materialism it's a crisis of all of these kind of things falling apart at the same time and implicit for me and what Peterson is saying is an acknowledgment of that and it's a kind of like a lot of the Krait the most intractable social crises that we're seeing say I use the example of the opioid crisis in America where you have an incredible number of people like self numbing because they can't for me it's like it's the MOT it's the spiritual emptiness of late-stage capitalism that's making a lot of our social crises worse and I think implicit in a lot of what Peterson is saying is an acknowledgment of that and I think if he was to make that explicit and say yeah a lot of the crises we're seeing our spiritual crises not Material crises material the material realm is actually a subset of the the realm of the soul and the realm of the being and he does believe that because I asked him and he said yes but he doesn't say that and I think if he was to say that if he was to frame his message in that way I think a lot of people on the progressive left would suddenly say he he is saying the same thing that we're saying because I think he is but I think he's got so caught into this reactivity against identity politics that a lot of things he could be saying that would allow more people to see him as now lying I swallowed up and a way that you know do you resonate with that do you think that's that would you if he said that would that be something you'd agree with yeah I would absolutely resonate with it like well this is one of the reasons why we compared him and contrasted with Russell Brand this is essentially the message of Russell Brand has been bringing Russell Brand when he gave that famous interview with Jeremy Paxman was saying I'm not voting because actually what we need is a spiritual revolution and he talks again and again about how our society makes us addicted makes us mentally and well and keeps us from flourishing like that is the fundamental political diagnosis for me but I do think that to rectify that there is a certain amount of material conditions that need to be there that does require what might be deemed as progressive adjustments to policy to things like equality and I think that's potentially where let's say more people on the left or me and Peterson would diverge and and and maybe we can watch this and then we can analyze that afterwards and the sticking point that I hear a lot from my sort of more progressive friends is you all sort of primary focus is on the individual yeah well that's that's too bad for them because the primary focus should be on you know I can agree with that but what I the the paradox that they would say it's like okay focus on the individual but you have to accept that there are some situations that are much more conducive to an individual thriving than other situations and so their focus is on structural inequality your focus is on the individual is there not some interplay between oh definitely well obviously because people do have group identities the question is whether whether the group or the individual identity should be paramount and the left distanc the radical leftist answer is well there is the look it's not me that's failing to take into account those two levels of analysis it's the bloody radical leftist because for them it's the collective and that's that and so it's obvious as far as I'm concerned that people have their individuality and then behind that they have there they have their group by multiple group identities which is also a big problem but all separately or any of these situations that make it much more difficult for people to self actualize well what I think they'd argue is they don't hear you talk about that very much well it isn't first of all it's not self-evident like I'm not I don't accept Maslow's hierarchy of needs I don't think it's necessarily more difficult for people who are poor to self-actualize sorry I don't buy that you because what that would mean think about what that would mean that would mean that the rich are morally superior that's what that means because they have all the opportunities to self actualize so obviously if the material conditions are the prerequisite for self-actualization then the rich are morally superior to the poor is that really an argument we want to make and in fact I don't think that that's even even vaguely reasonable because one of the things that does help build character is privation now obvious starving to death is an an excess of privation so there are limit conditions but the it's a leftist trope that the provision of additional material resources will produce ethically superior human beings sorry not true and in fact sometimes quite the contrary so-so so I don't I don't I don't buy that argument in the least I also think that under most circumstances accepting those of exceptional privation and even perhaps under those conditions in most is in most cases your best bet to move people forward is to concentrate on the development of their individual character and their individual their individual moral character fund because moral character is actually your moral character is actually the set of tools that you have to operate effectively in the world because otherwise morality would be of no utility and morality is in some sense precisely that way which is of maximal utility and so and and the other objection that I would throw it at the radical left is how do you know that your Oh your emphasis on collective existence isn't just an abdication of your personal responsibility well of course it's not it's like no no no seriously here it's not that easy to adopt personal responsibility maximal personal responsibility what makes you think you're not running away from it you have every reason to you really have that stellar moral character really that's that's your self analysis it's like sorry I don't buy it and I especially don't buy it when I look at the consequences of leftist revolutions because all these people of stellar moral character when they undertake their collectivist revolution nothing comes out of that but absolute bloody catastrophe so so all the well-meaning aims aside I found this really interesting because implicit I think even and it really landed for me when Peterson made this comparison with Maslow's hierarchy of needs which is kind of the simplified way of saying okay once you've got your material needs set then you can move up to your social needs and then the top is like self-actualization so we're sort of saying you need to have many of the other things put together before you can move to self-actualization and Peterson was challenging that and saying no because then what you're basically saying is self-actualization like moral virtue more all kind of yeah moral virtue is only available to people at the top of society which I'd never heard before and actually kind of floored me when I heard it what did you make of it well I think that he is right that it it's not that we give everyone we make society more material equally equal and then all of a sudden everyone is self actualizing that's that's simply not true very wealthy sectors of society constant development as much as very poor area of society because they have cultures in a way that are inimical to to growth so I would say that it's not an either/or it's about it's about understanding the optimal level of support and of challenge both of those things are really important so people who are in potentially more deprived settings might have adversity that is hugely character-building but if it's too much adversity if literally there isn't just an overwhelming set of constraints and the individual it far from inducing growth it can be suboptimal for any kind of development I think that there's a basic with a spiritual progressive political critique of this is the idea that we do need more material conditions for really spiritually and psychologically growing a lot of them are just around having the time and the space and the freedom to reflect on ourselves even just to be able to do courses like I think about like some of the core things that have made a difference to my development doing of a pasta that's a 10-day meditation that is a luxury if you are working on a minimum wage in two jobs to take ten days off if you've got two children that is a complete privilege and luxury of time and space and in an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru that is a complete luxury of having enough money to fly to the other side the world for ayahuasca is legal and do it there so I think that like there are if we think about in our spiritual progressive culture it is a very privileged space it's a very it's does all of these workshops that you can do from shadow work to Tantra all of which cost an arm and leg to most people and that is a that is a purely material material barrier to entry to higher levels of development and growth and so for me that's where that's where it comes from is that if you if you know yes 12 out what you want to prioritize in your life as well yeah there is there is individual agency and that and if you really really do want to grow you could be in any place and you could get to a better place and I think Peterson does talk about how we use our social context our culture our societies as an excuse to actually like get your together like do it but at the same time if we're thinking about a society how do we like to run society we would like like for us an alter ego we our vision is a deliberately developmental Society all institutions from family community health service legal justice system the economy itself is geared towards the development of the self does that mean that we radically redistribute everyone so ever it has the same well no if the empirical research proved for peterson is saying which is that that isn't the correct conditions but not a materialist you're then imposing a materialist frame on that i'm saying that there if you're if you're talking about distributing material goods it is a degree that i think that there does need to be a certain material threshold to give people literally call my universal baker bingham but basic income or something like that yeah that that might be an example like it's it's used as an example of how it helps with job matching in the economy where people just have more time and space to go hmm what's the next best move do i go for this job or do i take some education whereas currently there is literally no time and space you just get the next job if you're in a lower rung of society so you know progressive employment law the amount of hours that you have to work the you're paid all these things like I see it as do you have cognitive bandwidth to engage in deeper levels of inquiry to engage in your own development it's so so and it's a it's a hopefully a yes and or a both and it's saying for me spiritual and psychological growth as a priority there is a material dimension that requires a progressive politics to really challenge particularly vested interests that are hoarding lots of money and that needs to be distributed I guess my perspective would be but what came up when I was hearing you talk was just a sort of sense that I think that the blocks there's what what I was hearing was a certain kind of sense of if we just gave people enough space they would make better decisions I have a sense that the kind of the psychological traps that we create for ourselves are often much deeper than that and so for me I guess the sort of going beyond like like I think Peterson's focus on the individual is absolutely necessary like it's a it's the right place to start and if you're going to have a set of axioms empowering the individual and starting from a place of like radical personal responsibility or radical kind of self self-awareness and there's a kind of humility as well I really like about Peterson as well if there's a real humility in accepting you don't know that what you don't know is as important as what you do in a real sense of kind of respect for that which I think it's really valuable compared to like for example the sam Harris's or the materialists which is sort of like no we know everything oh we can work everything out so I think there's a there's a sort of starting point I think it's I think it's the right place to start I think what's really helped me is like personal growth didn't get quite so much Maya Wesker but but definitely there are there are things that I got a lot a lot from in terms of personal growth and therapeutic interventions and I think giving people that is really important I know for example my I'll digress slightly my mother and my father had very I was I was brought up in a very left-wing house my father was very sort of straight down the line Guardium Reid they both read The Guardian they're both sort of Guardian Reid see nd marching people my mum went through a process of real difficulty she started working in a in a poor school in Southampton and what she found really difficult so she had a lot more interactions with the actual like they both wanted to help the downtrodden the the poor what in my dad in a very sort of abstract way my mum in our very real kind of working in one of the most deprived areas and schools in Southampton she had something of a of a real awakening because what she realized was that a lot of the parents didn't necessarily want their kids to succeed or not on a subconscious level not not outwardly but she would be kind of seeing something in this child like wow you could really clear at the University and the parents would come in and like no the system's biased no my child none of us have been to university and and really found this kind of like either either either conscious or subconscious like because if their child succeeded it would challenge them set their Center themselves the fact that the system was biased against them the fact that the world didn't work for people like them all this stuff and it happens it's such a subconscious level and this is what I see is the real difficulty with like the real value of psychological growth and real sort of psychological intervention is that it can potentially shift some of those paradigms but the real difficulty and the real problem with the left is that it equates poverty or oppression with moral virtue and that's a real issue because if you do that what you don't realize and that the paradox that most people on the left is that they love the poor in the abstract but they hate them in the particular and they hate everything they believe they hate before than they think they hate the nationalism they hate all of the things they actually think so it's like for me for me I think we all have our shadows and I think the shadow of like what we're seeing at the moment with brexit and Trump is the shadow of liberalism is like the shadow of yeah we're really inclusive apart from all these people we hate so for me the psychological growth work needs to happen everywhere I don't I don't see I I think we all have our psychological traps in in every area of society the Liberals have their psychological traps in it's now coming to bite them in the ass with with with brexit and Trump and and there are yeah so I see it as a more complex thing and I think that message of personal responsibility that really really identify your resentments really do the work of really looking at where you're where you're holding back or where you're judging people or where and we all have this I think that's the right place to start for me I still think Peterson is the right place to start because if you don't then your shadows are gonna be sort of manifest in everything that you're doing yeah and I think that maybe what I hear in that what you're saying is that you and Peterson is saying as well you can't just throw money at a culture of you know underachievement or lacking and taking personal responsibility it'll just continue you and I can and how do you actually intervene at any level whether it's like a culture of underachievement in poorer parts of society if it's like a culture of moral superiority in liberal circles but I do think that maybe the future isn't is a combination of both so I'll just give you a just a practical example in the RSA wrote a report on basic income and it wasn't just getting like the actual numbers right about how much to distribute it was also putting together a conditional response mechanism where people would voluntarily contribute in the community in society in exchange for the money so it wasn't it wasn't like you're not going to get the money until you do it but there was a certain set of interventions that would create the conditions for people to more likely to experience a kind of a more service orientated citizenship led identity in the absence of work in the future where there's full automation so I do think that maybe there is a sort of generosity and boundaries at the same time which is a the issue that we often now yeah and and and and again but I do think you can have a you know let's say for example a welfare state that really emphasizes psychological growth work that isn't just about healing but it is about get your together but there is resources to do it which is generally speaking more likely to come from the left and from progressives who believe in actually investing in public services so again it's how do we marry this really important message individual responsibility to break through these very entrenched cultures and how do we actually galvanize broadly speaking left-wing and progressive sources to actually fund it and to make it happen and that's for me I think the the opening that I see with Peterson I think in this and other conversations we've had we've clearly got sort of different like we we have different priorities in terms of kind of our perspectives like personal responsibility or social change but I think we ultimately come from the same place in that we like I definitely believe in the value of structure I believe in the value of government I believe that a political project based around personal growth has a real chance of succeeding like I really do think that that's something that's worth worth having and then holding the tension of but it comes down to the individual responsibility at the same time and this kind of realization of okay we need to give people the opportunities but ultimately we can't encourage people to take them yeah and just an overcoming of the developmental blindness of policy like what a bankrupt idea to think if we just threw more money into the welfare state understands that that we'll be able to tackle a cultural issue like it's a joke it's more that we need serious psychological support and psychological intervention to equip people to support themselves on their own journey of becoming so it is again it is is it's something that is enabled by a collective decision to really pool resources in a certain area but with an emphasis on actually where it is likely to be effective which is that the individual psychological and even spiritual level if we can manage to get there right thank you very much thank you
