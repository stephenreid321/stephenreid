so this is the first rebel wisdom Q&A we announced earlier in the week and asked you guys to put your questions underneath the video and then to vote up the questions that you wanted answered so what we've discovered is that our audience is far smarter than us and they've asked us questions that we maybe won't be able to answer but we'll do what we can so we're basically going to time this and it will be an hour and we'll answer definitely answer the first 12 questions and then we'll start going down below that and work out depending on how much time we've got that will decide how many questions have been asked to answer so first and so the 12 top questions we're not necessarily going to answer them the order that they were that they're they were ranked but we're going to answer all all 12 of them and starting with the ones that we know that we can answer moving on to the ones that we're really struggling with you can't decide yourselves when that moment comes hmm so Allie why do you use the Black Sun as a logo what does it mean to you cuz it looks cool Cleo the first thing to say it's not the place it's not a Black Sun or no Sun it's the eye and the triangle yes exactly yeah and for me the eye represents the I guess the transformative power of true knowledge inner knowledge truth in general and yeah it's so combined it has that sense for me and I know what are your feelings on our logo I so from the beginning when we were trying to put the logo together the idea was I was listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson stuff at the time and the idea of the it was the eye and the pyramid the pyramid or the the triangle being truth logos the dominance hierarchy all that sort of stuff and the eye meaning awareness and the eye there's actually a little clip that I might dig out and see if we can play where I the logo - Jordan Peterson during my first interview and he was like yeah that's perfect you've got it because it's the eye it's the awareness but it's the eye and the Sun in the pyramid that you worship not the pyramid itself it's the regenerating factor that the awareness is consciousness effectively it's the consciousness that is that is then able to update the structure that we should be worshipping not the destructor itself don't know if you saw the logo that we've put together forever wisdom and recognize the eye and yep and the triangle yeah perfect we were looking for an abstract kind of way that didn't look too Illuminati there's a little bit Illuminati but not quite right so much yeah well that's the thing is that it's the it's the Sun in the pyramid that you worship not the pyramid right because the Sun is the thing that in both senses that stops it from being the patriarchy so that's the thing that you can have a relationship with that it transcends the dominance hierarchy itself yeah it is it is it's it's it's it like in the Lion King that there's that little bird Zazu well he flies above everything sees everything that's the eye that's the Egyptian eye it's outside the structure it's the thing that moves up and down the structure and it repairs it that's what consciousness does in your body it's it moves up and down levels of of reality let's say and and alters them so in it's so it's outside the structure and it's also the thing that gives rise to the structure but the structure also gives rise to it that's why there's Trinitarian ideas in Christianity you know there's the father and the son and they're mutually causal think well how can that be well the son gives birth to the father obviously because boys turn into men but the father also gives birth to the son and so that's part of the reason that those Trinitarian ideas exist yeah when we were putting the logo together the only kind of brief that we were kind of clear on is it can't look too Illuminati because obviously you're starting as you start to the pyramids and I getting into kind of the dollar bill territory in your life okay it can't be Illuminati and the head and he actually got it done and it was like yeah that looks perfect it's great I'm one of the first comments workers why why is your logo there but my favorite comment ever or no in our films is what was it it salute your logo is Illuminati as but you seem legit which i think is about as good as it gets yeah really yeah I really love that idea I'm just think remembering something that was actually involve under clays sermon but don't think we've put out this particular bit of it that really stuck with me the whole idea of being able to step out of the structure of the hierarchy whatever it is and regenerate it and have a different perspective on it is really it's a really deep idea you know he talked about Jesus washing the feet of the disciples of his disciples and that being a an action that kind of took him or could have inverted everything on his head and took him out of the dominance hierarchy game altogether really interesting and there's the the top becomes the bottom and that's the kind of regeneration of the structure exactly yeah and then there's this is very famous alchemical image called the I really hope I pronounced it right but we can we can probably put it up on screen the telling me Ron tell a Marion I think with a lot of people will be aware of it it's the kind of the initiate climbing through one sphere into the heavens if you neutral I'm talking about they're kind of on there yeah we can put it up though but I love that kind of alchemical idea of knowledge in general can give us a completely new perspective on reality and for me the logo holds some of that kind of symbolism in it as well go so that's the story the logo so question two questions yeah so question two is from sorry so question one by the way was from the dashing rogue question two is from and I'm going to try and pronounce this correctly apologies it was wrong land be art so what do you to see as the Telos or end of all this Peterson slash intellectual dark web stuff what is the goal to ultimately justify and direct this collective intellectual endeavor hmm great question it's a great question because I think a lot of people involved in this conversation probably have different ideas about what the end goal is I think Peterson I mean the end it's like at the moment the ID w's end goal or the the goal right now for the idea W is to carve out a space to have a conversation where it goes from there I think different members of the IDW have different concepts of where it goes from there and I think that there is a hope yeah they do hope that it can that having that conversation can begin to find the solutions that will what would you say kind of change society or deal with deal with the essential threats that we're dealing with I mean they've got very big ideas definitely yeah and I especially look like specially I'm thinking the Weinstein yeah ticular yeah Weinstein and Bret Weinstein they do they seem to be holding one of the the most farsighted pieces in the IDW yeah I think Peterson has a slightly different focus he's much more focused on the individual and the the transformative power of coming into your true alignment yet then as a priority and then that itself becomes the he sees that as the main seat of transformation rather than the structural in that yeah and I'm still not entirely clear on his kind of the relationship between that and that and the widest structures of society yeah I'm not entirely sure either on that point yeah I agree with you I think one aspect of it is definitely that the kind of conversation that is happening now in the IDW gets integrated into the wider I guess into lots of different institutions that are you know which is something arguably that needs to happen for us to be able to move forward effectively so in that sense that's I hope what in a sense maybe it's happening already or the beginnings of it are personally I mean in terms of the question of where's the end of it I don't know I have no idea where I would like it to go is to quite is to open the space for a more integral way of seeing the world so that's something for example like sam Harris Jordan Peterson though it's not one winning its that both it's holding a kind of resolution that allows for different aspects that allows for the material that allows for the spiritual that allows for the biological and the artistic and kind of you know for me that's what the great intellectual awakening is it's it's creating a space that is less polarized not just politically but also in our our values of yeah what we value is good thinking in a sense I mean it's an interesting question as well because I have a sense of where I feel the intellectual integration would go and also a sense of that actually it needs to be more than intellectual integration it needs to incorporate sort of the more embodied forms of knowing the more transformational spaces so and I'm still not sure whether I'm projecting that on to the IDW conversation like assuming that they would also share a similar idea because I don't think they necessarily do but I see that there's a great quote that begins a book the epilogue of passion of the Western mind by Richert Arnaz brought by Robert Bellah and he talks about we may be seen in the paraphrase and maybe I can put it up on mine up on screen but something like we may be seeing the beginnings of a reintegration of consciousness it will not be based on any single unit univocal understanding of reality it'll recognize that we have to ship between different imaginative vocabularies and that we have a propensity to fit to slip into one literal interpretation of the world so we need to be eternally alert to that so it's this sense that Peterson's Jungian map work yeah Brett's evolutionary map works they map onto each other they reconcile like lots of different people in the IDW have different parts of the puzzle I also think that's probably a few other people who are not considered part of the IDW at the moment that probably if that is the nature of the conversation will have to come into it at some point kind of future like I think for example Jamie wheel we didn't interview with I think is still one of the best interviews we've done is holding such an important piece of what that what the embody transformational work that we would have to do to be able to yeah ultimately the one we're stuck and not seeing things from another person's perspective or we're not able to understand all there's some kind of block often it's because we're we're holding on to something at a deeper level like a psycho like this you know some belief or some yeah childhood conditioning or something like that it's like and and that ultimately like that's the only genuine reconciliation I can see is when we're bringing in the whole person or when bringing in yeah we're bringing in to the other levels of knowledge as well as just the intellectual yeah I'm also just closing on that point I'm gonna slightly contradict myself from earlier because yeah the I think it's about the reenactment of the world is this a phrase that kind of used sometimes about bringing a meaning back into the world so at the same time as holding a more integral perspective so it's not necessarily that there's this equivalency of like everything has a piece of the puzzle that's not necessarily true I think truth is still the kind of thing that determines the direction and we're all the maps converge so I just wanted to clarify that and yeah that is there's also you know what you were just talking about being able to hold different perspectives at the same time that feels that feels absolutely essential and for me it's completely wrapped up in creating a more psychologically psycho spiritually aware society in a sense orally or you know intellectual movement let's say as well cool okay Ally I would love this is this question is from Adele Sumi adults are summe I would like to hear what pieces of art you regard as a highest human achievement that you know of no no messing around in category of raising oneself closer to God and your opinion on music and your perspective on its effects on consciousness individual and social so it's for a bit cheeky it's it's meaty I'm I'm gonna be a bit cheeky and not answer it with one particular piece of art because I tried I kind of sat there and thought I'm a lot more I'm not so into visual art I can really appreciate it but for me there are that really that I really connect with tends to be literature and music so I'm gonna blend a few things together so pieces of art you regard as a highest human achievement then you know all that in the category of raising one's self closer to God so I think music has that power maybe more than and it'll be different for every person but for me more than most other art forms music has this especially music song live or song all together or play together so I play traditional Irish music I can pubs and even that I wouldn't say that's like a deep mystical experience but it's really a beautiful flow state so in that sense like music really yeah really gets me into a state of flow and I think most people especially in a really good concert or gig or whatever it is that's why you know actually Jamie real talks about that I'm stealing fire it's like that's one of the reasons we really love music you know it gets us into that into that space I'm also big fan of visionary art so art that's created based on the visionary experience which might be drug-induced it might be you know some people do from lucid dreams it can be all sorts I think that's really profound and powerful because that's coming directly from an altered space and it's kind of made with that space in mind I think art is I've always been really interested in the idea of art as a drug and how can art become and is in some way a drug in and of itself that it actually puts you in a different state and I find that concept about art in general I think any art that manages to do that and people have that experience looking at Renaissance paintings as well you know so I think that's when it's that's when it plays that role of getting us in your words you know closer to God or closer to the transcendent or whatever you want to call it so yeah that's my scattered thinking on that very deep question your thoughts I'm gonna just throw a little curveball in and say that what I find myself spending most of my time listening to and I I i also think music this there's something about music that is it also fits with what peterson talks about that out that meaning is a primary sanitation yeah well meaning is not something that happens secondarily meaning or something that there's very very prime at primary yeah and music i think speaks to that because it it's a it's a believe oak meaning and it but able to evoke emotion was reliably and it's like why does it poke those emotions it's it's it's somehow tapping quite directly into yeah in time meaning systems some of the curveball i was going to throw in is that I'm a massive fan of rap and I love I love the fact that it is there's something about the way it just ties everything together that's the port the thing that they're often rapping about is more and more lyrically dextrous ways of talking about how in the flow in that particular moment they are like it's very self referential but they're I'm very performative and the best rap really conscious really self-aware really kind of just in that state of flow I find just really powerful I love it and of the best piece of art that I've been most impressed with the pieces of art that we're most impressed with over the last couple of years probably Kendrick Lamar's good kid maad city and then to pimp a butterfly I wasn't as taken with damn although he kind of won a lot more Awards for that but in good kid maad city in particular there is it's got the depth of a novel it's got the depth of a characterization and the metaphors the way that it refers it basically about one day and it continually refers back to itself it's an absolute masterpiece and I was obsessed as you're probably very like a couple years ago it's like obsessed with Kendrick Lamar I was telling everyone who glisten look this is a masterpiece this is listen this is this is a great novel in musical form and I feel a little bit vindicated like people were just saying to us with kind of the model and he want to pull that he's now won a Pulitzer for yeah for the his work and that I'm like yeah I'm glad that he's getting that kind of recognition I'm glad people are actually realizing that there's a there's an incredible lyrical storyteller there and I don't I don't see many other artists on that level at the moment doing what he's doing but yeah oh oh yeah I won't say that's the highest human achievement I know of but that's good yeah five and Julian what says I'm wondering how you distinguish your and presumably Peterson's position on religion from people like Sam Harris on one hand and people like pull them to clay on the other I assume you'd agree more with Harris than the vendor clay about the ontological status of events like the resurrection if so what is the real difference between your positions do you see psychological value and religion at sam Harris does not thanks also a very good question yeah and I mean yeah it's a really good question and at this point I assume you would agree more with Harris than with van der clay about the ontological status of events like the resurrection so speaking for me personally probably yes I would say to that if however it's a complex question because something like the resurrection gets into the world of you know myth and symbolism and what does the resurrection actually represent psychologically so you know that's kind of where where my interests lie in terms of religion like the word religion is also a tricky one because my spiritual practice is usually based around phenomenology it's actually it's experiential so I'm not I'm not really big on belief I think faith is important but that's like a whole other topic there's some things that are unknowable in a sense but belief I've always been skeptical of because for me it's about having a religious experience or say a spiritual experience or a peak mystical experience or whatever it might be and bringing my own individual sovereignty to integrating it and figuring out okay how do i how me my ego how do i integrate this what do I make of this and that's always been my my way so I probably have yeah I probably do have a I'm not sure if I'm like van der clay or Harris in my perspective on that particular thing yeah hand over to you mmm I I feel like I'm only starting now to really grapple with the Christian story in any kind of meaningful way like we talked to Paul Lander clay I talked with Jonathan page oh the other night and he he had a sort of because because I also heard a few people say that it all hinges on the resurrection and I I'm not entirely sure what that means at the moment but I've heard more than a few people talk about Christianity in that way but if the resurrection is not true then the whole of Christianity falls apart I don't quite understand all of that yet but what I and then when I when I asked that to Jonathan he said something that about that the resurrection is something that happens at the end of time and it happens now and there's some inter relation between the resurrection is always with us and is always happening in some sense I'm paraphrasing probably badly but I think I I think I have a felt sense of what he might mean by that and he was also like I've been very taken by by the Jungian explanation or the Jungian examination of of Jesus as an archetype as kind of in a way it doesn't really matter whether he existed as a person because what he embodies and represents is the ideal person the ideal human and whether that ideal human lived and whether that ideal came whether there have been other people who had the same level of spiritual awareness and spiritual presence that he did there is a sort of moment where that archetype entered the world fully formed and it it means something to all of us and it has had a huge impact on the direction of Western culture in the direction of the world so the whole idea at the very least has a reality there's a really deep resonance and reality the actual state of whether it applies to us to a person what that how that in a way I'm joking that's a particularly interesting question mmm because the interesting questions are what is the nature of this archetype what is the nature of this yeah this archetype that has that has been so influential and I think I don't yet know enough I'm looking forward to kind of having more conversations with people who maybe have more of a deeper understanding of what it means to them yeah I think the problem with wood religion is when they dispense with that when it becomes a dogma it becomes just a set of a set of yeah when the dead word stops being infused with the living sort of inquiry hmm that's where I start to sort of lose patience and they talking cold and it's like I don't really understand what that's about but yeah I think I think one other thing another interesting thing that Jonathan says we're gonna put out Jonathan Pedro's talk we talk for quite a bit longer than the bit we've put out so far but at the same Harris section so we've got another section talking about the value of organized religion and yeah his hairs on my history with Christianity and what I remember from that is his resistance to the Jungian analysis because he didn't think the religious should be reduced to the psychological and I like I'm again paraphrasing but that it's it's not a case of explaining it because if it's if it's religiously archetypal II true then the psychological will be a subset of the kind of the deeper reality if that makes sense yeah yeah definitely I mean this is a huge topic I feel like we could talk about a lot I mean I have a few things bubbling away but I think because we have more content coming out on this and we'll do another Q&A I'm going to sit and Mull it over because it's so big actually and maybe move to the next question yeah which is ah so this is a short one from Peter heads I have a glance out right have you read any CS Lewis apologetics if so what did you think no I haven't and I hated them I also haven't read them and I also hidden it no and we I I certainly haven't I did look it up to see if it would be possible to read in time but it seems like it's quite in and there's a lot to it so thanks for bringing it up it's really good to be aware of but unfortunately can't can't add anything to that mm-hmm there is I don't know obviously I guess most people know CS Lewis the author of Lyon which in the Wardrobe which is a deeply kind of allegorical very Christian story I've heard about these before and I think it yeah I'd like to check them out as well all I know about him is that he was part of a very interesting group of there was a lot going on in the sort of 30s 40s 50s I think yeah in I think it was Cambridge yeah there was a group called the Inklings Tolkien was part of it CS Lewis was part of it couple other people were part of it sort of the very sort of English eccentric intellectual really trying to understand what the what the deeper structure of these kind of mythological stories was yeah and that I've always been sort of quite attracted to to learning a bit more about it like them and I think TS Eliot's as well like a really fascinating character because he was even atheist who wrote these amazing poems like The Hollow Men and then had a Christian then became a Christian later in life there's a lot of there was a lot of interesting stuff and in those life stories I think yeah that's an interesting processed here Elia because modern is it was very much a kind of disenchantment of the world it's called The Waste Land the ways that yeah exactly yeah and and a you know response to world were one in many ways as well around the that the roots of post-modernism come from that of everything we held sacred never came have seemed to be safe and secure was kind of blown to by World War one and then the kind of grappling with that modernist I studied modernist poetry quite a bit and it's got kind of a bleak Beauty to it but I didn't actually kind of forgotten that about Eliot that then there's this kind of revival of meaning that probably I don't know I imagined was like you would have grass with both hands and a lot of people probably would have at that time as well it's an interesting thing - yeah yeah that it's also interesting that that seems to be the last time maybe because of the the nature of the times and maybe that's what we're going through again is some sort of sense of a lot of people compared this time to a bit like the sort of 1930s and 1960s maybe that's when you see these these spiritual awakenings and religious awakenings yeah so if you know the answers no to your question I have to get a nice to kill five minutes out of it so what are we number seven liver so could you is it male you it's you there's some yeah yeah could you do interviews with two people who have different views on the deep issues I think these make the most interesting interactions and if you do it I think conversation is preferable to a debate watching your content also in Israel keep up the good work don't forget muscle the muscle emoticon I don't have a motor oh yeah you do that yes definitely and I think it's a really good shout so we're gonna give your name's it's in Hebrew and we neither of us can read Hebrew but yeah doing interviews of two people have different views and deep issues so I think it's a great format I think again that requires this kind of it's part of why the intellectual dark web works you know there has to be an embodiment on the human level of a certain degree of kind of guess what Jordan green will call inner sovereignty to be able to hold a space and not get into reactivity I think a lot of people can do that so I think it's really yeah great we've been talking a little bit about different ways to do that already so yeah yeah different views and the deeper issues yeah I think it's interesting to me too yeah kind of wonder whether like so far we've been interviewing the people that we want to interview that we're interested in we like their ideas I I'm always interested in who are the people who push you conversations forward I'm not personally interested in interviewing someone when I know what they're going to say hmm I don't find that particularly so I wouldn't I wouldn't want to interview people with different ideas just for the sake of it I think it would have to be when both of them had a had a sense of that there was a genuine inquiry and a genuine to the possibility for evolution of their ideas yeah definitely there's something of in Zen there's beginner's mind where you come without any preconceptions and there's a kind of lack of attachment to your own position and that actually is kind of rare sometimes you know it in academia for example it's very rare if you had two academics defending something that they'd wrote their thesis on spent 30 years lecturing and the worth trying to do what they should be doing is finding some kind of truth that allows their ideas to burn away I think it's very unlikely that that it's very likely when that happens yeah yeah yeah I think the more public profile someone has the harder it is to yeah she'd be generative for sure and next question is from G Thomas a few episodes back you guys were talking about some of the negative press surrounding the intellectual dark web particularly Jordan Peterson an idea was touched on that I thought you might like to expand on it seems the fact that dr. Peterson actually embodies his philosophy to a rare degree is particularly confounding to his detractors the character attacks misrepresentation flat-out lies about him and his message is this evidence of a disdain for not just the individual but also for what he represents I think yes what do you think I think yes yeah I think there's a really interesting concept here which is about congruence and which is about living one's message out in the world because I agree very very few people actually live out their philosophy in the world and to a lesser degree or a similar degree they're actually they're actually is is a representation of the sort of the word psychological necessities on one level like I think it he talked about yawn and the idea of the conjunction yeah something conjunction the conjunction mysterious mysterium conjunction the other mysterio conjunction I think where it's about a deeper and deeper process of embodiment of your ideas in terms of your actions yeah and then a deeper integration of different perspectives and finally I think an integration of the masculine and feminine aspects of oneself that is kind of the process of individuation and I do think that that sense of someone who's really living out their ideas in the world and is living from that very deep place of true accountability and general and genuine like I find a route I find a real yeah real integrity I do think does trigger people who are not living from that place yeah and I think it kind of on some subconscious level calls them out yeah and I think that's that's part of the reactivity to him it's because he's a walking rebuke to people who are not actually living out their philosophy in the world yeah I thought was I think that's wrong because there's especially the kind of message of self responsibility that's what like he said in the recent interview you did a left last week actually not should we put this bit out yet but he does preview he does mention you know especially with with radical people on the left and the example he was using was like have you really taken full ownership of yourself and of your own individuality or are you projecting it outwards that was a question yeah I don't just say yes because it's all hardest things to do so don't assume that you have exactly and that's the point it is constant work like kind of inner growth work and embodiment work it's constant work I means like everyday work and it's also the sense that post-modernism is a like many people I felt this a long time before I even discovered Peterson is it's you get into an argument for someone who claims there is no truth and it's performative contradiction because they're arguing from a perspective there's no truth it's like okay so that's your truth that truth and also that you cannot there are certain things about especially the philosophy post-modernism that you cannot live out in the world yeah you can't you can't spend any time at all believing there's no truth and if you I think this is Jonathan pathos really clever way of framing it's like well if if if you're a dedicated post modernist and I come up to you and I say I've just seen your partner having dinner with someone down the road and they look very intimate you're not gonna say well there was no truth yeah and your body is gonna tell you certain things yes like well yeah I I've got very high sort of share with Peter and a frustration of people who claim to have a philosophy that they're not actually living out in their in their lives yeah that's yeah that's a really good point there's also that this this thing of victimhood culture which is rampant he he stands us completely something that challenges that actually and teaching meditation I I often say the one thing that drops from your vocabulary when you start meditating is I couldn't help it you know this whole thing of like trigger warning so triggered I just can't you know that is that can that can go with practice and I can go with taking personal responsibility for your own inner world and that there was a hard process so it's easier to stay in the victim thing and then to the point you made the beginning of this question then you start projecting it out to wherever you see it embodied the thing you don't have or the thing that you're rejecting is embody just so pushing it out so I think yeah so yes we agree we agree we also force number nine a forbidden question that no one can talk about oh god we shouldn't read over Louise brought this up and I think it's very important question where our women's long form deep insights and opinions about the pieces of movement ie Jungian psychology motivations political issues men's movement open dialog about societal problems etc etc it seems women are not participating in these long form discussions or am i rolling in there in an echo chamber I really want to know the other side of the equation they're deep insights from a female perspective likewise I really want to as well yeah we certainly haven't been actually those question to you oh yeah no but yeah I'm just gonna repeat that as well no it's a really I also I'm really curious about this and that we have you know some amazing women in our circles who are engaged at these type of ideas very happy to talk about them and I wonder if it's a question of the the format of like you know most of the stuff is happening on YouTube people really putting themselves out there whether that's got something to do with it whether these conversations are happening somewhere else whether the confident maybe the conversation around the current form of feminism is so loud that it makes being a woman and saying anything a little bit different like Louise did those previous interviews quite a risky thing to do mmm maybe arguably more risky for a woman than a man I don't know yeah so the next question is from James Carmichael and James you've shortened it a little bit but James tells quite a touching story of having been born with visually impaired and then having experiences in school where you would always have support from the teachers and when you try to talk about that being uncomfortable for you the way it was given they kind of as you put it you were given a shut up because we know what's best look and then you go on to talk about your father passing away when you're 22 and feeling like your own only real masculine anchor was severed said during and after his death my coping mechanism turned it to alcohol smoking and drugs I'm 31 now and really trying putting effort into understanding why I'm like this and what I can do about it and over the last few years I've made some great progress due to jordan peterson and many other figures like that however i can't shake this feeling that i'm wasted my 20s trying to avoid the pain and anger through booze etc and I'm worried that my youth is slowly slipping through my fingers with nothing to show for it they need bison what I could do to accelerate the healing process books practical physical mental exercises etc thanks and sorry for long read no worries man hmm I think this was the question that people voted up the most yes hi and yeah I wanna say thank you for sharing that James and yeah I think the the level of personal insight the already showing by sharing in that way is showing that you're you're on the right track and because there's a lot of people stuck in in pretty crappy situations that can't really articulate it and yeah I think at least being able to articulate is it is a good start I yeah I want to say that like if it's we can we can give a little bit of an advice but if if what you're dealing with the moment is kind of alcohol and and drugs then alcohol and drugs and therapy aana it could be something to look at grief counseling as well because early that you said your father died about nine years ago I certainly found when my father died but I needed to go through some serious yeah getting a letting a lot of the emotions out in terms of like if you're if you're generally pretty stable then I'd say the thing that has been the most rewarding for me is a men's group where we have to teach men's work and we're in a we're in a kind of men's circle together and just to have this space to really speak what's real what's true what's authentic with other men I think is really important and I think men in particular we're now quite aware we can become very isolated and get older and it's very easy for us to become isolated and also I think to look for support in women and girlfriends that actually we need to be finding outside the relationship to resources for the relationship yeah it's not not that we should talk about some things but the balance I think is all wrong if we're looking for all of our sustenance from the entire relationship yeah you end up making your partner like your mom in that sense which is not not the right way to go about it yeah so I would just add to that and like yeah thank you for yeah for communicating now this is courageous thing to do just to echo what David said yeah I mean I think traditional therapies especially the right therapists are very important if it is something that is substance abuse or grief etc and then from a kind of place where you feel stable which you might be already we can't tell just from a comment men's work I would also put in meditation because meditation is really core practice for connecting to yourself for knowing yourself also can be very relaxing if you use it for that too and yeah men circle for sure in terms of books ones that were good for me warrior king magician lover is like one of the original is written in the 70s it's a more modern nineties is the night is okay yeah well it's aged well even well even if it is from the 90s that's a good kind of foundational one and quite accessible and stoicism yeah for sure Marcus Aurelius and yes Stoics as you've already said that Jordan Peterson's helped yeah and the stoic said he's stoic take on life yes that's good yeah do you have any plans to more specifically have integral theory spiral dynamics meta modern discussions with any of the guests you have either prior guests or upcoming ones yes we have actually some solace from kellyco tmh is who asked that we actually have some already recorded integral conversations and are talking about having some more with some pretty significant integral thinkers yeah mysterious yeah yeah I'm yet for people who don't know I think pretty much everyone who's watched our videos so far knows that we've got quite a kind of yeah we've got to risk a lot of respect for the integral lens yes there's a kind of developmental model of consciousness and yeah so we do where this has always been this was something that had a huge influence on us reading Trump in the post truth world after the election of Trump was Ken Wilbur's ebook and yeah we have something coming up next week it was next week isn't it yeah yeah we had a discussion with Jeff Salzmann of The Daily Evolver that some time ago now but we were gonna put it out next week with the series Jordan Pederson on the left as a as a kind of integral take on Jordan Pederson yeah so yeah we were definitely gonna do more of that and number 12 number 12 from Alavi I've read some comments about the men's getaway that rebel wisdom runs and they characterize it in rebel wisdom as a brand of feminism is that a fair thing to say and how do those counts relate to the current dichotomy of gender politics feminism the third wave and the second wave based liberal feminism and then in brackets hot summer and Paglia and men's rights activism and Peter stone Ian men's advocacy and then in brackets Peterson rejecting feminism and outlining the poor state of masculinity and manhood and a way forward for men so his rebel wisdom a brand of feminism that's though that's the key question there was someone who commented on most of our early videos saying watch out men these are crypto radical feminists fairplay term he was very persistent he was very persistent yeah and it's really interesting we've actually just come back from America we've got a whole load of content we're gonna be putting out around masculinity fairly soon we spoke to Warren Farrell who is kind of known as the godfather of the the the men's movement well the men's rights movement although I think that's slightly unfair because I don't really he's synonymous with the men's rights movement he's he's a he's a therapist and a deep thinker and someone who was part of the the feminist movement itself in the 70s and then broke with them over certain ideological difficulties he had with whip with feminism as it was developing but it's interesting we asked him about this question he saying look we a lot what seems to trigger this guy in particular and summer some other men is any tell or any talk about Maine getting in touch with their emotions triggers them immediately into that's women's talk that's feminism it's like I find it entirely bizarre I find that whole perspective really bizarre yeah the idea it just seems incredibly you know just seems incredibly narrow their definition of what masculinity is I I would not yeah I our work is not only our work is about emotional health like saying things that you because that's coverage it's also parity I'll talk about what's really good so I see that as a as a as a masculine trait just as much as it's a kind of emotional intelligence feminine trait but also that's not that's not all that our workshops are about as well yeah it's also about a really deep sense of connector to the masculine energy the masculine Drive the life force making friends with our anger using that as fuel and our lives integrating so I certainly not a this is a difficult question when someone says are you a feminist because it's usually a barb it's usually a hook yeah because there's no right answer to that and to remain in polite society yeah because you have to give the same art to the Jordan Pederson would give which is if you're saying wouldn't it be great for men and women to be able to offer their skills from from from an equal basis absolutely anything less is it's crazy yeah if it's the idea that the world is a corrupt patriarchy and men need to atone for that and no that's ideology and that's not something that I'm into yeah yeah likewise just on that point I have a very similar feeling around that question I've never described myself as a feminist but then again of course of course I want equality of opportunity and I think it's important to strive for that but as the ideology and as the conspiracy theory no and as thick the the way it's turned into kind of castration and shaming of the masculine actually find that like I'm really really not okay with that and I find that a lot of the men you comfort of workshops as well have internalized that to the degree to a large degree often all of us have to some extent and part of the work we do is it's going through that and coming out and it kind of grounded in body confident and relaxed masculinity yeah honestly that those comments early pissed me off from that guy and it's interesting that it's come up you know that's someone's read them because yeah for a similar reason to what you you laid out it's this I can understand and would agree with like that the nice guy thing of men being like really overly vulnerable all the time to kind of score points or because that's like oh that's it thank you that's the way to have sex with girls that also probably doesn't I'm sure worked a couple of times for them but like that is really not yeah I'm not about that at all but being being in touch with your emotions is absolutely essential and it's what the this kind of reaction against that from from a few people for me that's that's boy a boyish victimhood mmm it's not it's not for me I look at that I don't think it's manly I don't know what should black mic for I don't know any women who would look at that and find that sexy or empowering or strong it would just be like there's something unresolved there yeah yeah and aporia now we forgot to we forgot to set a clock before we started doing this so we yeah yeah it's wanted to conclude that by saying we've we've actually renamed our weekend workshop a new masculinity yeah so we are I think what we're offering is where we're placing it is within an evolutionary framework of responding to the to the the rise of feminism but not from a and I find too much of the root of the men's rights activist movement is in reactivity to that feminism like it's it's saying well these angry women in feminism but it's it's got a real Lang it's got a real wreck reactivity to it and a real anger of its own and it can easily just become another victim story yeah like women women did this to me yeah rather than an empowering taking responsibility for ourselves on a narrative and so that that is how we're framing it we're framing it as as offering and I think that has to be in a space of personal growth that has to be a space of sort of really embodying our masculinity and because because also what we're then fighting against this kind of gender neutrality of well there is no such thing as masculinity and femininity it's all gender neutral and we sort of plant a flag and say no that's not true yeah and your deep embodied reality is as a man in my experience for myself certainly most of the men that we've had in our workshops there is something tangible as a we can tap into the is it is it is something that when we ground ourselves in that we find our relationships with women improve yeah and other men and but everyone pretty much more present and more authentic which creates trust in men or women yeah yeah great and then so there were a lot of amazing questions and we've done 12 I think there were 100 comments so yeah thank you everybody and on that note a couple people asked quite rightly like whether there can be some kind of chat or some way for us to continue this conversation all together in some forum and there is now because we have created a discord and in the show notes for this will be the link so click it if you want to join or our hope is to create quite a thriving community where we can bounce ideas back and forth where we can yeah explore the content we're putting up suggest new content just debate get to know one another yeah and I'm personally really looking forward to that to be cool and I hope you'll join us great thank you you
