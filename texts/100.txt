this is the first rebel wisdom podcast and we're basically my name's David fuller I'm Alexander Boehner and together we are rebel wisdom and I assume that most people who watch this will be subscribers and they'll have seen some of the stuff that we've been putting out the Jordan Peters and stuff and whatever so the idea is to give a little bit of background about what the rebel wisdom project is where we're going and yeah what the kind of what the thought behind it is so even though this is addressed at you I'm gonna keep looking at hell even though that's a real even that Ali knows everything like Italian so my background I used to work for Channel four News I've been a journalist for about 15 years left started doing documentaries and during that time I've also done a lot of I studied philosophy at University and have always been interested in big ideas and also personal growth work lots of shadow work lots of which is the stuff that really kind of drew me to Jordan Peterson a couple of years ago a year or so ago and all through that time I've also been kind of thinking about how to get some of these more interesting slightly esoteric subjects onto mainstream media and realizing it's very difficult to get these in because there's there's there's gatekeepers there's a huge resistance especially to stuff that sort of is in you might call spiritual or religious or there's a kind of materialist skepticism and I think that is a real yes it's a real barrier and through rebel wisdom aim is to bring a deeper sense of yeah just a much deeper conversation than the one that we're really seeing in the mainstream media at the moment which sort of ties into the whole intellectual dark web thing and a lot of the films and stuff that we've done and stuff we are going to cover so what you tell me about your background stuff yes stuff you don't know yes so I'm a writer and I'm also quite involved in the psychedelic community so I help organize a conference that happens every two years called breaking convention about a thousand really interesting mix of neuroscientists all the way to really hardcore hippies kind of all coming together to discuss psychedelic research and culture and also for the last five or six years I've been teaching non-religious meditation through an organization I set up in London so far we've put out I'd know 1015 bits of content on the rebel wisdom YouTube channel we've got a medium channel we're putting out some blogs and so far one writer Andrew Sweeney he's been doing some really good stuff for us and so far I think we've done I mean I we did pretty well with the Jordan Peterson stuff I mean I remember discovering Jordan Peterson last June and just immediately thinking this is the thing that is needed right now this is about the reinterment of the world the assimilation of spirituality the assimilation of religion this is this is the thing and I was kind of obsessed like digesting listening to all of his stuff and then pitched an interview to him and was lucky enough to get an interview with him in October that we then put out as the truth in the time of chaos documentary in in January at exactly the time that ironically he then kind of shot to fame with an interview with my ex colleague Kathy Newman on Channel 4 News when a lot of what I had gone to talk to Jordan Peterson about was synchronicity and it was just uncanny that's when the synchronicity stopped that's right that's right that's when things start to line up yeah and the more you're in that space the more they line up yeah and so the question is if you're like really in that space how much do things line up all of this was happening and I I wondered what I was gonna make what to make of this and for quite a while I was thinking well I have this kind of link to to Kathy and I have some kind of link to Jordan so what I need to do is the am and get them to go and do the second interview that I thought was necessary and so for a while I was doing that kind of trying to do stuff behind the scenes and then it was clear that Cathy wasn't interested Channel four weren't interested so Channel four News sorry weren't interested so in the end I thought well I came and then it came to me okay I should make a documentary glitching the matrix which then was a way of like just downloading all the stuff that I've been thinking about for quite a while and especially since the election of Trump about kind of the the shadow side of liberalism and all of the the blind spots of liberalism so glitching the matrix was kind of a the title of it and it all it was it came from a very from a real flow state of like being really a line and feeling like okay this is what I meant to be doing which is the essence of kind of synchronicity and the essence of Jordan Peterson's deeper meaning is you know when you're aligned at the right place and then your sense of meaning tells you what to do so this and I think the impact that it's had so far which has been pretty great like the response has been really great and I'm quite proud of it as a piece of work has shown that it's something that that people really wanted and I met a lot of people at the Jordan Peterson event last night who were saying you came up to me and shook my hand and said wow this is really interesting it really showed me it kind of opened my eyes to a lot of what was going on so I'm quite proud of that and really keen that we keep going so you could say why why the obsession with Jordan Pederson and for me it's it's not really about Jordan Peterson Jordan Pederson is kind of the messenger and is an amazing advocate for something that we've forgotten and that for me is the deep story of Western culture and he is embodying that deep story of Western culture in his performances he's talking about aligning yourself with the truth the logos and I think he's often misconstrued by people who can't get past the politics or have a reactivity to him but to me he is doing nothing less than channeling and fully articulating the deep story of Western culture for the first and well certainly for the first time in the Internet age you could argue that Young was doing the same thing back in the in the 50s and that there are people who come along and do this at times in the past but effectively saying we already know a lot of the answers we already know the way to live it's embodied interaction that's embodied in mythologies embodied in our religions it's embodied and all of these things look at this piece of art what is it saying we represented it in art we represented it in all these ways and now we can fully articulate it tie into neuroscience tie into and that it's a it's an epic epic project and so I get accused and it's very easy to say well you're obsessed with Jordan Peterson you're a fanboy and all that stuff and but for me the message that he's bringing forward is that deep it's that deep and therefore I want to continue to use his thought as a lens to link into other great thinkers like we just put out an interview with Rupert Sheldrake who I think is an amazing rebellious thinker he's been doing this stuff for a long time and I want to also continue to kind of expand that into other into other thinkers make the conscious link to to this sort of deeper worldview and help yeah just bring out great bring out great content really what do you make of Jordan Peterson it took you a little bit longer maybe to get into it yeah it did I mean I'm thinking back to to like maybe this time last year and I think one of the first things we started talking about was Wilbur's Trump and a post truth world so Ken Wilber yeah Ken Wilber who kind of yeah was the driving force or is behind integral studies which is to cut a long story short and we are gonna be releasing a lot of interviews with integral thinkers coming up so but this idea of trying to see reality as fully as possible and it's really it's a really deep model it was one of the first things that really got me into wanting to integrate my shadow and really see the importance of that and seeing we're the Eastern traditions couldn't comment on the Western traditions and vice versa and quite a big model so after Trump was elected he wrote a great piece where he pointed out that part of the part of the reason if not the reason is because the leading edge of culture had been what in their model they defined as green which is the kind of pluralistic relative progressive you you could say and that it can become kind of the leading edge of our arts and our assumptions and kind of a leading edge of culture however to cut a long story short it's not nearly as inclusive as it thinks it is so it's got a shadow it doesn't want to look at its own and a performative contradictions yes so Green basically is inclusivity it's what fuels civil rights it's what fuels so the wave of kind of equality of the 60s and 70s but then it became corrupt yeah because it didn't realize it was a tribalism yeah and that's a really key thing with it is that it's a really important stage of development so that so all of integral Studies is really based around not throwing out the baby with the bathwater it's a real it's a model that says yes and just like when you become nine years old you don't kill your five-year-old self you grow and you and your five year old self is you know your experiences are all there they're recontextualized so yeah that was exactly it is that Green has become toxic effectively and you know to almost a very tribal degree of you know will be inclusive as long as you're as inclusive as us otherwise you are a deplorable so it's really what Hillary Clinton said so that really was a one of the most interesting things I read and resonated with me the most and then it took me a while to get into Jordan Peterson you know I was interested but it just took well it takes a while to really get to watch enough of this stuff because it's complex it's not an easy it's not an easily understood thing it takes time to really wrestle with and get into yeah and then then I think there's two things with him that I think are really important that I really see is that a he's very hard to categorize and he is part of if not the main driving force now in getting green to look at his own shadow you know and he's bringing up some of what integral studies they would call the kind of the the levels before that the traditionalism all of that you know clean your room and really kind of connecting with certainty and that and then that's the key thing it's truth and more than that he's sort of channeling a kind of traditionalist knowledge that has been forgotten by the relativistic and postmodern world basically and that's why we would and we were so thirsty for it and that's where his color of success has come from yeah definitely I think and I think there's this there's a huge power in that but there's a need for it it's it's there's a deep need for it and I've always had a problem with post-modernism ever since I would I studied English universe I studied English in University and a postmodern writing is is really bad you know because it doesn't follow the mythic journey you know doesn't follow the mono myth it kind of subvert and it can be interesting it's kind of an intellectual masturbation but in general I thought this is smoke and mirrors you know this is not tapping into the depths of the psyche and everyone knows everyone when you read a story whether you're five years old or whether you're 90 years old it resonates with you because but that's Joseph Campbell's insight into the mono myth it's because the story isn't about what you're reading it's about your own inner personal journey which is shared collectively it's about the process of an individual going from a state of a lower level of awareness to a state of more awareness so you know frodo starts in the Shire and he's a bit of a wimp and he you know he likes to stay home then he gets a call to adventure then it goes in a journey and when he returned you know he encounters his own darkness you know Luke Skywalker's the perfect example when he's with Yoda he encounters Darth Vader or a vision of him it cuts off his head with a lightsaber and it's his own face behind the mask you know it's it's about as symbolic as it gets so all of the stories that we really really like to watch follow a mythic journey and post-modernism through literature often doesn't or subvert it in some way and you know it's all about kind of playing with it which is fine you know that's a literary thing but when when the values of that are applied to how people actually live their lives it's insane it's it's what can we work all day it creates narcissism but it also creates what he called a perspectival madness because it everything is relative and there's no truth and there's no certainty you you go mad we're human beings we we need it and we'll finally so that becomes a certainty the eighth pursuit of a prospective or madness as well is I'm certain there's no truth like oh so that's the truth is it it's I've always been yeah that's always being an argument I feel that has come up again and again and again and again like when I'm talking to someone it's like yeah well there is no truth it's like though but hang on yeah and it becomes kind of completely yo just disappear down the rabbit hole yeah the other it's interesting as well the the reactivity to Peterson because the other thing about integral theory that's really good and I think is also informing a lot of what we're interested in and doing is the idea of yes end so integral theory is always yes and so it's it's a process of integrating and moving beyond and integrating and moving beyond and I do think that there is almost certainly a deeper resolution than Dan Peterson by Peterson is bringing forward something something timeless and eternal and something that has to be integrated before we move forward but I think there is a part that we can move forward and I think Peterson himself is actually trying to do that I mean you get a sense when he's talking on stage he's thinking and he's genuinely trying to work out where he's wrong where he can get better and more and and and I think he's he's probably now that he's kind of reached a level ii he's reached is having conversations with other thinkers on a similar level to him that are going to probably develop his thought even further and I would say the only level I often challenged by people is like where you know you're never critical at Peterson like well that's because most of the criticisms are nonsense and they show more about you than they do about him like their reactivity but I think the one criticism I think is valid is one that he's now a thinker on the world stage he's not he's not in student politics anymore and I think there's a certain reactivity to to student politics that that I think comes across as a sort of an anger and a peevishness and a kind of reactivity that puts some people off and also I challenge him a little bit on he says that ideas have people people don't have ideas so I'd like to see him so why not have compassion for people who have who've been kind of taken in by this new Marxist ideology or this relativistic ideology it's in in some sense you can have a lot of anger towards their kind of professors and whatever and but actually if if he was I think part of the reason this is the other paradox of Peterson he's like his message is about transcending division talking to people you don't agree with him coming like and yet he is one of the most divisive characters in society and I think part of that is this kind of intense reactivity to him by the dominant culture this kind of neo Marxism this kind of green thinking that can't integrate what he's saying because it can't deal with the idea of hierarchy it can't deal with the idea of truth it can't deal with all these things and that's part of it for sure that's a huge part of it but I think there is some part where he is still in a kind of angry reactivity to probably what happened to him and probably kind of that his job was at risk for like eight months and and he was under it and he is still under attack completely unfairly on a regular basis but there is I wonder if part of it is this sort of anger and reactivity that a lot of people sense in him that actually means that they have a reactivity to listening to what he's saying and and I think I think that's the only not maybe not the only but that's the main thing that I think his critics have a point on although I also think that he has he uses anger and and in a really useful way as well and I think a lot of people don't recognize that like you see him revving himself up and stay that part of his performative aspect he's really aligned himself he's he uses anger as a tool like he's a he's he's integrated in Wilbur terms and he's integrated his red like red the kind of anger shadow tribalism you all right like he's integrated that in a way that very few people in our culture have and it's often sort of shamed and rejected and lots of people have a problem with anger so when they see him in that kind of but anger if it's integrated as he talks about like the Jungian shadow it becomes force it becomes power it becomes all of the stuff in the world so I think there's a reactivity as well on the other side so it's a complete it's a really complex picture is really complex yeah and I think there is AI know I think that is a valid criticism that I've read for many of the reasons describing where it's you know could he be saying yes and a bit more with the postmodern side of it because there are benefits there are good things and it's good we went through a civil rights but and all those things they're positives so how would you some of the good things about green I would say the good things about green are that so I would copy anything this postmodern kind of like everything as a stage to develop as a stage of development is that it takes you out of the rigidity of the previous stages so it allows you to start playing yeah playing with identity playing that the way things are done playing with power dynamics and that playing creates growth and it's an important stage you know because we free ourselves from restrictive social situations from restrictive laws from restrictive ways of seeing things you know I've got and getting different perspectives from different is a big part of it is getting the the perspective of the underdog of the person who's oppressed you know which they've taken to absurd levels but as a concept it's important to get many voices but you also need to have a so Francois Lyotard said that who's one of the kind of fathers of post-modernism or what would become post-modernism this is very postmodern it's like oh there's no such thing as post-modernism but he said without the sublime which is this I this is the point at which language fails it's the point at which the you kind of encounter the transcendent and you cannot describe it is it kind of the ineffable so without the sublime this whole thing is doomed to madness because you have to with all that playing this whole relativity you like with all of that playing that you're doing you've got to have an anchor you've got to have an anchor then it's safe then it reminds me actually then it's very psychedelic it's a you know in the psychedelic experience it's a very deconstructed experience extremely so and when you have a bad trip it's when you forget that you're tripping and you forget that you're present you lose your ground of being you lose your presence and you get swept up in the the chaos that's why they always you always tell people in a psychedelic emergency this will end it contextualizes that you are having a drug experience you are having this experience and it's going to end so that kind of madness can can infect the whole society as well in addition to the films and stuff we're putting out we're also doing events because I mean the reason I really wanted to see Peterson and a lot of my questions were about integration of the shadow because what I've done a lot of shadow work a lot of integration work we're sort of working with your anger working integrating all the negative parts of yourself the the Jungian idea of all the parts we repress and deny and integrating them to become most of the present in the world and powerful and I found my life being transformed as I've done that kind of work like being yeah things have started to sort of come together and I found it really powerful and hearing him talk about it just overlaid everything I'd ever learned the hard way like he was describing the process that I've been through he was describing all of the integration stuff so I was like wow this the first thinker I've found to describe this process in detail and get it exactly right so also therefore the focus on this message of kind of integration also demands for me like real-world events but we have to do the work it's not enough just to talk about it and it's it's invaluable to talk about it and to do it and to kind of to bring this knowledge out to as many people as possible but actually to get people give people the possibility of doing the work themselves is the essential part of and therefore and this was happening in parallel we like both of us have done quite a lot this kind of work and we're being mentored by a guy who's done this work for about 40 years and where we've been learning to lead groups ourselves or little facilitate workshops where people can come and just have a weekend or a certain time to just look at what's at their shadow look at what's really working in their lives look at what's holding them back and identifying that part of themselves that wants it to change and can make it change and then yeah and transforming or getting a taste of what it might be like to move past whatever these blockages are in their lives and and what's fascinating as well is that this has really mapped onto the Jordan Pederson work like it's before a lot of this work is sort of often done in a sort of cuts like a New Age hippie kind of vibe of vulnerability and sharing a truth and all this other stuff and what Peterson does is reframes in a much more solid way of you are coming here to align yourself with your deeper truth you're coming to align yourself with the logos you are coming to integrate your shadow and you're coming to become more fully present to yourself and this is the deeper story of Western culture and that for me is is an incredibly powerful reframing of the kind of work we've been doing for quite a long time absolutely yeah and it it really speaks to the you know he talks about this difference between rights and responsibilities you know a law and men really connect with that we you know I certainly do and the ultimate person responsibility is is over your own your own inner house over your own being you know it's that you do the work and you show up as we say a lot you know you have to show up tell the truth you know be honest with yourself be honest with someone else which is even more challenging I would say but more rewarding and also be be brave enough to go into the places you don't want to look at you know if that responsibly because no one else can do that for you so all you can really do in a workshop is really hold the space and guide that process to happen but it's it's every man I'm talking specific about the men's work that we're doing because we there is women's work as well but we don't run it so you know and we connect deeply with men's work it's that kind of personal responsibility and then the support of one another which is astonishing you know it always amazes me yeah I mean we started again I think we started this before even I discovered you know we started this before you can discovering Jordan Peterson which is another kind of uncanny synchronicity that it overlaid on to this as we started teaching men's work and because this is where I we see the greatest need right now it's like this is men as Peterson talks about are in some sense more lost by this idea of rights against responsibilities men have to carry a load men have to be directed men have to have to take on responsibility without responsibility we're kind of lost and I guess I kind of knew that before and I also really recognized in my own life as I started working on my masculinity and working on it with other men there's something that we're missing a lot this idea of vitamin M that something of being around with other men and talking truthfully with them and really kind of looking at ourselves really owning our stuff is feeding something like really deep in us like I think and and seeing who we are and seeing who we are in these spaces like we would have kind of worked together on a common project it's like a common project we can find and do together and this really feeds my soul to be of all the things that we're doing like I know all the success that we've had so far with the films and stuff what really feeds my soul is the workshops and being there and hearing guys say wow I never never felt this sense of brotherhood before I've never I've realized stuff about myself and had a and a life-changing experience and this is what's extraordinary we did the workshop in in April and cuz a lot of the guys have come through the Jordan Peterson documentaries there was a they knew the shadow they knew the idea of aligning oneself with the truth they were ready to go and they really went deep and it was just or inspiring to behold and really feels like we're on the verge of something if we can keep building this and people will keep coming to the workshop I think we're on the verge of but this this for me is the cutting edge of where we need to go as a culture to re-embrace I think what we've what we've confused is the idea of we do need to integrate both masculine and feminine qualities within ourselves but the way to do that is by really connecting with our four men with our masculinity and then we can connect with sort of more feminine side what Jung called the master work is integrating the Animas of the female part of ourselves and that comes through through really connecting to our masculine it gives us the grounding to then be able to integrate the feminine and also to be able to like meeting women for a much more grounded place so the coming young me in terms the inner and outer feminine but you get a much like women can feel that they can trust you far more when you're really connected to your masculine you're not you're not ashamed of it you're not kind of sneaking around trying to it's it's a very different quality of presence that you bring yeah absolutely with with women and men you know and presence is such an important word because true presence were you really connected to yourself implies that you are aligning yourself properly because I you know having taught meditation for years one thing I've noticed is that there's something you know when we're not present it's because we don't want to be we don't really want to be with ourselves in that moment you know so when you come into being like Who am I like what am i bringing what am I feeling what do I need to go through that's that's the Warriors process it really is it's a process of a kind of inner it's a deep inner process that requires courage and like you were saying you know when it's happening and on the workshops you know I've sat in many psychedelic ceremonies and many meditation retreats and some amazing group work and there is just something that happens in that space with just men that you know we call it vitamin M because it needs some kind of a afraid's because it's very hard to describe in language it's a feeling you know it's a feeling in the air and it's one of groundedness and it's one of support and also for me I feel a huge amount of relief in the whole space of like oh it's okay to be a man okay and when you come into that place you're a much wiser more you know integrated honest man and you know when men come back to you know their partners afterwards generally their partners see that first off it's that kind of you know their feeling in it and that you know they often have good sex and why here's well yeah so yeah it feels yeah it feels like that's where we have to go as a culture to me that this reom bracing of polarity and then consciously so it's like a paradox I think we've got this sort of idea like the even the Greeks talked about like this this spiritual state of the hero's gamos the idea is the inner marriage of the masculine or feminine within oneself as the higher spiritual truth and there and I think perhaps we have some echo of that because in our culture it's like well then gender neutrality is is the way to go it's like no no gender neutrality is not the way to go the way to go is full conscious embodiment of the masculine for men full conscious embodiment of the feminine for women and then we can integrate our own in a masculine as a woman and in a feminine as a man and and then that's the that's the place that we need to go and that I think is so it's a paradox as most things are a paradox as I also think that the paradox of individuality and connection is that only by truly individuating only by truly going deeply into ourselves and going through our stuff can we reach this point where we can really meet other people and we can feel that in some sense this sort of spiritual truth that we are all the same person looking at each other in some sense like we are consciousness discovering itself or this sort of all the hippie but the paradox is we can only get there through the deep work on ourselves individually and this is something in our workshops we talk about and it's came to us during the last workshop it's like we have to do it ourselves but we don't have to do it alone which i think is a perfect summation and that's what we yeah that's what we really want to give people a sense of in the workshops absolutely and and it's I think it's core to everything we're doing a tribal wisdom because you do need both you need an intellectual framework and now you know that's why we're going out to find the most rebellious thinkers and that's you know why Jordan Peterson is so important to this as well because that you get this framework which we didn't have well you know we did but you know it's much more popular now you know when Jung was writing his books people couldn't go on YouTube and you know look at ours of them now people can which is incredible so you need that but you must also embody it if you wanted to really change your life I think that's the thing it's got to be lived like it's embody means it's in your body you're walking around with it you're feeling it it means you're taking responsibility for who you are all the time and you're taking that seriously so combining the two is is the ideal rebellious wisdom rebellious ism
