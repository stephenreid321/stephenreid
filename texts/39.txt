[Music] you had a really interesting wonderful conversation with jordan peterson earlier this year and a lot of people like the read the comments and a lot of people thought it was one of his best conversations seem that you really sparked off each other and yes i enjoyed it yeah yeah can you talk more about that he came from the now-famous interview with Kathy Newman on channel 4 so he was quite you know wired he arrived extremely late and he had half an hour between them and getting to Paris we had had we'd never met one another and I knew actually very little about Jordan Peterson has written work he knew pretty little about mine and we were just told sit down and shoot and we had no idea where we were going so he just started talking so why the maestro's emissary and he just went from there but what I felt was here was you know a super intelligent man who had wide-ranging interests in psychology philosophy and didn't rule out a spiritual angle to things and I don't think that I would and in the film I in that clip I think he probably comes out that there are aspects of what Jordan was saying that I was getting well yes but so I didn't entirely kind of not a Peter Peter Sohn Ian but I do have a huge respect for him and we had a great conversation and we were proposing to do more yeah I mean one of the most common comments was where's the rest of this interview well actually I just he's been fabulously busy in the last year and I had to email him about something else actually just yesterday and he wrote back saying and top of my list for when I begin again doing a podcast in the new year is to do one with you listening to it that was very interesting especially as you hadn't you weren't that aware of each other's work how it seemed that your theories mapped onto something he talks about a lot which is the balance of ordering chaos and the known versus the unknown is that a right-brain left-brain for no is there a parallel not much there is a bit I mean Festival I'm sorry I don't accept his order is mail than chaos is female I don't even understand that and I do accept that the left hemisphere which is nor what he's talking about is concerned above all with consistency so and that's why it over relies on systems procedures algorithms that produce results are consistent with everything else it knows the right hemisphere is open to everything as you were without prejudice and it therefore sees that there are many things that actually don't then do that now in the left hemisphere those just get ruled out and I think that's where we wraps intellectually we have a system that is self-consistent a cake flan getting rolled out and everybody can't see well not everybody but many people cannot see a way out of this because because actually once you're inside this hall of mirrors as I call it you can't see the chinks where you can sort of get out what I think Jordan Peterson is doing is he has enormous rhetorical strength and he's really you know allowing people to to see that there are things that is not that are not included this model and I'm hoping that I enter perhaps in a different way I'm doing the same thing if you like I did say to him you've seemed very keen on order which might exclude chaos but chaos is like the sort of grit in the oyster shell there is a need for this resistance this is a theme that is very important in the book I'm now writing which is that nothing comes into being or can be without resistance and some simple way of thinking about it is that actually we can't move if it were not for friction friction is actually stopping you moving actually moving dependence on friction a more sophisticated one is to do with the nature of flow which is the overarching merciful' of flow as what it is what the universe is you know Heraclitus is saying everything flows this is brilliant you didn't say everything changes he said everything flows which is a different matter but anyway flow produces something very important it produces irregularities and it only actually exists if there is a degree of containment so if water if if there is no containment water is still and does nothing it's the containment that causes the flow and it's obstructions to the flow that caused turbulence and turbulence is massively created or flow in nature is turbulent or at least almost all that flowing in nature is turbulent and turbulence is one of the last things that we can map we know how we we're getting to grip we don't really know but we're getting to grips better with quantum mechanics than we are with the the mathematical equations for flow they're so complex and this they're almost infinitely complex that it is said that we can never actually do it so they might be an instance of a kind of chaos that is vastly created partly because it's the coming together of order with disorder and I'm always saying we need division and we need Union it's not just that union is marvelous all as one and that's the perfectly why's point of view it's not that everything is separate and distinct and atomistic we need to bring these two apparently opposite points of view together we need Union and division but we need at a meta level the union of them not the division of them which is what we now have so that is imaged in this business of water and let me just give you a something that might strike viewers if you take an entirely straight sided pipe and you put waters run water through it at such a speed that it can run smoothly and you then place at right angles perpendicular to the flow an entirely straight metal bar that doesn't block the flow what you get what do you think you get you get something imaginable that is both orderly and beautiful and nothing like the rector linearity of it you get something called Carmen Street vortex which is a series of interlocking flows that have clear structure that are also unwrapped Abul and and endlessly variable so out of this unpromising conjunction a rectilinear unitary things comes this multifarious creative beauty that is I think it a lovely image for me so I remember in the interview you asked you asked that question about that he was a little bit more suspicious of Kaos than the newer and his answer was that he thought it was right to put yourself on the right border between order and chaos yes which is where we came together yes and he acknowledged that there needs to be this this coming together of order and chaos so I don't think we're apart on this it was just the difference of emphasis because whatever else it seemed from what he'd just been saying in the conversation that he I mean after all famously he said get your room in order which I'm in favor of I'm also in favor of a slight element of disorder in the order and indeed the the art of beauty is a uniting water with disorder pattern with things that can't be mapped and what do you make of the sort of the criticisms cuz often he's described as a fraud or a charlatan in some of the the media coverage but when you watch the interview with yourself I mean that's that's a very high level conversation the idea of him as a a charlatan just seems kind of bizarre it's it's outrageous it's it's disrespectful its dismissive and it's entirely typical of blinkered liberalism he you can disagree with him about many things and I would disagree with him about a number of things but to say that is just to show how pink and you are he's clearly an extraordinary man and I mean I think what strikes people is that he was relatively unknown and then he became known but that's what life isn't it disapproval Rochelle's yeah maybe some jealousy but I mean what what's interesting for me is someone who I went out to interview him in October last year and as soon as yeah before well before the Kathy Newman interview yeah and my immediate as soon as I saw a couple of his lectures I thought this is of this is the important piece that we're missing in our culture right now so none of like his his his meteoric success since then has been no surprise to me because I thought it's not to me and also I find it very interesting that in this very new atheist kind of dominated world yeah something we have a man talking about religious experience and spiritual experience one of the most famous academics in the world how significant do you think that as I think it is very significant I myself probably prefer more you might call it mystical approach to religion then then Jordan and although I wouldn't want to you know narrow down I don't know him and his views well enough to but I sensed that I the things that really interest me in the spiritual tradition Taoism Zen Sufism the medieval mystics meister eckhart the author of the Cloud of Unknowing you know Jakob Irma Udo that score and these people seem to me to be expressing very profound truths and indeed in that talk with Jordan I brought up the lurianic kabbalah which is something I came to only about four or five years ago but which is seems to me absolutely packed with with the most vivid insights in into the nature of things which which illuminates um the the right left hemisphere thing that I've been talking about I just couldn't believe it that it there it was in 1600 and something people insures it this you see this is the thing I think people have an intuitive knowledge that them their mind is actually not unitary that there are different aspects to it that have differently valid ways of thinking but that the culture forces you to response one point of view one of the values of having a religious culture is that it allows you to espouse what first of all it instills humility which is no bad thing it seems to me simply a failure of intellect to believe your intellect is so powerful that it knows everything or even could and so no doubt in evolution is an ongoing process we let I mean a mouse by thinking those everything but whatever it comes after us may look back on us and think with their poor little brains so the Harrigan's of we can understand it all is breathtaking so one thing good thing about religion is it instills a sense of you know limits and humility which I think are very good it embodies I mean this is old old hat but it embodies certain kinds of moral principle which of course it's not necessary to an atheist can be a very moral person but it's actually quite useful in the culture to have norms against which to judge things at the moment the norms those of me and what I need and so on which are not so good is we should simply trade it down you refer to it just then about the the idea of the left brain as a Hall of Mirrors yes and I think this is in your RSA animation as well the idea that the things I think I paraphrase but something like the things that might lead us out yeah are immediately seized upon I think what you're talking about is any kind of experience beyond the left brain is immediately seized upon by the left brain and brought back into could could you describe that because I also sounds a lot like the definition of post-modernism which is that it is that it takes the surface and strips out the meaning and then you're back years even the transcendental is then taken and deconstructed and you're absolutely right and the there are good things in post-modernism but there are also problems with it when it claims that because truth is complex evolving difficult to pin down there is no truth I mean once we're in that realm you know you can't even have a conversation because it depends on some kinds of truth I couldn't get out of bed without it so that's my problem with it although you know one of the things I disagree with about Jordan does he dismisses the whole thing of face model is where there's rather valuable strands do however you your question was not really about post-modernism per se it was about this Hall of Mirrors and I think that what happens is the left hemisphere is quite good on indignant it and that might sound like you you're being very metaphorical but but I you know I have nothing a good metal fist they all have you understand things but it's also literally true neuropsychiatric lee the people who have right hemisphere damage in such colossal denial sometimes that it beggars belief you know and you know I've talked about this before good perhaps I'll just say it again because it's an illustration that that brings it home somebody can have a completely paralyzed part of their body that the left arm after a right hemisphere is straight and they will absolutely deny there's anything wrong with it and when asked to move it they will go there without moving it and they they're convinced and if you bring it round in front of them and say now don't move that they will say oh that's not my arm that belongs to the bloke in so it's that bad and people you know with right hemisphere now if they have no clue of what it is that's wrong with them so they get very angry and challenged when people say actually there's a problem here irritability and anger are very strong in the left hemisphere and I think that that I think what I was getting at in the Hall of Mirrors is several things really I mean one is the the self referential nature of the structure of the systemic thinking which is not open to new information but also that the the things that used to speak to us about something beyond if you like to say our normal everyday idea about the world where the natural world art religion cultural wisdom handed down from generation to generation spirituality these things and that each of them we've either become alienated from in some way were the ones that we haven't have been ionized and mocked and dismissed and a point I make in the book is incidental but in de it is interesting the the left hemisphere never subtle tends to piss on things it doesn't understand and when the Communists revolution happened in Russia the churches were actually she sounded public lavatories in some cases and then of course you've got Marcel Duchamp literally turning art into the paper I know and you've got in the 20th century loads and loads of people whose artwork was feces so there's something incredibly unsubtle imaginatively but it's really like a gesture you and that is the level of converse one can have with the left hemisphere and sometimes I feel that it's the level of Congress that one can have with not the brighter ones but the less bright New Atheists the internet is full of atheistic trolls scientistic believers that they know it all and everything else is rubbish and this is very sad you spoke before about it was interesting when you mentioned Taoism because that was sort of implicit in a lot of what you were saying before when you were talking about the union of opposites and how the the idea in Taoism is that things that seem like they're opposites are actually two parts of a composite whole and I think in the Jordan Pederson in 2b you also talked about how that's the Hegelian perspective as well that there is a greater synthesis that that incorporates two things that are seen as and can you talk a bit about Taoism and how that maps onto what your to your yes your view your work I'm not the only person to have read in their early twenties Alan Watts his doubt of the watercourse way and that was an eye-opening experience for me because again I thought oh gosh the this resonates enormously was my experience of the world and yet it's not what I was taught at at school and actually left you know it's interesting that and that the contemporary view by a reduction this is that and you wouldn't believe any of these weird thinking us if they if you hadn't been indoctrinated in them but in fact my indoctrination was very much in the rationalist tradition but I left school believing certain things that since then I found arguments and sophisticated philosophers and evidence in science that they may well be true but I couldn't have known that at that stage and they were that the parts are not the same as the whole the sum of the parts simply is not whatever you say the same as the whole if you say well what is that what is this mystery thing that's been added in but that's of course because you're already starting from the wrong point of view so the fact of the relationship of parts for how the idea that the world is a responsive thing that experience responds to you and you respond to it it's not a one-way process you know many others of these things that the embodiment of ideas is as important as you know the context changes of them that making things implicit suddenly changes it into something else so all those ideas I intuitively espoused and then I came across Taoism which says things like the Dow that can be named is not in fact that's the start of the data chain the the Dow that can be named is not the real Dow which is how exactly what I had been in queue thing that once you've pinned it down and named it there's no longer the same thing and actually that is also there in the Christian tradition for example central Gaston said if you understand it is not God you understand so all of that spoke to me but also what spoke to me was this idea of flow and movement which I had come across because Eric lysis was legitimate in Heraclitus who I still think is probably the most important philosopher who ever lived even though we only have fragments of what he thought but his thoughts are so resonant and so penetrating that I keep coming back to them so the idea of flow of that's in the watercourse way that's in the now is also in the site of Heraclitus it's also there in Chinese and Japanese poetry that things are like a river on which whirlpools and vortices appear and then disappear into the flow and image I like very much which the German philosopher shelling took up which is that it's a good image for me of how we relate to the stream of life as a whole that for a while there are worlds or vortices caused by resistance and they are there and they're photographed although they're measurable they are material but they are not separate from the flow of the water because they are the flow and they also come out of it and go back into it so there's no need to find a way in which this individual entity is made to care here with the whole so this Minear of the movement of water is you know I can't get into all of it but that that runs through my book and it's a taoist idea it's a Heric like an idea and part of the the sense some of the interviews that we've done have been about the idea that there are thinkers and there are perspectives that have been left out of the sort of mainstream tradition and are really important to recapture I think Taoism Alan Watts is a really good one already but who are the key thinkers that you think are really essential for us to kind of reintegrate into our into our knowledge Western ones yes yes well what stands out for me is William James and only their song the beginning of the century of a song was the most famous philosopher in the world and he's credited with causing the first traffic jam on Broadway because so many people wanted to come in the a.m speak and curiously he's been sidelined since about the thirties and forties he's been recently rediscovered because he said things in the 1870s there's a very recently being confirmed by quantum mechanics and quantum field theory so that is interesting he understood the nature on the importance of time and motion which play a big part in the last part of the book I'm currently working on and that might sound rather limited but actually what he shows you is that a whole different view of what we are what the cosmos is and how we relate to it comes from re-imagining in fact getting in touch once again with the reality of time and the reality of motion I think one of the things we the biggest mistakes we make is to say we'll react that time is just a real oriya fantasy it's just a sort of a delusion and actually when we break out of whatever it is aware now we'll see that time is it's not existent it's quite possible that in a world we cannot even conceive of course then things that we cannot conceive by definition might occur within the through everything we know about the cosmos time is fundamental and cannot be just so and it may sound as I say a rather limited thing but in believe me Bell Tolls philosophy is extraordinarily redolent and I read a few years ago something called creative evolution revolucion Claire trees which is translated now and it is his introduction to metaphysics and a series of other pieces which if people want to approach but some of that is the place to start and it's very rare for me now to read a book and be so electrified that I can't put it down and I'm marking all the way down the page but with this I was so I think he is very important I think William James is so central to much thought that has been left behind again from the same period before a kind of material upsetting in the interwar period there were many steps backwards you know we made huge steps forwards in biology very sophisticated thinkers but between the wars a new mechanism came forth in biology when I started writing about science in this book I thought well physics and to a degree chemistry very much on my side in terms of a philosophy of how things are it's not atomistic is not mechanical etc and then I discovered that actually this is being set down by biologists once again but the last time it was said was really up until the 30s and 40s and then there was a dark age in which everything was likened and and we were very excited by this wonderful discovery about DNA in the you know it's all like code in the computer and so on well I can't even begin we'd have to do another talk about that because I could talk for now about why organisms are not mechanisms it is quite true that if you want to look at a tiny detail like what's going on on this side of a membrane and the other you can see a kind of mechanism in other words a chain of causation but it simply doesn't apply to the organism as a whole it cannot be native not because we don't know enough but intrinsically it is not the right way to think about it and if you doubt that then I would that is one thing I explained early on in the new rule and here I might say there is a very good book called everything flows which is a book of essays by philosophers biologists chemists physicists edited by Duprey and published by a rupee which came out in May this year which is very very interesting [Music] you
