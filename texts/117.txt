people who haven't integrated the shadow at all are naive and you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them and because they're naive they're often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of it and someone who's integrated that more they're dangerous in in the martial arts sort of way which is they're dangerous but they don't have to be they don't have to use it because their presence radiates what would you say it doesn't radiate threat exactly the potential for havoc that's the right way of thinking about it there's a there's an implicit potential for havoc and that's really necessary it's one of the things that gives people self-respect this is an interesting thing about the integration of the shadow because recognizing yourself as the locus of evil let's say actually in some sense gives you far more respect for yourself strangely enough because the same respect that you might have for a wild animal or even a monster you can actually see a change in people's faces when that part of them is integrated when the I would say the rage circuit is integrated because their face is hardened like they no longer look like wide-eyed children that they're no longer someone to whom things only happen there there's someone who makes things happen and there isn't much difference between being dangerous and being indomitable right there.this they're that they're they're the same thing looked at from two different perspectives you you say that you have to accept the fact that you're dangerous as I'd also say that if you haven't done that kind of shadow work if you haven't made friends with your anger if you haven't integrated it you're actually more dangerous yes then things will happen that will it will come out in a way that you don't expect right it comes out disintegrate it so it comes out as an autonomous spirit right under no-one's control and that's like a burst of rage let's say you either have that or it has you those are the options and you don't become safe by being castrated right that's not the right move forward
