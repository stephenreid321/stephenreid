[Music] the intellectual dark web is a name given to a group of alternative media personalities from Joe Rogan to Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson could it also be a spontaneous emergence of a new and more highly evolved level of consciousness into the media landscape that's what the integral philosopher Ken Wilber believes and it's something he's been predicting since the 90s Ken Wilber had serious health problems for the last decade that is now returning to the conversation he believes that the intellectual dark word is the start of a genuinely next level or integral conversation one that lets go of the ideology and fixed thinking of the past and can embrace paradox and nuance see stages apply to an enormous number of different skills and so you can have dozens of different names for these stages and it can get confusing so one of the things we do is just give them different colors so the previous ethnocentric stage we call amber and in this orange rational world centric universal care stage we call orange those two stages amber ethnocentric conventional traditional and then this new orange universal universal rights these started to arise again during the Western enlightenment with the sixties new stage world centric development ended to emerge and that's what we call green or it was multicultural so it wasn't just a belief in individuality and its freedom there's a lot of different opinions about post-modernism on the intellectual dark grip in general nobody likes it my point some things we talked about they said a lot of it really is off-the-wall extreme if you bad have you you want to think about it but they it also had a core of some true if they're partial notions and those truths are initially what actually helped to drive that stage of development and it did start to call itself postmodern because it was reflecting on the previous modern stage of orange liberal rationale Universal care individual liberty freedom freedom of speech it reflected on all of those intended to have sort of a critique of those but it's still having trouble finding ways to actually integrate them and so it tends to take a stance that believes in radical egalitarianism and so it's version of equality is unlike the previous orange version of equality oranges version is liberty and freedom of opportunity for green and it's egalitarianism it wants equal outcome and this becomes enormous lee conflictual is there there too they don't get along well at all for starters and given the fact that the original orange equality actually meant freedom of opportunity oranges version of equality was also often just called freedom it was in favor of the freedom of individuals whereas greens version of equality equal outcome and so it can't just be called equality or equity and so you had freedom and equality and Alex de Tocqueville was one of the first to point out that because human beings are born with different capacities and you can have either freedom or equality but you can't have both and that's exactly right you you could almost frame this as the division between classical liberalism and post-modernism that a lot of people by the intellectual dark Weber really fighting hard on behalf of classical liberalism that's exactly right and one of the things that happen as you go back and look at this original right and left distinction and again there there are several ways that those can be defined but one of the ways that they can be defined does have to do with these stages of development I mean I'm not just agreeing with the other ways Jonathan hight has a particular description of it Jordan Peterson gives at least two definitions of left and right one based on big factor analysis progressives tend to be more open and conservatives tend to be more conscientious particularly suborder a subset subtype order and they also seized a hierarchies of competence as necessary and so the right tends to support those but any sort of hierarchies tend to generate inequality and so the left hates that and tries to tear those down so you need both of those interacting I agree with all of that there's also a factor that you see left and right as you track these stages of development and particularly going from the original amber ethno Center into orange freedom world center into green equality world center and so we started out we had the original traditional right tends to be a snow centric and again it can be a bit racist and a bit sexist and it's not embarrassed about those it's fine with that it thinks that's the way it should be and then you have orange which was the original liberal philosophy of individual rights and rights for all universal individual rights and that really was profound that got rid of slavery that means enormous number of changes that happened with that and then we moved up to the green multicultural which was really toast liberal in many cases became anti-liberal it doesn't really like free speech it doesn't really like individual rights it wants group rights group identity it's very willing to curtail free speech or even on the other hand compel free speech in order to serve social justice ends and that infuriates an enormous number of people on on the dark ribbon and I think rightly rightly so so what started to happen is that as the original left which started this orange individual equal opportunity as I don't know exactly how many of them but I'm gonna say half about half of them as progressive bumped up to the new green starting in the sixties the other half stayed for the original liberal left values but now I had an old left and a new left the right essentially given this new stage that had been added it bumped up a stage two or half of it did so the old original right stated ethnocentric including energy streams white supremacist Nazis fascists but then the other half bounced up to orange and they actually started inhabiting the values of the traditional liberal and but these are now being embraced by people on the right and so what you see in the intellectual dark web as the Democrats continued to move into this multicultural egalitarian green equity movement is that those progresses were leaving behind the original liberal values including things like free speech whereas the people that have come Volkl supporting those super values were now people from the rain they were new rights they were Republicans that were doing that and why seem for example Brett says I don't even I'm flabbergasted at the fact that the right is now holding the values that as a leftist I grew up believing and almost all the people on the intellectual dark web including Dave Rubin Jordan Peterson will say I'm a classic liberal and it's not that they're at orange most of them are actually second tier the second tier is the stage that can integrate literally all of the first stages but what's getting left out is you have this green multicultural Michalik arianism that's being taken to such extremes it's really becoming absolute istic in its view so you have absolute istic to multiplicity to relativistic and the problem with relativistic is it becomes very open to what's called performative contradictions becomes very open to self contradictory statements it does it almost all the time so Edelman came for example that it is universally undeniably true that there is no universal truth it'll maintain that all knowledge is social construction it's all an interpretation it all depends upon which culture it's arising in and yet everything that I just said that represents the green point of view it maintains that it's view is not culturally constructed it's true for all people at all places at all time it's not a matter of interpretation it's got real truth nobody else has truth his objective truth doesn't exist but that view itself is held to be objectively true by the post modernist so they do get caught up in this enormous kind of contradiction and they do tend to absolute eyes their view there are two ways you can end up an absolutist ik beliefs one is that you're just on your way up through the growth stages yourself and you're at that stage and people by the way can state that states that entire adult life the fact that we have higher stage doesn't mean that you have to develop there it's one of the problems but so they'll have that AB statistic view just because they're on the way of passing through it but if at any higher stage you latch on to review with such absolute uncritical absolutism you can start to regress to the actual absolutist ik stage because that's where you feel right that's when you feel yeah this is I know I've got it right this is it say end up regressing to an absolutist ik ethnocentric stage and a problem with that is that it is ethnocentric it is tribal and identity politics lends itself to tribalism because what you're emphasizing is your particular tribe and you'll know if you're doing that from a world centric stance if when you talk about your tribe in addition to whatever important differences there are you also talk about what your tribe has in common with all the other tribes then that's world center there's a unity and diversity with that but if you just talk about your tribe and how it's different from all the other tribes and is there some sort of special attention is gas ethnocentric absolute istic tribalism and so what we have is original far-right ethnocentric tribalists being joined by a really highly developed progressive green identity politics that have regressed - that amps AB statistic retry Balai stage which of those two do you think is more dangerous right now well that depends in a sense on what community you look at the international dark web is mostly alarmed by the fact that the far-right and and by the way the even them not many of them have an actual developmental framework to interpret it with they still intuitively understand this stuff and so I think it was my she thought was that first began referring to that far left as the regressive left and that's what they were in tune is that this left is actually regressing back down to this ethnocentric absolutist at stage and the concern for them from Jonathan hi to Jordan Peterson to Dave Rubin is it college campuses are now overrun and academia itself is over run by believers in this absolutist ik green multicultural egalitarian identity politics and they're doing it so much they really are continue to regress to AB statistic stages and so in absolutist ik stages you don't even have to talk to the other person because your tribe is right you know your tribe is right anybody disagrees with you is Hitler and what's your bizarre is that we used to look at the far right for that kind of absolutist ik insanity now we're getting it from the far left that's exactly right it's like what the hell happened how did that occur and that regression back down to retry belies polarize stance that's part of the horrifying problem that we're now facing in culture wars that's when the main things driving it so the only value that was getting left out as you had these regressive wrote it had the normal fart right and the regressive far left is so Green was down to amber and amber was at amber and there was just orange sort of hanging out there by itself it had old Democrats who would really no longer speak up for that because the new democratic orientation is multicultural egalitarian identity politics and so the old traditional liberals and the Democrats don't have much of a say it is again Republicans that are now voicing support for individual rights free speech and so on their concern is that far-right hate groups a very real concern in the culture and very few IDW people would deny that but their concern it's the way it's moving into into academia and simply sort of taking over that that entire area most many of the people that belong to the installation so dye Club at one time started out as leftists and they were leftists when left meant orange liberal and then his left started to move into this illiberal egalitarianism and identity politics the original Democrats original leftists looked at and said I don't recognize that party anymore something's wrong with that and so most conspicuously somebody like Dave Rubin well actually you know have a whole pub conversion and say you know why I am no longer a member of the left and what they mean is this green extremist far-left regressive stance the regressive left that's really really a problem one of the things that needs to happen in my opinion if you look at all of these developmental models and you see these stages up to green they're all first here and you realize that first here by definition can't integrate each other they actually sort of disagree with each other they're greater or lesser extent but there's a disagreement all the way down as soon as you start getting to some of the stages the second tier they tend to look at all of the previous stages as being important they realize if nothing else everybody's born at square one it has to go through all those stages so we can't just look at somebody who's at ethnocentric amber we can't just look at somebody who's at orange we look at somebody at green and give them you know a nice hour to reasoned argument about why they're wrong and they shouldn't be you know thinking that way that's not how you move through stages of development stages of development you can't reason somebody out of the stage of development they're in somebody once said you can only reason somebody out of his stance that they were reasons dinh - well you're not reasoned into stages of development they start you know when you're one month old and you go through in PSA you know six stages of sensory motor development and then couple stages of pre operational development couple stages concrete operational and then into formal operational orange reason and so on and you have to go through it just a whole series of trial and error and working out of the stage trying to make it work when it starts to fail and you start to open yourself to new approaches and because we all have these high stages as potential in us them that happen is the next higher stage can start to come down what we're looking at right now and and one of the reasons I think that the intellectual dark web has particularly arisen at this time is that we really did have the emergence of this new stage of development and it really is radically relativistic radically egalitarian prison great deal of emphasis on equal outcome and she's any differences at all as the product of oppression or discrimination and that's what so many of the intellectual dark web people are fighting against they're not saying okay well they're saying look it's it's possible that some of that is oppression no doubt but they're also other reasons that we see these differences and they might have to do with different interests in male and female for example nobody is holding that as a absolutist ik view but it's a view that they're not going to rule out and you start to see this in a enormous number of important areas in terms of just how man on average and women on average have different types of interests in just what they find interesting there's no evidence they have different capacities it's not that manner cognitively smarter than women or anything like that it's just they have different things that they consider important in life and they tend to pursue those and part of the problem that hasn't been answered well with the green far-left feminists is okay which is how do we handle that if we have that in today's college the majority of degrees are going to women in almost every major area they're more women in medicine more women in law more women to psychology in sociology in psychotherapy and so on the only places that the men still dominate a surges the STEM fields and so are the fact that there are eighty percent of women in psychology then does that mean men are being oppressed I mean shouldn't we be doing something about that if we're trying to worry about getting it to 50/50 and those are the issues that aren't addressed very well the suggestion from developmental studies is it those kinds of issues start to first of all be conceived more adequately from second tier and second tier of canvases meet two stages of development that can actually integrate all the previous stages they do have a capacity to prioritize they do bring things together into coherent systems they'd have an enormous amount of diversity but they also have a common unity with them in your conversation with Tom and Mark you mentioned something very interesting about integral looks for what is missing because I often get criticized or people say you focus a lot of your content on the shortcomings of the left which is true and they say you don't focus so much on the right but your perspective is if the big problem for us moving forward is are the blind spots of progressivism then integral will automatically look at those more is that for exactly what you have with it certainly as far as I can tell the vast majority of the intellectuals on the dark web there have been several accounts of what they have in common I wouldn't necessarily disagree with those thinks a lot of truth to that but the one that I would add is almost all of them are thinking from second-tier stages they really want to know how all these things fit together and what they really don't want to do is just a priori exclude something because they just know that's wrong they don't do that and that's why there's this intentional drive for example to have open conversations among people that do have disagreements and this is actually set up as part of the ongoing dark web that's what happens as you know there's a whole series of shows on the road where Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson will argue these points and moderated by Brett Weinstein or Douglas Murray somebody like that and thousands of people showing up for these things and they last two and three hours people are enormous ly interested in these topics and that's what's so important about the fact that they are coming together on a place that this almost happened nowhere else but the net that does seem to be one of the ways the net is now kind of overcoming how it got derailed a bit when it started you know decade or two ago everybody particularly the boomers would say oh this is going to be a global brain it's going to unite all humanity it's going to be the single greatest unifying force in the history of the world and then about 15 decades later it's the single most polarizing thing that happened it just turns out that how you can search data means you can search for those things it's just you agree with and then you end up talking there and then you end up in the circle echo chambers and the polarization gets greater and greater and greater and then it's added to you by the so-called Mardi Gras effect in Mardi Gras when you're wearing a mask and people can't see you you tend to do a lot nastier things than if they could actually see who you are because you have a you have a mask well that's what social media is like you can mask yourself and be anything anything you want so it encourages you to come uh it's a race to the bottom in other words is a race to the to the not not our better angels but our worse Devils and those those tend to come out so now what we're seeing with dark webs a little bit of an overcoming of that we're starting to find ways of building these holes do you think this polarization is an existential threat yeah and certainly so what do we do about it certainly in terms of the degree of extremism of poet polarization I think Jonathan Hite did a study looking at polarization among typically polarized groups so he came up with a series of measurements that measured the degree of polarization between groups like male and female wealthy and disadvantaged black in white you know educated uneducated all that kind of thing and he has some sort of arbitrary scale that was something like around the 0 to 20 where 20 was most polarized and 0 was at least polarized and so he found things like male and female and rich and poor educated uneducated and so on that degree of polarization went up to about 10 points of separation and then there is a huge leap all the way up to left and right and that was 18 points I mean it was just that was off-the-wall polarized and what was even more disturbing is that if you'd looked at left and right say 50 years ago and you had polls saying what do you whether your left or right think about your opponents left to right and and typical answer would be things like I really do disagree with them I think their hearts in the right place but I I just can't agree with what they're saying the typical response now where the majority of responses are the other group they're evil they're just demonic there's nothing they say is right and the sooner we get rid of them the better that's not good and that's increasingly what's starting to happen particularly and one of the real problems is that as you look at these ongoing stages of development throughout human history you do have kind of a leading edge and it does tend to set the sort of tenor of the epoch of that time so you have really brilliant developmentalist like jean gebser who's traced these stages in terms of their worldview and so he finds we said there were on average six to eight stages up to today further stages coming but gasser comes up with stages that he named I'll tweak these a little bit but on our cave stage a magic stage a mythic stage a rational stage a pluralistic relativistic stage and an integral second-tier stage and those who are unfolding over history as well and part of what we're seeing right now is the emergence of that integral or second-tier stage really for the first time in history now it wasn't that there weren't very advanced individuals who had that kind of cognition certainly you know Aristotle patinas that kind of individual but in terms of having like around ten percent of the population reached those stages whenever we see about 10 percent reached that leading edge we do tend to see a sort of tipping point in culture and that's what happened with the Westerner alignment for example really only about 10% of the population was actually at that orange formal operational cognitive stage but those values just started to kind of seep out a bit and it wasn't that people would just fully accept them if they did they'd actually be at the Orang stage themselves but they were more open to them and and they became not as reactionary to them so even something like the American Civil War where you're having people fight to end ethnocentric slavery they're still less than 10% of the population is actually at those stages but you know impacted enough people that close to a million young men and women died trying to end slavery I mean that's those kinds of things are just profound the same thing happened in the 60s when we started to get a green emergence as soon as it went over around 10% we actually got the so-called revolution of the 60s and that was when we started introducing all of these radically egalitarian civil rights movements and so on and then even concerning the environment as a living organism we had to give attention to the environment and all of those were part of the healthy aspects of green is what they introduced but the problem is that as green continued to become more and more extreme more and more radical more and more egalitarian more and more equal outcome period that was the leading edge of our overall evolution starting right around the 60s and that's where all of a sudden we started to see this shift that people are still trying to figure out right now they're circling what the hell happened to liberal values this is a Democratic Party I grew up with and and and then also your people like licensing and this is the Republican Party I grew up with either there was this wild shift in terms between these fundamental value structures in addition to all these other things that were happening but this was happening and because green as a leading edge was becoming increasingly broken increasingly extremist and absolute istic and even regressive that's a disaster for a leading edge because it started to fall apart and it's self-contradictions caught up with it more and more and more all it really degenerative into four foundational places to rest was Neel ISM first of all because there is no objective truth so truth is out the window and then in terms of well what values are right no value is the right they're all equally right so narcissism is that leading edge tended to be governed by that tag team from postmodern hell niall ISM and narcissism and those are horrifying that you can't have a leading edge of culture driven by nihilism and narcissism because it has no conception of which way to go when all you've got is neo listen ok well I got no idea what's the right way to go so I'll just do my own deal and then everybody's you know retry belies and and it's a disaster I know many people who would say that your thought is one of the most influential things in their development in their growing up do you have a sense why and there was a real high-water mark for integral probably in the mid 2000s do you have a set had the impact on the world that you hoped it would have and and and if if not why not yes I've been very actually happily impressed by by how its how it's doing one of major my my students have have divided my overall work into five major stages and you can see a continuity through all of them and in an odd way they really do transcend and include I mean each of the each time I sort of proposed some some new additions to integral theory they're in almost all cases they've included all the previous stuff I don't disagree with that I've just added some more stuff that I found that's important and so it sort of keeps going like that when I hit around so called stage 4 it was a book called sex ecology spirituality and it really did cause a bit of a sensation at least in these small circles that think about these kinds of things and for about the next 10 years there was an enormous amount of theoretical talk about it and so that was happened all around the world there were over like I say the book has been translated into upwards of 30 the foreign languages they're integral Institute's starting or started in several dozen countries and so on and so there's this this really strong theoretical discussion about these issues again you can be critical any of the good ideas that came up I immediately incorporated but the net result of all of that tended to be essentially the same model that people had started discussion discussing there wasn't that many radical changes to it that that were put forward in unbelievable ways and that 10 years we went from around 1995 and the book was done till around 2005 but then after that 10 year period as the the framework emerged more or less intact people started taking it and just running out and applying and when they started doing that they they stopped in a sense having conferences on that or getting together in discussing that so it looked like it had just dispersed and in a certain sense it had but what had happened previously is that if you were theoretically thinking about something like this and we had journals that were being published at the time that were peer-reviewed based on integral meta theory and there were over 60 different human disciplines that were reinterpreted completely using this integral framework to make more comprehensive and inclusive and holistic approaches I mean we had internal education internal psychology integral sociology integral art into pro history integral medicine integral business integral law literally over 60 disciplines like that and all of them claimed to be happier with the result they certainly included more aspects than they had previously a lot of people are quite suspicious of spirituality yeah partly because they see that a lot of spiritual communities go bad and partly as a journalist I feel I have to ask you this question as well and there have been a spiritual communities that have had a lot of bad press that have gone bad the most high-profile probably being Andrew Cohen and he he's been very like even very close to him in the past what lessons can we learn from that yeah this is one item the general framework has shed an enormous amount of light on and again I'm not saying that there aren't other factors that are important but here's one that's really really central and it came up earlier when we mentioned things like yes Brutus can be doing this practice for certain Isis okay whoa I mean if all we're saying is you know do this kind of trying to find alternate unity consciousness that's not enough because it could produce Isis or it could produce a nice Buddhist community so what's the difference one of the most striking things we found is that if you look at that actual waking up or enlightenment experience which again wherever it shows up is claimed to be just simply by itself the Silman bonum just by itself it has everything that is perfect and and you get that and you've got it all you don't need anything else that is complete liberation those experiences aren't the first person direct immediate experiences so again it's not a belief system it's not even a mythic system in a typical sense of like Moses parting the Red Sea or Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt or anything like that these are direct immediate experiences that you have so you can't see these stages of growing up by introspective and one of the things that that means is that every major spiritual tradition including the meditative traditions that looked within and plumb the depths of first-person state experiences not one of them saw structures of growing up at all so there's not a single meditative system anywhere in the world that hasn't understanding into stages of growing up literally they're not there so that's why you can be it almost any stage of growing up and go through the whole sequence of waking up eight but you'll never know that you'll just be interpreting that according to the states of growing up that you're at and that turns out to be disastrous because up and kill around the Western enlightenment when that orange worldcentric grammar started to emerge people were having waking up experiences and interpreting them from each ethnocentric stages because that's essentially where they were and so they could have this extraordinary experience of oneness but it could be had only through their own particular approach and so they ended up being indeed ethnocentric even though they had this experience of oneness so that's how somebody in Isis who's literally at a viciously fundamental ethnocentric stage of development can still have this waking up experience but they're going to interpret it in terms of that ethnocentric stage this is an experience that I'm having with Allah and only those who accept Allah can have that experience and Samuel even say you know as these terrorist bombers are about to blow themselves up many of them sort of have this smile of bliss and contentment because they're in this mystical state of waking up and I'm sure some of them are but they're having it at this ethnocentric bigoted prejudice stage of development and waking up won't cure that that's the nightmare Loren Shorty's is almost none of the Western developmental models have any of the waking up states they don't have an understanding of enlightenment or awakening or the great liberation or moksha or Satori or any of that and so you have these stages of growing up and they have no understanding of waking up and then you have these systems of waking up and they have no comprehension of growing up stages and these two things are relatively independent it can be very high in one and very low on the other very high in this and very low in this but the point is there's not a single system in the world including spiritual systems that include both of those ever and that means humanity to us entire history has been training itself to be broken so part of the problem even when you have a religious movement a spiritual movement like Andy Cohen and they are very much aware of waking up station that's what they're after they don't have an understanding of these growing up stages and so they can be very much at ethnocentric with highly authoritarian guru dominant types of orientations and still be having stunning waking up experiences but then interpreting it all in terms of just this specific group is getting it and just their leader is the one that's giving this to you and that's exactly what Andrew Cohen got into and he understood integral theory quite well and he and I actually would do a dialogue in in their magazine what his enlightenment and when he ended up crashing well first of all he was always very appreciative about the integral model he talked about it a lot but he himself still got caught in these growing up stage aspects and he finally ended up interpreting what caused his crash is that he had this very mythic ethnocentric amber aspect of himself that really did take himself as being the one in ultimate guru it was the most enlightened person on the face of the planet this is all falling down into ethnocentric and he lower the stage right under that is ego centric and you had some questions about or doesn't that happen yeah that happens because it's just right there he got caught in that and that's how he came to interpret the problem and so he's it took several years off did a lot of work on that issue and he's now coming back he has something that I think he just calls integral Triple Gem something along that line and by the way Buddha Dharma Sangha that's another version of the four quadrants is another I we it Trinity so most of the problems with spiritual communities is that no matter how awakened they are truly having great degrees of waking up they're not addressing and they have no way to address that stage of growing up and as we've seen that can be in virtually any of these stages and it can be if you're at a deeply ethnocentric stage and you ever profound waking up all you've got is an enlightened not see literally that can happen by the way Himmler and those guys were really into yoga and these kinds of states josiah diocese one of their huge problems that we have with religion in the world today is it all of them developed when waking up was understood and there was no comprehension of growing up and so none of their teachings say oh and by the way make sure that as you understand these great truths that you're also developing so that you get at least into worldcentric because if you're less than that you're not helping you are literally going to be open to a fascist totalitarian nazi you name it bad news situation and all having a waking up experience will do is making you more certain of your presence in your and that is a disaster [Music] you [Music]
