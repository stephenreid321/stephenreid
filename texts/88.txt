so this is our first podcast from another country you're gonna have to believe us but we're in San Francisco we we've been traveling around we've done a lot of interviews with a lot of people we've got a few ideas for some new documentaries and we're gonna show you a picture now at the rebel wisdom 'mobile and yeah let you know some of the people that we've been seeing so we've seen a Kyra the Don he's got some amazing plans for an intellectual dark web Marvel Cinematic Universe so intellectual darkwave we've seen Jordan Greenhalgh Daniel Shmack Tim burger is kind of next-level futurist kind of guy and also as insisted by our supporters in the LA after our last podcast Paul Van der clay a pastor who's done a lot of stuff about Jordan Pederson we went to see a couple of days ago and we went to one of his services as well yeah one of his sermons so he filmed some of his sermon we filmed a really good interview with him so huge amounts of content coming up and for this podcast we're also going to talk about psychedelics because today in particular why don't you to say who we saw today yeah so today was Jim Fadiman who is one of the basically as known as the the father of micro dosing he's really I would say a psychedelic elder he's been around you know doing research really from the beginning and micro dosing in particular has become very popular and really beneficial for a lot of people in terms of creativity but also in terms of people using it for anxiety and depression so it was really really interesting conversation and a lovely man as well and then we saw Eric Davis who is one of my favorite thinkers actually Eric Davis he describes himself as having a PhD in high weirdness but his his PhD is actually in religious studies and he really looks at the intersection between technology and kind of the religious impulse and tribes and subcultures very you know one of his famous books is called tech gnosis so it's a really interesting kind of intersection between all those ideas it's kind of about how the religious impulse comes up through technology and it's kind of a big part of yeah the tech subculture yeah so and I think yeah we want to sort of fill in the gaps explain why so we've now done we did the Michael Pollan interview which we called the psychedelic Renaissance about three weeks ago and then we did an interview with Jamie Weil who is a flow state expert also talks a lot about psychedelics and this is something that we have yeah it's a big interest of ours we both got kind of a history with the psychedelic festival breakin convention and it's one of those areas of real kind of a sense of sort of possibility for shifting ways of thinking and shifting culture and I think that's why we're interested in it and especially there's a lot of talk right now and I guess we're both firm believers in the importance of being able to move beyond ideology to have generative conversations you know something starting to see in the intellectual darkweb it seems absolutely essential if we're going to find direction in the kind of chaotic times we live in and psychedelics more than any other thing I know about our deconditioning agents and decondition ideology incredibly well however they can go both ways and so that's that's part of the really interesting synchronicity is that Michael Pollan's book has come out and really bringing to the mainstream for maybe not for the first time but in a in a very new way the the power of these substances and so the other questions are how does one use them correctly and how yeah how do we navigate it because obviously you know we're sitting right now in San Francisco and in the late 60s there really was a massive mainstreaming of psychedelics that didn't go all that well it had its benefit it had massive downfalls as well so you know that's kind of an open question I guess we've been asking people about and toying with ourselves is how do we use them most effectively moving forward yeah we're literally about half a mile from Haight Ashbury from literally the intersection of Haight Ashbury which was ground zero for the 60s and the interesting question because we've talked about kind of ideological fixation and the interesting question is they were counter cultural agents in the 60s kind of the 1950s and 1960s there there was a very sort of firm cultural kind of traditionalist culture and they were what they were one of the big things that challenged that so the question that we're asking is are they still deconditioning agents or is because the ideology that we're in nowadays is a very different kind of ideology and I think we've all we we've we've done a lot of films and a lot of conversations about the nature of this new ideology are they still those kind of deconditioning agents given the fact that the new ideology is is much more the ideology that actually emerged from the 60s and we could argue we do argue has kind of become corrupt it started we've used kembers work quite a lot talking about it started as a very positive development that what he calls the green meme which is equality and and relativism and listening to other voices and including marginalized perspectives that is a good thing but then it became corrupt and became an ideology in its own right and do psychedelics still play the same role that now that they played then yeah and as we've been kind of asking people about it and I'm thinking about it as well and even as you're talking I'm I'm sorry I'm kind of inquiring into that myself am i yeah actually I do think that they can still decondition from any ideology you know if you if you look at shamanism throughout history psychedelics have been used for war they've been used for peace they've been used to heal they've been used to harm the you know Jim Fadiman who who we saw today is a big proponent of a real core aspect of psychedelic usage which is setting and set so setting is where you are always that set is what you're bringing to it yourself and those two things can really have a big big impact on it so in a sense you know part of the interesting one interesting question is how do we create the kind of setting and set now moving forward where a lot more people probably going to try psychedelics that's conducive to moving away from ideology rather than deeper in to the ideology we're in now because that could happen and that would be not a good thing yeah because we my question to Michael Pollan was is your book a moment where psychedelics become mainstream and he kind of said that it was and pretty much everyone we've spoken to since we've been here have a group has agreed that yes this is a very significant moment New York Times best-selling writer has written a best-selling book about psychedelic therapy people are people who have never tried psychedelics are saying wow I'm interested to try this it definitely is that crossover point so we've kind of been part of this conversation for I guess 10 years or so I first did a story about psychedelic therapy back in 2008 you've been part of the breakin convention Festival for a long time so I guess what we're interested in doing is is pushing that conversation on ok.now the mainstream starting to recognize the value of psychedelics okay fine but what that in itself is not that's not the end point the end point like I I've always been very frustrated with the psychedelic community of almost like fetishizing the psychedelic experience and not learning the deeper lessons of a psychedelic experience which even going back to Aldous Huxley was psychedelics cleanse the doors of perception but you see things so they remove a lot of filters so you see a lot of things more true to how they are how do you how do we start to live in that space how do we start to live beyond the psychedelic experience and not just kind of psycho yeah fetishize the drug and fetishize that state of mind and actually work on because I I firmly believe and this has been absolutely true for me that we have to do the inner work psychedelics we get a few freebies we get you kind of insights into how things could be beyond our conditioning beyond wow I'm one with the universe I I know what my true nature is all that sort of stuff and it's like yes great true but it's an ever decreasing circle if you keep just doing the drug without doing the inner work to really identify the blocks in yourself that stop you being in that space no not necessarily all the time but what are the things that are stopping you from from being in that state of flow in the rest of your life yeah and this is something that so in the last breakin convention happens every two years and the last two so starting in 2013 I think this has been the topic I've written and I'm spoken about which is I've called a psychedelic Shadow it's this idea that well so in kind of summary you can take psychedelics for 20 years and be having these peak experiences which I would call vertical that's kind of up and down and you can still Jim Philemon put it nicely you can still want to kill someone when they cut you off when you're driving and you can still you know here he also had a nice example it's like you you love everything but I hate my parents you know so there's something missing there this is something I started to see first in myself and then what actually helped me kind of get out of it a bit was having a really dark experience and encountering my shadow and realizing oh it's not all love and light so what I've kind of I'm loosely developing is is a model I call train trip integrate which is the idea that not you don't just need the horizontal you need what you were just talking about the sorry of the vertical you need the horizontal as well and the horizontal is the kind of work so work where you and you you work with other people it kind of did various types of therapy bodywork meditation a lot of different ways of understanding yourself and how you relate to other people to get away from the potential narcissism and away from the potential lack of development that comes with just tripping and tripping and tripping and that is something that the psychedelic community I think needs to really look or something Jaime will was talking about and I think what he said that was really really interesting that really struck a chord with me was that you know he he's traditionally come from the kind of ecstatic those ecstatic moments and how do you get into that kind of place and how does that then lead to being in a flow State Jordan Peterson is really bringing up the catharsis the lower levels that's all hard one kind of feels this kind of deep practical wisdom and it really feels like that's been missing from the psychedelic world it's all you know a lot of the time it's all love and light and crystals and bollocks like that and what it needs is the real encounter with the shadow and on that point that's that's one of the the points I made in what I wrote breaking invention is that the traditions like meditation they don't generally look at the shadow in the traditional uses something Ken Wilber Wilber points out you can meditate for 50 years as well and still be a massive asshole because you're not looking at the sides of yourself that you reject necessarily so you need something or some combination of practices that allows you to own your shadow allows you to know how to connect with other people in a way and have reflection on yourself and then also allows you to break into spaces where you think differently and where you can break free from your constricted thought structures so the point being it's not as simple as people just taking psychedelics a lot more has to go into it yeah I just had a sort of thought truth is a psychedelic truth is a psychedelic experience and this is something that Jordan Peterson talks about that aligning oneself with the truth is is what that's the deepest story of Western culture that's the logos and magical things happen when we align ourselves with the truth I'd never really framed it in that way but that has certainly been my journey since I did a lot of psychedelics at university and found it a really awakening experience at first but I went through that experience of ever decreasing circles and actually it took me quite a long time to recover from that sort of chasing that high and feeling I kind of coined the phrase living in the shadow of myself getting this sort of sense of who I could be beyond all of this stuff just a stuff that we live in on a daily basis and chasing that high and chasing that experience but then always coming down and and still still really struggling with with various things and it almost it being worse because I had a taste of what it would have been like without all of the kind of the day-to-day stuff and it wasn't until I started doing a lot of personal growth work you know work that I then started to kind of identify those places in myself okay this is where I shut down this is where I've got this kind of swing between grandiosity and worthlessness and all of these personality patterns that yeah I got from my parents I got from my yeah all of this other boring individual stuff that we all have that kind of keeps us trapped in some ways and it was only by doing all of that inner work that I really started to kind of align all those parts of myself and it the space that opens up for me you know in a workshop of sort of five or six days but I'm really sort of speaking my truth and really like dredging stuff off I'm really identifying it is a psychedelic experience and the risk of kind of giving a plug for our workshops that is what comes in with two or three days in a workshop experience you find a lot of these yeah it becomes this very powerful transformative where you can feel that you can feel in in in the room like that that level of what truth magic it's it's it's a similar space and so it's a flow state in that sense yeah and yeah that's a really nice point because for me and and for people who do psychedelic therapy professionally as well the truth is absolutely the key element of the experience that's that's curative because you can't hide on a psychedelic you can't hide from yourself and the truth is inner truth it's not so much the truth of this is how the universe is all constructed because you can't really share that with other people you know it's about your your own inner truth so it's around you know phenomenologically you're sitting and something's coming up some kind of negative feeling and you have to acknowledge and go into it it's like this is true you might not want it to be true but it's true it's happening and whatever is coming up psychologically is true for you it you know and whatever it is in psychedelic therapy they always say go into it you know my wife is currently training as a sitter in one of the studies and they say in the training you know someone might be experiencing serious paranoia and what they say is great go into it go on right into the paranoia get parent you know real and they're you know they're holding you in a context probably not yeah no that is the way you deal with it that is the way you go into it it's this real love of the truth and you have to kind of have that same attitude in a psychedelic experience or in a workshop experience yeah and very much gym Fatima was saying that today so yeah to kind of wrap this up the we're thinking about we're definitely going to continue doing a lot of interviews with psychedelic therapist psychedelic thinkers because this is yeah this is this is an area that we're both interested in and we both think has got a real value for for the culture yeah so and then just some final housekeeping to close we've started using the community tab at long last so if you want to keep up with with what we're up to and what content is coming up on the channel go on that tab and we've already posted a couple things from the trip and then also this podcast due to popular demand is going to be audio only as well as video only so we're gonna have that set up you wanna have a look at us yeah well have they're ready to set up for this podcast and then all the previous ones will be on there as well
