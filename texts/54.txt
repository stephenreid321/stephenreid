I see in this I think some of the force that's coming through him is collective its he is a he is a kind of channel for things that haven't been said for a while and that in some sense needed to be said it's a you know he said he's a kind of channel of the return of the repressed in that sense and he has the articulate potency of a person who is carrying more than just his personal thinking he's he's got a kind of collective psyches archetypal drive that is informing what what and how he is saying what he is what do you think those things are those repressed archetypal things well well one is to certainly his his calling upon men to kind of basically find their strong center again and take responsibility for their lives and their actions and to become disciplined and what what deaf psychologists would say it would be to basically integrate the Cenex the the that the Saturn archetype the archetype that brings in a capacity for for for self discipline for a backbone for that's grounded in tradition I think in some ways there's there's certain simplifications that he makes that are that are problematic and I just gave one set of them there with masculine feminine but it's also striking to me how much he gets simplistically misunderstood by both sides in the effort to impose a kind of stereotype on him which he I mean that famous was it a BBC or channel 4 interview with the awful talent human channel for interview with with Kathy Newman was quite an example of that where it didn't seem like she was really hearing the complexity of what he was saying and already had a pigeonhole that she was trying to kind of hammer him into and he was reacting against I'm I deeply admire his capacity to engage the world with a kind of articulate force he he's about 12 years younger than I am and I think has just a little bit more extroverted predisposition predispositions in him than I do where I you know I I prefer being a little less at the focus of even though some of my my work obviously pushes boundaries I'm not as eager as he seems to be or he certainly is capable of handling just a tremendous amount of like controvert controversy and the onslaught of aggressive questioning and so forth and he and he tends to do well under aggressive questioning which not not all of us do I think in general aggressive questioning can make it more difficult for the person who's being questioned and the questioner to to on dig deeper and unpack a more profound understanding that might reflect something that wouldn't have been included had that dialogue not taken place so but I have to say I am in real admiration of even though I don't agree with everything that Jordan Peterson says it's it's I really admire his spirit his capacity to think under pressure and speak to a number of audiences I think your work has been very how full in showing the the the value of what Jordan Peterson is doing and you you must also given given your work be very pleased to see him kind of bringing young back into the mainstream we're talking about going in such a high-profile way yes there there are I don't know how much that's coming in as a return of the repressed but it but you know it's it's interesting young himself over the last decades seems to be going through a quite a in elevation within the culture and when the New York Times gave that you know 17 pages in the New York Times Magazine to the publication of Young's red book about ten years ago that was pretty much the first positive thing that the New York Times had allowed itself to say about young since the very good obituary that it wrote for him in 1961 it it got kind of overtaken by a by you know a kind of you know narrower Freudian intellectual viewpoint and then an even anti Freud at a certain point anti depth I college II generally and I think the more we're moving into what I would think of as the deeper and more mature form of the postmodern and the more voices that are being allowed into the cultural conversation the more young I think is going to be recognized as not a flawless thinker but a but a necessary and deep one necessary for us to to assimilate he he was carrying deep deep truths that came from a very deep dive that he took a kind of almost shamanic descent that spontaneously happened to him in the nineteen thirteen to nineteen twenty P Rhea dand he came out of that with with real like basically the end that he gave to the culture the idea that we don't understand human psychology unless we understand that psyche is soul and that there is a spiritual dimension to human existence and to human fulfillment that if we do not take account of it we are mutilating ourselves and we'll never really be psychologically healthy or his recognition that we're all embedded in a larger collective psyche that is evolving and that is is going through its own spiritual transformations and that we're in a kind of adventure of of consciousness individually as well as collectively I think Jung's recognition of in the end of it on the individual level of how important the second half of life is and the turn towards away from external public achievement and more recognising that the inner world and finding meaning and finding a spiritual fulfilment that is not dependent on youth and a kind of robust quality of being in the world but has is connecting with some deeper sources of archetypal meaning and purpose that give us a sense of life's value all these are crucial gifts that Jung gave us and and I think more and more people are assimilating
