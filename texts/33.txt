[Music] my thinking on this was that I've been doing all this music sampling people talking about stuff and some of these people are public intellectuals and some of them are former Navy SEALs but it's all people that I think have got something a value to add to the concurrent conversation of what's important right now at this really important point of development as a species anyway so yeah I could be thinking about all these people as kind of characters and archetypes and what have you you know this expanded almost like a universe I started to think of it like the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's like the meaning way of the universe and each person had a part to play and I figured well Peterson who was the first one I did was kind of like the Iron Man figure who you know he's a kind of like earthly science-based character he's not too out there or too crazy or anything you know people was talking about stuff that was on an earthly level that people could regular people could relate to and stuff in the same way they launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man who was a guy who built a suit you could imagine that being a true thing that could happen you know and then it expands and then he gets to like Doctor Strange you like brings in the idea of magic and then somehow you can do anything and so I was thinking about the characters in it like this then I was thinking about the IDW was kind of being like The Avengers who you know we're sort of group of of powered individuals who were gathered together for a critical moment so as regards to each one was I don't know I mean what but before what what is your take on the IDW anyway what is what does it mean to you what is it really know well I think for a little bit just go down the road you're going down right let's say that because I'm interested in finding that out but I was noticing as this one is it if I like the irony they have the fact that at least one of the characters in the story that you're telling Jordan Peterson tells the story about how you create mythologies of the mythologies new abstract up and you're telling a story which is embedding his story in the context of the mythology of storytelling and I was noticing as you were talking I sort of imagining how this shows up in all the different kinds of mythologies like are they actually Greek heroes or are they like I have like a comic book image that has a whole bunch of different like shamanic heroes from a bunch of different distinct lineages all somehow being called into place but the this notion of there being like a reference to the myth of poetic layer the reference to the to the archetype layer and then each each of these particular individual human beings for their own reasons because of who they are and how they show up in the world has access to some portion of the myth the poetic layer and we're in mythopoetic times that's for sure the mythopoetic layer you can also call the architect or the archetypal yeah it's two two words it's not ludicrous if you imagine that the archetypes are always existing and so the superheroes will take of archetypal archetypal structures yeah they've been out they've been out gods for a while and they've introduced those concepts to the past couple of generations just as sort of religions sort of died off in the West or like the religion that we had bros Superman and Wonder Woman and the x-men and all these people sort of take these places so a child who's born now who might not read the Bible stories will certainly read the superhero stories or L will see them in movies and if if the the IDW are kind of self-selecting they've been self selected by the culture it would make sense that they would also fill those kind of archetypal holes that they'd be required to fill those archetypal holes oh well then we can use that to maybe make sense of the question you asked me some of the characteristics that seem to be showing up in these individuals are for example courage yeah they have the archetypal virtue of courage which is sort of notably absent from art yeah there was someone asked me like why even made some music with Peterson in the first place of what I likes by him and the first thing that came to mind was courage was bravery yeah who is someone standing up for something right whatever that is in in the face you could imagine that like a deep level like in our in our bones or even in our like reproductive organs the part of us that has been all about how the hell do tribes survive has a deep sense of when there are when the no courage were probably so when when we feel an absence of courage and then courage shows up we're like okay that whatever that is it needs to happen yeah right and so that's one one piece and then the other piece that we also see is well I guess I'm gonna break this into two one is this notion of a an unreasonable attraction to the truth all right so a sense of a willingness to say to take pain to like suffer in in defense of what is perceived to be true all right so rather than being able to capitulate or to equivocate saying no I'm just gonna kind of like come in and say what I think is true and almost almost blindly not like calculating when I take the consequence I think it's a good idea but for some reason I'm just wired is one of these people who just can't feel good about things not being true and then the other aspect over here is something about stepping out like a bigger picture like zooming out and taking a look at things that are not right in front of us and trying to say like wait a minute something's going on and again look if you think about this in terms of just straight evolution you can imagine that there's a situation where we've been encamped in a valley for a long time and it's worked out we've got a good way of being and but we're noticing for example that maybe the hunt isn't producing as well as it used to where the watering hole seems to be getting drier every couple of years and most people still are just kind of like that's not there there's nothing thing and they're just focused on what's going on but a couple of folks they step back and like wait a minute what's that mean like what's happening here and something there whoa hold on guys we may have to leave now leaving the valley is dangerous as going from where you are where things working understand what's happening to a new place is a really bad idea so it's not gonna be well-received which is why it takes a certain kind of courage to be willing to step up and say it but because we've had to do that a lot to be humans and humans more than any other animal we're the only animal that is in fact designed the ability to get up from a whole niche like to leave the African savannah and migrate to the to the Arctic we're the only animal that has to have some system that's able to be able to detect when it's time to do that alright so then this is the Buddhist step back and try to figure out okay what is the basis that we can actually use to perceive a bigger pic that allow us to make good choices in an environment where something is wrong and it's gonna be very subtle like you can't what name it very well if it's at the mythopoetic layer so maybe that's what I think is that that's what's happening it's showing up so it's also perhaps a superpower to be able to detect that I think it's a if we're using the word superpower in its market typical sense it is for sure superpower as we just described it yeah and it's listened to all the times summon the man or the speaker or whatever they whoever's required at that point in time always seems just show up mm-hmm and now whoever's showing God be showing up and it's the Internet is allowing that to happen it's kind of yeah well yeah yeah this is I mean cuz it does spread I still one of those things that people don't I don't think people fully grasp the enormity of it an idea as person and say I think and it can just reverberate throughout everything it's all me well spoke about this before but I feel the Joe Rogan is by far the most influential broadcaster of the last decade and it's probably more influential than any broadcaster who came before him at this point a selection of guests on his show can shift the course of culture completely someone can go on there and introduce a new concept and millions of people that will then spread and people could adopt that thing immediately whatever it is with regards to the IDW as superheroes I don't know where that puts Rogan didn't you think Nick Fury I like the Nick Fury feel ya know but then I was like maybe I require steins Nick Fury because it was Weinstein seems to be kind of pulling things together a bit and seems to see something coming that requires these particular individuals to be assembled this is a generational thing and I connected Nick Fury is Nick Fury and his Howling Commandos yeah not Nick Fury agent of shield yes there you go when his agent of shield Eric won but I this is it yeah I grew up with you know the first fury be has been completely eclipsed by samuel l.jackson fury and you're blind yeah totally different guy like full blank yes if you think about the guy who's sort of like does this super spot yeah there's two guys chomping yeah the guy who can like - man that's that's broken bad yeah if you think what the guy who's like more of the intelligence operative who is able to figure out how to make things happen inside large complex bureaucracies where there's betrayers here and there and kind of but can you know really is at the end of the day at his core the same guy right his essence and can then bring people together on the basis of hero right it called out the hero essence when it's needed that's much more Eric yeah that's exactly the court call out the hero essence when needed yeah yeah and that's where this key thing and put is that we now have that this is part of the whole sort of internet versus old media thing it just wasn't possible before in the same way that was it Kirby wasn't Morrison anyway I think Kirby or Morrison with you know would say that comics is kind of the ultimate art form because you can do anything within it and you can tell the story as long as you need to and you can have any kind of special effects and you know it's kind of doesn't have the limitations of movies or television and Internet has done that with idea spreading and meme spreading it doesn't have the limitations that television or newspapers or any of these things had you can spread the meme as trans McKenna will talk about in it almost infinite fashion you can take an idea and it can disseminate as far as as far as it can in a way that it just wasn't possible before wasn't imaginable before let's take it further than that because as you as you were saying it I was trying to feel into the like comics and then Internet and I was noticing that I was just to do it this way the thing that happens in the Internet when you're doing something on the Internet I guess kinda like what we're doing is that you're engaging in a what the hell was that called a beautiful corpse is that right we were that phrase in art in in in broadcast in a mode like say in the moment that the Beatles were on The Ed Sullivan Show there's a huge impression of an idea into the culture but it goes one direction and it's received and the ability for that to them become generative creative on its own basis is only out here right so a bunch of kids of course for sure were inspired by the Beatle he generated rock and roll and moving back out but on the internet what happens is that if somebody watches this perhaps to say a fabric that's trying to be expressed and it's not our responsibility or our power to express all of it all we have responsibility for is to move it a little bit further and to participate a little bit our piece or anybody else who happens to be participating in this in any way watching it commenting on or creating their own video in response like tomorrow obviously this is a virtual tomorrow tomorrow after they watch it they could create something else and part of that fabric and they're equivalently empowered to everybody else to actually be participating in that so what that does is that actually erases remember like I think was Foucault who did the birth of the author we're talking about the death of the author the end of the notion that the human being is the agent of creativity and the recovery of the notion there being some kind of more collaborative sense where you're generating and pulling in this the source of creation is happening outside of us entirely there's something really interesting as well about the kind of marriage of high and low culture that we've got these incredible deep ideas coming out into the culture and then we're kind of you're turning it into music you're turning into something that's really accessible but it doesn't feel because of the time we're in and the way that the internet works it kind of feels right like that those those barriers between high and low culture seem to have been kind of almost completely if you're born after 1990 they don't exist you don't have a concept of that really so this is this is Joe Rogan I mean the idea that Joe Rogan is kind of the the Herald of yeah well it makes completely select all it will reawaken of course it would be Joe Rogan because Joe Rogan is kind of honest with himself enough to know that he doesn't know everything lots of smart people aren't smart enough to know they don't know everything he's inquisitive and he's interested and he's also a trippy individual there's something about you talk about sovereignty quite a lot by Rogan is someone with a huge amount of sovereignty from the fighting from the kind of deep embodied nature of a lot of what he's doing which seems to translate into the kind of having the courage to go into the intellectual realms and like you say kind of admit that you don't know something was there's a lot going on I mean when we were only things that we didn't just mention was he also he made his living as a stand-up comedian yeah that's the massive event continues to a third yeah but he continues it's not like that's a side gig that's like his main passion and that's a skill set right that's the capacity to simultaneous to be able to use your mind to think of and receive things to convey through speech but to read a room is the hardest thing reality it's a level above deejaying on that DJ's have no reading a room of working out how to take people on a journey but then making them laugh yeah it's that's the hardest that's why comedians don't get any good until they've been doing it for about 20 years like no no young comedian is actually very good they might say something funny now and again they might be good at Twitter but like they're no good they're not good they're not good on that level of true greatness that a great comedian is so they've been doing it for 20 years or something till I don't give a till they don't give a yeah yeah it doesn't that's one of them well they have to be able to be in that space that flow yes and have the skill set to them be in that space of flow yeah because you have to have trained yourself to have the capacity flow by itself is gonna get it done so then what you say that his sovereignty and talking about his sovereignty his sovereignty in this in this environment is very large but he has a capacity to be able to perceive what's happening he has a capacity to be able to notice the way that it's being expressed in the real environment of an actual dialogue so that it will be heard with an audience he can feel the audience and understand how the audience is gonna be able to respond what's happening he himself and his body has already been trained to be able to be punched in the face and not shirk so as things are happening to him that might actually be pushing him that's not going to move him at all he's actually able to hold like a particular location in the dialogue that enables the dialogue to be able to be whatever it can be and then increase his capacity to be heard using his skillfulness as a as a comedian that's actually a it's one of these things right we live in we live in a world where we'll stay actually run back the clock so a thousand years ago there were like nine jobs and what your great-grandfather did it's what you were probably gonna do and you didn't need to change it very much like stuck in a rock on top of a rock once you kind of figured out the basics was the way it was gonna be thatching all right the science of thatching is more or less figured out it has not changed and then you know as you fast-forward what ends up happening is there's more and more things that we have to have had to learn how to do and they're changing faster so you know it's funny it's an odd thing to say but I think it's actually quite true to say that if you're trying to imagine like if I was going to have a 15 year old kid come to me and say well what kinds of things might I want to study to be able to be really capable in the world that's happening say well perhaps you should learn how to do mmm a stand-up comedy and then maybe figure out how to create your own public media and persona and if what's funny is that all those are available as you said like your son is writing are doing roadblocks he's already learning 19 fundamental skills in that environment and his base skills right that are core so yeah Scott Adams has this idea of the talent stack like if you're going to be successful in the modern world and able to navigate having a bunch of complementary skills like a whole bunch of them so rather than being  good at one thing like you're the best in the world one thing but that's all you've ever done that's a lot of your success is going to rely on luck at that point of being in the right position to be able to execute with that one thing you have a bunch of complementary things this is what I've done I realized I like just out of forced necessity I've made music but I then forced myself to learn graphic design and video editing and social media and marketing and all these other things in order to complement that and I have a bunch of these skills a pretty high level they're all work together to mean that I can function and release music and videos and things like three times a week speedily I can do all these things yeah well I mean I think that we talked about I know how this the timeline works here so I know how to reference or invokes but to me is in the recent past which me in media world be in the distant future but this notion of there being an actual stack in terms of like information knowledge skill capacity there's a there's a basis there so like you may have have learned information about what was it was one of the skills he just mentioned design so I might read a book on design of just absorbed information well I may have knowledge meaning that I've now been able to learn like I know it I know the information well then a skill is very different right I've actually practiced it in somewhere I've learned how to actually use it in some fashion more than a capacities deeper which is maybe the ability to have to read and the ability to understand how to build a skill as a capacity and so you know as the world becomes more complex and as things change you have to go deeper on the stack in the fact that I may know something is irrelevant Google knows everything better than I know anything the photo in fact that I have a certain amount of skill is relevant but it's changing it needs to be glued together so these capacities the deep capacitors are the things that are invariant ryun's that's the stuff that's at the depth high bridge for a little bit though because there's actually an interesting point that I'm not sure if it's useful it might I felt I felt deeply called to actually channel Heather hang in the high in low culture so she she particularly calls out at least in my experience I don't know what she's been doing publicly is this notion of so high culture is an evolutionary niche and low culture is an evolutionary niche we should to say that there's an audience the rich or the aristocratic and there's a producer artists of a certain sort who over time learn how to figure out how to explore that niche and so they realize that creating music of a certain sort appeals to the taste of this particular subset and this particular subset appreciates it it oftentimes largely just so that they have the ability to exclude other people and show that their posh and smart right yeah high culture is that direction low culture is a different set of things you're trying to appeal to right low culture doesn't necessary have as much of a need or value in trying to differentiate themselves from other people but if they could have a good laugh right if they can actually feel a certain sense of connection or a sense of uproar ease and that's good rest of different values well this is concepts in evolution called hybrid vigor where as if the niche if that if the niche between the the aristocracy and the common people is separate for a long time these skills specialize here and these skills specialize here and they're different they're Twain right we have high and low culture sconce EPS but when this thing starts to break down when a new niche emerges these skills need to reconnect with these skills why you need to have like a Joe Rogan you need to have a sensibility of the low culture how do I get to get a lap but then me like Russell Brand you also have to sensibility of okay what are these things that kind of titillate these sensibilities and build a sharpness or capacity to confront and you can combine them you have hyper configure you have this new species which has a vastly higher capability of exploring a new space a novel environment and I think it's reasonable to say they were in a novel environment I kind of get the sense with the IDW at the moment that it's it's an initial kind of stake in the ground for a new kind of conversation it's sort of it's almost like people gathering together to say okay we need to be able to have conversations about these certain topics so I kind of sense that it's already doing its job in terms of staking out kind of an area to have that where do you think that goes do you think we end up with this kind of cinematic universe getting more and more characters is this something that's going to continue to grow do you think once this thing has happened once and it comes the bravery aspect oh you can go out there and talk about these things and you don't die they don't kill you immediately you don't care like you don't lose your job melee or whatever some more people will do it and anyway then there's more of an appetite for it is normalized to an extent so it doesn't seem weird anymore like people are running around with capes and we I could do that too you know and then you have people who only and then you've got a world of the youngest younger people who've only ever known a world of capes that's completely normal then and then you can have really big conversations so it can it can only grow and it can only get more interesting and they extend this or take this as a as a push which is if you think about the the notion of sake counterculture if you think about that what was the line say hello to the new boss same as the old boss if you think about what the IDW is doing as being just a counterculture to a centralized narrative structure I think that's wrong that's not the point and so you what I would say is what happens next is what's happening right here because on the one hand we're not part of the IDW and there's no real particular intent or notion of this being like the IDW Junior League which is endeavouring to figure out how to become the IDW like are we using this to become part of that no but on the other hand we're we're presenting the same process we're representing the same field which is say okay how do we come together and begin to have conversations how do we actually practice this thing that is about how we come together and become more capable as individuals and as groups at being able to think and to be able to ultimately make better choices and be able to do things in the world and so what I would expect or hope is kind of like a rhizomatic growth that you'll begin to see a proliferation of quite diverse and heterogeneous groups like you said the West Coast Avengers just pop up and they aren't about August Hawkeye was but they weren't worried about becoming a member of the Avengers they were about doing their own thing right and that's the idea right is that it's because this playing field is in fact perfectly flat it is smooth across the board it's now more of a this is a way to play a game there's a new kind of game a new kind of way of playing it and it is no longer at all about the old boss it's actually about a completely new dynamic I guess this is what thinking looks like and now you've seen what thinking looks like maybe you can do it this is a superhero this is what a superhero is this is what he does this is what he stands for he's trying to  wants to save the world he's an emblem of the potential of humanity and we're at this point where we're about to as we've talked about but it's either death and destruction or glory and Wonder it's either like everything squandered or the potential realized like sort of now is you know the time is now and only you can save mankind which is this sort of message of the superhero or whatever which is the message of the superhero isn't someone's gonna fly in and save your ass it's like only you can  save what needs saving and that's what you need to do is become your own personal life yeah become that or whatever it happens to be I mean you made you it may actually be in a position where you're helping save something some other environment yeah you might actually save the actual world yeah you might actually might be that big yeah that's possible that's potentiality at this point but of course no I it's funny because we now have this in the environment I can I can say that but also be mindful of part of the message that Peterson is spreading which is it's not necessarily the case that is your particular responsibility to save the world and not everybody needs to run out of the costume and bang someone round the head because like you'll get  up if you're not ready if you ain't done the training later you know you can trigger a video go out there and be Luke Cage if you don't know how to punch it and I guess the other the other superpower is the ability to have the conversations which is what you were talking about with courage the the ability to get yourself into the space where you can have a generative conversation is in itself a kind of superpower it's a bunch we talked about outside the notion of curation as well which is the same kind of skill set so in a conversation there's a notion of me listening to you in trying to out of the thing that is being endeavoring to be expressed how do I identify the highest possible aspect of that because there are many right and of course in traditional debate or even the lowest aspect in turn what you're saying into some my effort is try to find the highest SATs but can bring that out and then send something back to you that is honoring what you said I'm not changing I'm just trying to listen and bring it up well we can do that in a conversation that's how you have a good conversation right we actually oh and that's neat that's interesting let me add more of that it's there more here but you can also do that in the meta conversation and if you're watching this video you're part of the conversation but in a meta level you can curate it you can up regulate it and share it or you can add your own voice to it as that's the ideas we can actually recognize that the same set of skills to be well honestly just to be in relationship with yourself well just to be able to speak and think clearly as an individual in congruence and integrity shows up as the set of skills to be able to do it as a group and then as it turns out to do it as a collection as a community yeah unmask this is one of the things that people don't necessarily talk about with regards to the influence of YouTube is that the the the way that people act interact with the YouTube video pretty much according to research as they look at the video they start watching it and then immediately scroll down the comments almost immediately so the the comments section people reacting to the video is seen as much as the actual thing itself like is as important we were talking about this earlier in regards to I think it was a dreadful mistake for the conversations with Peterson and Harris to not be broadcast live yeah they should have been streamed live people could be everyone would be getting any information at the same time and kind of like working on it together at the same time and that there would have been a vast conversation this a big part of that it's Peterson talks about how he likes to speak live and he can see from the reactions of people out there like how is things how it's going down and that's the comment section now you know YouTube comment sessions can be full of morons but they're also full of what's the opposite of a moron I don't know whatever like I see some other people who are watching this people in my comment section my comment section is like 99% like smart thinking humans so you have something valuable to add well it's funny I mean we we have this Peterson in Admiral McRaven the guy who said Peterson clean your room McRaven is make your bed but we have this sort of bite-sized ethical mandates you know things to anybody where they are can do and it's good it's gonna make a move so here's an example make better comments did you said it can be horrifying and it can't be horrifying because for whatever reason many people believe it's appropriate to be irresponsible in their cons hey but guess what there's also personal responsibility on the part of the curator at the comments section which is the person who wears the channel and some people think oh it's it's anti-free speech to like delete like a rude comment or something I personally think this is my house you do not come in my house and spread shits over the walls and if you do i remediate lee remove you from my house I can do that it's sort of good modeling yeah because it's what's that what's the theory of like you go you know you go into a neighborhood Brooklyn is ya the broken window thing exactly I think it's the same with that so anyone who runs a YouTube channel has a huge responsibility if you're gonna just let your comment section turn into a ghastly  show then that's that's what you're putting out into the world and that's what you're gonna propagate well maybe because put a stake in the heart of with the idea of free speech is because I shock to me that we live in a moment where that still isn't clear yeah so what is this concept and I think we're living in an environment now we can may even be able to say it quite clearly which is free speech is about the degree to which one is able to provide high quality high bandwidth signal that is insightful all right so free speech is that so if you if I convey to you high quality meaning that the there's a clarity of expression high fidelity meaning it is in fact actually precisely what it is that I am perceiving and endeavoring to express I'm not lying or manipulating I'm not trying to do anything with it other than expressing it isn't high-bandwidth meaning there's a whole lot to it and deep inside which is the thing that's being expressed is worthy of being expressed at the level that's being expressed right so those characteristics are where free speech is now if you're violating any one of those four parameters then you're not engaging in free speech all right so if I censor you I'm doing something which is shutting down at a minimum the bandwidth right if I am misinterpreting you I'm shutting down safe the fidelity of what's happening if I'm manipulating you I'm definitely should know that the fidelity I mean I'm hijacking the communications channel is we could have values information theory which we probably ought to it since we live in the information age to redefine this character this concept in a modern way it actually makes much more clear the thing we're dealing with and so it helps clarify if I'm running a message board and people are engaging in things that are creating noise right they're not actually generating either insight they're not actually taking the time to have something to say before they vomit on the web webpage or of course they're engaging in trolling which to say they're engaging in expression that pretends to be one thing but is in fact something else these are all just forms of noise and so we can it's not hard to identify mister noise is very clear that those are all know is great it may not be obvious that a particular thing happens to be noise but it's clear that if it is trolling and not authentic expression but it is noise when we could eliminate it and then what ends up happening is as you say then you've now generated a venue where everybody's beginning to see oh okay I get what good action actually looks like exactly this is a thing this there's lacking it's this is such a new thing is it such everything this is this vast experiment and so you have a situation where you can go in and just say what you think immediately and it's seen by lots of people that's very exciting for people it's like this sort of drug rush room I can go on that tweet thread and all that famous person and lots of people will see me say this thing and I'm a hero and there's not been enough time passed for people to really work out hey the repercussions of that on a big societal level because it is big repercussions the fact that you couldn't that comment of whatever thing is is seen by almost as many people as the main thing and that top comment was first was that we've kind of moved past that that would that was late 2010 2012 you know that's when people said and they were home I will look and things like that seems like such a bygone era the emergence of high culture in our particular new vernacular so this is this new new world and the rules haven't quite been laid down yet and people don't quite know how to act yet but they're starting to I'm seeing it's starting to happen I'm seeing comment sections getting a lot more useful and this is curation is a big part of this and you said something really interesting as well that a lot of people who are commenting are actually in broadcast mode rather than digital mode that in some sense if you're responding to someone at something as yes I like this no I don't like this that's actually broadcast whereas digital is this is what I like about this and this is what I don't like about this as a constructive there's a dialogue there's an implicit dialogue in commenting on digital that there isn't with broadcast if you think about the the mental metaphor of the former is I'm changing the channel yeah and that's the best the psychology of broadcast mode where I have no authority or capacity or ability to interact or express on my own the only power I have is to change the channel to remove my attention as all I have right but in the interactive environment I have the ability and therefore how the duty of learning how to wield that power well of curating with detailed nuance up regulating and down rigging but and then also adding I can actually express into it so yeah I think it's it's it's it's novel and the environment we've exited has been one that is very different so not only is it a place where we're having to build new skills but these new skills are quite different to the old skills and yeah you're especially like when you move into the suburb when the suburbs extends itself and people begin to grow lawns in places that didn't used to have like here in San Diego where's its desert you get this very interesting experience at actually watching an ecosystem develop in the first season there are no bugs because it was desert in the second season the bugs have come the third season the birds come and it's over about ten years you finally get an ecosystem we're kind of doing that right in the new home ho ho moon the first guys there were bugs exploiting an opener it's interesting as well yeah I think you've just explained the moral rule that you were saying with is that people who are comment have power and with that comes responsibility and that if we're yeah as curators it's okay to to remove people who are not exercising their power now the people who noticed this first in the Cardinal web part of the comic book analogy this is but this is ties in with the new where we're going but it was the the smart trolls the ones who realized that they did have a power and they had a power to change things in a Chaos magic type fashion they had a power to sort of collectively push sort of ideas and change people's perceptions of people via sort of like meme affiliations or outright falsehoods or weird jokes or creepiness or whatever it hits this was a thing that a generation discovered they discovered they had a huge sort of what would have been previously called sort of chaos magical power and now you have all sort of generation who are aware of that as a complete normal thing as in that's just normal that's real it's not theoretical it's not me jacking off over a sigil in a room hoping I can find my car keys yes it's that never worked for me by the way thank you Grant Morrison didn't work but it's the thing that you've seen as a prize as practical really really works you can sort of all gather together and change the course of of discourse or history or whatever by combined action so the first people who discovered that it's kind of like the way porn dictates technological movements you know it wasn't necessarily the sort of most useful use of that power or the best use of that power or the most heroic use of that power or whatever but it's out there now people know so now it's a thing that can be harnessed for good and can be harnessed for sort of heroic super heroic means of like saving the world and shifting the culture and all that sort of thing there's like a whole bunch of kids you just know that that works they can do it it's completely useful and usable so then it's like what more we do with that power today yeah so that would be the the meaning of the IDW at its depth it is re discovering and re presenting the hero archetype in this new environment and then inviting anyone to become a hero do you actually say okay this is what it feels like this is what it looks like and as you said and anybody can in fact in some sense everybody both should and must man exactly that's the thing they're actually monsters yeah you must but it's not easy and you have to put in lots of work yeah this is you can't just put on a cape and jump off a building and expect a flight this is the calling so Eric Weinstein is a very smart guy and you're not likely if you're just sort of a person out in the world to sort of wake up one morning and have his level of intelligence and dedication but we're just people there's nothing about us that makes us you when somebody could decide to in comic books die ahead we do to read comic books right there's not I'm not a differential geometry but if you just decide to enter into this kind of conversation that's the beginning and it's amazing how rapidly just the process of learning from other people listening learning how to listen learning how when you're shutting people down because for whatever reason your fear or anger is causing you not to listen and then learning right how rapidly that just builds these skills like it's it's not I'm gonna say it's not hard it's actually hard yeah but it's not the kind of thing that effectively everybody couldn't do it's the thing that everybody can do and this is a thing that's been emerging recently in the conversation is that for many many years we were told we were stupid and then we could only handle six minutes of television and actually our attention spans were getting shorter and shorter and we were just absolute  idiots we could only handle by like tweet information and MTV or whatever it was it turns out that was completely untrue it turns out we can sit down for like three hours and listen to someone talking about something that we know nothing about and that we're very interested in it and it's not just like a little niche section of the population over here and everyone else is stupid dumb staring at the TV is actually way bigger than that and it's probably most people it's looking like now it's actually looking like most people are really smart and most people's capabilities for handling these kinds of subjects and expanding upon them we don't even know what the limits are you look at the Jordan Peterson phenomena it's like someone's talking about Bible lectures incredibly deep Bible that yeah it's  Turing Studios stadiums yeah which Jordan Peterson also came to mind when you were discussing the nature of that conversation because there's something in the the sort of the symbology of the Christ archetype is that you die to yourself every moment and there's something in allowing parts of yourself to die off to be reborn like things that were wrong so indulge in engaging in these conversations where you're allowing parts of yourself to die off but maybe beliefs that you had before or things that are stopping you there's a sense of as he also says that you have to allow your dead wood to be burned burned off if the river stops flowing then it stagnates and closes ship rose in it well it's funny because you know if we had been in I don't know 1880s or so this would not have been a particularly notable insight I don't know why but many people had the basic insight of let the the the dead would burn off that your job is to constantly be renewing yourself in the context of a particular situation back then it had more of the basic sense of like being tough like being honest being strong being powerful in the world that you have to learn and allow yourself to grow now we can actually do it in thinking a more fully realized way to and therefore not have secret things that are sort of embedding themselves and surrounding themselves and ever allowing things to burn off except for them then he actually can be completely open to whatever happens to be coming through and build like a very deep sensitivity what was his oh it was Nietzsche that tuned to philosophize with a hammer and the notion that it's a sculptors hammer that's not a sledge hammer it's a thing that knocks wood precisely that which prevents the statue from revealing itself and so do building to developing a level of artistry with self so that you can actually allow precisely that which should go away like what is the dead wood yeah it's not obvious getting skillful at that is a powerful skill
