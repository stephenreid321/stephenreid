more than 90% of the people who watch my videos on YouTube are men now that's weird because not about 80% of psychology students are women so that is not what you would expect right and so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly and then the other thing I've noticed is that I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights but about responsibility right because you can't have the bloody converse what are you doing you can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion and we're only having half that discussion the question is well what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out responsibility and then the question is well what are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life that's what it looks like to me it's like here you are suffering away what makes it worthwhile right you know you're completely oh you're completely you have no idea what you're you it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is responsibility that's what gives life meaning it's like lift a load then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless easily hurt easily killed why should you have any self-respect that's the story of the fall pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well what's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light up and that's very quick I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light out because I put something together for them that's what mythological stories do so I'm not taking responsibility for that that's what the stories do so I say the story people go click click click you know in their eyes light up but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that it is unbelievable that's another thing that we're doing to men that's a very bad idea and to boys it's like you're pathological and oppressive it's like fine then why the hell am I going to play that's that if that's the situation if I get no credit for bearing responsibility it could bloody well be sure I'm not going to bear any but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you have you're not you're full of self-contempt and nihilism and and that's not good and so that's why I think all right that's what I think's going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction a man has to decide that he's going to do something he has to decide that yeah well you know partly what you're trying to do in the future authoring processes say okay well what's your highest value right it's the star it's like okay what are you aiming for you can decide man but you know there's some criteria it should be good for you it should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward maybe it should be good for you in a way that's also good for the family in the community it should cover the the domain of life I mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value but you but within those constraints you have the choice you have choice well the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the goddamn load so and they think well I won't carry any load it's like okay fine but then you're like the sled dog that doesn't have a sled to pull you're just gonna you're gonna tear pieces out of your own legs because you're bored you know you need people are pack animals they need they need to pull against a weight and and that's not true for everyone it's not true particularly say for low conscientious people I mean maybe they're open and creative or extroverted and some other things but for the for the typical person they they'll eat themselves they'll eat themselves up unless they have a load this is why there's such an opiate epidemic among dispossessed white middle-aged guys who are unemployed in the u.s. it's like they lose their job they're done right they despise themselves they develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates it's like that's what we're doing so yeah that's what it looks like to me is you you have to and it's so interesting to watch the young man when you talk to them about responsibility there's a god damn thrilled about it it just blows me away it's like really that's what's that's the counterculture grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh I'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it's like rights rights rights rights Jesus it's it's it's appalling it's it's and and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to to listen to these sorts of things - they're they've had enough of that so and they better have because it it's a non-productive mode of being responsibility man that's where the meaning in life is so all right good one more class they will see you next week
