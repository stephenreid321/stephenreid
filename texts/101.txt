until recently the New Atheists like Richard Dawkins and sam Harris had a firm grip on the cultural conversation the rise of Jordan Peterson and his deep explanation of religious belief have thrown a spanner in the works he's now doing a series of high-profile talks with prominent atheists like Sam Harris and recently Matt Dillahunty Rupert Sheldrake is a rebel a spiritual scientist who's been having these debates for a long time what does he make of it when did you first become aware of of Jordan Peterson and what what was your initial reaction I think I first became aware when people started telling me you know here's this guy who's suddenly burst onto the public scene and check out some of his youtubes I looked at some of them and I was actually very surprised hear somebody talking in a very sophisticated intelligent way who seems to be prayer God which is very unusual in these days and knew a lot about you and was clearly an intellectual and clearly able to stand up for himself in conversation with people with different points of view so I was impressed here's somebody who's really raising the level of public debate he seems to be arguing for very similar things to the conversations that you've probably been having for a good few decades now particularly the reality of religious experience and the irreducibility of it to a sort of materialist paradigm would you say that was why you connected with him well I think I connected with him to start with because he was first of all taking the Christian story seriously normally people who are interested in spirituality it's sort of Buddhism lights or shamanism or something like that I mean it usually follows the principle ABC anything but Christian and he was rather unfashionably talking about bible stories and in a very interesting way and taking seriously spiritual experience I mean it wouldn't be true to say that materialists don't necessarily take it seriously I mean Sam Harris after all as a meditator and so as Susan Blackmore and they're both committed atheists so there are quite a lot of people who now practice spiritual practices as the theme of my most recent book science and spiritual practices who would argue that what's going on is all inside the brain and I don't agree with that but the nevertheless there are some materialists and atheists who do agree that spiritual practices work and confer important experiences but without connecting it to any religious tradition how do we have these conversations because it just seemed like I mean there was the Matt Dillahunty and Petersen bit Petersen was also going to be talking to Sam Harris later in the year and I imagine they'll have a similar conversation about the origins of these right Sam Harris will say something like you don't need God to give you these rights they're just rationally obvious is there any way of having that conversation or are we just doomed to talk past each other insofar as atheists have a polemical agenda to attack all religion and is dismiss it as being inferior product of feeble-mindedness delusory and so on I mean all the usual attitudes that one encounters among atheists then and if they think they're right and they've seen the truth and anyone who's religious is being deluded and they'll probably continue their evangelical mission to liberate the world from religion I mean it is it has this kind of evangelical zeal to it very often it certainly does in Sam Harris's case not all atheists are evangelical proselytizing atheists John Gray for example whose recent book seven types of atheism is enormously enlightening a he's an atheist but he's certainly not a new atheist or a secular humanist who's much more passive mystic and realistic atheist in my view and he also traces the history of this types of atheism were embodied say by the Marquis de Sade the Marquis de Sade invented sadism or at least after whom sadism is named was an atheist and he thought if the snake God anything can be permitted and the rule of nature is the strong dominate the weak so why not if there's near God and why not have sadistic practices where if you want to beat someone and kill them your own pleasure why not it's that kind of atheism you see is very different from secular humanism so there are different kinds of atheism that the modern kind is usually secular humanists and so I suppose that the key questions really and not so much the origins of morality am you know I think it's morality has origins in human social nature and all social organization as I said before is it involves cooperation between members of the group they have to be sanctions on people's or animals behavior if they want to remain part of the group so I don't think it necessarily depends on a divine sanction and I think it's perfectly natural and normal for human beings to look after their young and to fight to defend them I mean after all mother bears defend their cubs and you know all sorts of animals defend and protect their young and members of their group I think we're the particular form of morality that is the object this discussion comes in is where it goes beyond the social group is natural and normal for animals and humans to protect their young to be prepared to work hard to bring out their young is deeply instinctive to fight to protect them or their immediate social group where the human rights things becomes more interesting and where the Christian message becomes more radical is where it goes beyond your own group helping other groups that's not natural in most social groups you fight for your tribe you fight for the good of your family you help your kids and you help your relatives but why should you care about somebody from some other group who you traditionally been at enmity with or something you never heard of the other side of the world what business is it of yours the idea that you're connected with a consciousness far greater than your own and far greater than all of humanity and gives you some motive for reaching out beyond the obligations of family and social duties your in-group that's the bit where the mystical experience of a connection with something much greater than yourself gives a motive for this selfless behavior secular humanism you see which doesn't base it on that guy the love of God can transmit such the love of humanity because it turns humanity into God as it were love humanity but as a command it's on you ought to do well you know it's a kind of duty yes you ought to do this you ought to have this duty it's not as powerful persuasive or as effective as a mystical sense of connection which gives you much stronger motivation if you feel you really are connected to something deeper and greater than yourselves if you were giving advice to to Jordan Peterson going into the debate with Sam Harris for example what would you say would be the most fruitful lines of argument well I wouldn't presume to advise Jordan Peterson he's a much more skilled polemicist than I am and and he's had much more experience and in fact he seems to be on the road practically all the time so I wouldn't presume to advise him at all but my own approach with atheists and is is that to see look at what they believe because you see the normal stance is that atheists are on the attack normally you believe in God was as very silly idea has led to all these problems and people just become obsessed with violence to get their own dogmas across this hedgerow I mean all those usual polemics and think of the Inquisition think of the Wars of Religion think of Islamic terrorism and so forth I mean these are their usual points of view atheists normally put themselves in the position of the Inquisitor you know here all these people with silly beliefs here they are coming to it with reason and science on their side and turning the spotlight of skeptical reason on these beliefs which they think of as being completely devoid of evidence and then they get the religious people on the defensive that's the normal dynamics but atheists are not people who have no beliefs or who've risen above belief the great majority of them have a very strong belief system they believe in materialism the philosophy of materialism mechanistic materialism which they often think of is of the scientific worldview well the trouble with mechanistic materialism it's a philosophy not science and it is itself a dogmatic belief system as I show in my book the science solution called sunset free in the United States mechanistic materialism the official belief system of science and every atheist I've ever met has been a mechanistic materialist so there are some who are not well probably John Gray is not but most are they have a belief system that they think is science and is true and what they believe is true and what everyone else believes is just a belief but actually the mechanistic materialist worldview is based on ten central assumptions the first being that nature is mechanical works mushy as a machine not an organism in other words it's inanimate and purposeless and secondly that matter is unconscious that the whole universe is made of unconscious s'matter and therefore there's no place for God spirits or angels in nature because the whole of nature the Stars the galaxies outer space it's all unconscious matter well these are assumptions they're not facts and they're not proven by science and they're not tested by science even they're just taken for granted and in the 17th century the philosopher Rene Descartes defined matter as unconscious because he split the world up into unconscious matter and conscious spirit spirit consisted of God angels and human minds which he thought were immaterial outside time and space and matter was material inside time and space and unconscious he made this distinction in the 19th century this Cartesian dualism was overturned by materialists said well why bother with this untestable realm of God angels and and human spirit is everything's just matter so they scrubbed out the spirit pole of Cartesian dualism leaving the material pole as the only reality and say God and angels disappeared at one stroke from this worldview was one stroke of the pen they just defined a way but this is an assumption is not a proven fact and it's an assumption that Descartes made in connection with a dualistic model of reality which has then reduced collapse down to a monism and the result of that is that materialists and atheists are left with the problem of consciousness it ought not to exist in a universe which is totally unconscious if they define matter as unconscious then consciousness shouldn't exist anywhere yet we know it exists in human beings and that's why in the philosophy of mind it's called the hard problem the very existence of consciousness is the hard problem and so they then have to say well it somehow emerges from brains when they get complex enough but how can something emerge that something radically different from or they have to say it doesn't really exist some of them say it doesn't really exist it's an illusion but that doesn't explain it because illusion is itself a mode of consciousness it presupposes consciousness or some of them say it does exist it doesn't do anything it's an epiphenomenon of mental over the physical activity of the brain but the point is that the very existence of human consciousness is a massive problem for materialism and it's what's led to a whole burgeoning field of consciousness studies a tremendous debate about the nature of mind many materialists in our jumping ship and have become Pan psychist saying that well actually there must be some kind of mind even in the simplest forms of matter like electrons or atoms so it's not just in human brains it's throughout all nature there's a conscious side to nature well then that's no longer materialism in its old form it's something new so what is well I think the question I'd ask Sam Harris if I were discussing with himself is just how does he see and understand consciousness and according to his book waking up he actually admits he doesn't know he doesn't commit himself to a straightforward materialist position he says that's his default position but maybe there's more to it than that but he doesn't say what and that's the crucial thing in the whole debate because what makes materials and atheists different from everyone else is their belief that the whole universe is totally unconscious all legends are based on the idea that there are forms of consciousness beyond the human level that the universe comes forth from a conscious ground of being that there's a sort of underlying consciousness of the whole of nature and of the whole of the universe that our consciousness is part of a much larger system of consciousness all religions take that for granted even Buddhism which defines the ultimate state of being Nirvana as extinction or the void it's not the same as just material activities in the brain is a conscious state which is blissful but beyond normal definitions imitations and qualifications so I think that if one has a debate with an atheist where one takes for granted that their assumptions are correct that mechanistic materialism is a true view of reality as both as bound up with science then atheists will definitely win any argument based on that because they're taking the ultimate view of reality to be this materialist philosophy which excludes God and angels and then you have to add them on as kind of quirks of the human imagination or as phenomena inside human brains or if you have the idea of miracles and God working in nature you have to say well gods then it has to suspend the laws of nature and occasionally intervene these are all preposterous views that are very unconvincing and if a theist can force religious people into those kinds of views then clearly there's a more rational position so you have to reframe the debate yes I think you have to reframe the debate because it can't be taken for granted that mechanistic materialism is a true philosophy of nature it's a philosophy of nature it's a belief system it's a worldview so the atheists have a worldview not instead of not having a worldview and I think a real discussion would involve discussing their worldview as well as the religious worldview on a level playing field instead of putting in the atheist in in I mean Dillahunty has the typical sort of rather he's not a bad a son there's a kind of smugness about that she well we know will apply some skeptical thinking to this and you know you could benefit for a bit of skeptical thought I'm totally in favor of skeptical thinking in my own case I apply the skepticism to the assumptions of science itself I think radical skepticism is a very good thing what I don't like is partial skepticism where you take for granted your own beliefs and use this laser beam of skeptical thinking against everyone else's assuming your own are invulnerable I think it should be applied to all belief systems it's fascinating if you if you think about it as okay the materialist worldview can explain absolutely everything apart from what is experiencing everything that that's a huge hole if you reframe it like that then it just seems to the whole thing seems to collapse well of course it does and and and materialist world view as an idea it's in mines it's nothing it doesn't exist out there it doesn't exist as something you can find and crystallize in a test-tube it's purely intellectual it's and I I dare it exists only in Minds and so as a view of the universe it's not an objective view it exists only inside minds in fact only inside some modern human minds and it presupposes consciousness and for most materialists who think that physical realities the only reality they have to believe disbelieve in free will their mind is just the physical activity through physical causes and trance events inside their brains so how come they believe in materialism well it must be their brain that makes them do it so why should you or I believe in materialism just because their brains made them believe in it there you can't prove it's true if it's just something that your brains made you believe in and it's also I find another of Peterson's views very persuasive on this where he says you cannot play that game if you play that game in the world and you treat people as if they have no free will they get very angry with you so it's not a playable game no and I think it's self contradictory because Sam Harris who is a believer that there isn't in a free will I'm he's written a book about it and and Dennett too I mean they try and get rounded by saying we behave as if we've got free will or something like that but we don't really then his views are ones that he has no freedom to choose so undermines the entire basis for any discussion about truth there is no such thing as truth if it's just something you're my brain makes you do and our brains make us do it because they've been shaped by natural selection to do for long periods of time with social behavior and small hunter-gatherer groups and making stone axe heads and and studying the behavior of animals and plants they hunt or gather there's no reason to believe a brain that was shaped by those evolutionary forces over long periods as the evolutionary psychologists like to point out it should have the necessary capacity to understand distant galaxies or the Big Bang or the origins of time and space or the entire universe why should human brains evolved over such a limited period for such limited purposes have this ability and and if they do and if we think that we do have that ability then how do we know it's not evolution and if I have this materialist worldview and try and persuade you of it what right have I to try and persuade you of something my brains just made me do and why should you listen to me rather than anyone else it's self contradictory and also don't know if you agree with this but I also think that it's quite dangerous you have on one side the sort of dawkins types that are sort of saying we're the brights we're the intelligent ones or the all the religious people are not only wrong but dangerous in their beliefs and we hold up this idea of secular humanism and whereas I think most people listening to a very materialist worldview will put two and two together and say well as might as well just take what I can for myself I don't see a way out of like complete selfishness and I wonder what impact that has on the world those are the rampant materialism that we see in our culture and how much of it is being fed by these kind of anti spiritual worldviews well I think quite a lot of its fed by anti spiritual world views I mean after all in ordinary parlance people use the word materialistic to refer to people who like going to shopping mouths and buying lots of things who are obsessed with money I mean philosophically speaking is this doctrine that matters the only reality but the two are clearly and one can't pretend that in the past there were you know humans weren't greedy there were plenty of greedy people at all times but in past civilizations greed and avarice was seen as deadly sins not as admirable qualities that make the economy grow and say there were countervailing forces in traditional societies so I think that the main danger of materialism mr. tic gives people a false view of themselves and and the reality in which they live it's extremely isolating it trade treats individuals as nothing but they the activity of their brains the mind is what the brain does is a materialist slogan if I'm nothing but the activity of my brain and if societies are nothing but individuals interacting through enlightened self-interest or whatever enlightenment philosophy of it is I mean that's one of the basis of the enlightened self-interest idea I don't want you to steal my things you don't want people to steal your things so together we'll gang together and stop other people stealing things and this is one of dillahunt his points well that no doubt there's true up to a point but if it's just isolated individuals if there's no sense of connection to the universe to nature to the was lives under lay under nature the conscious ground of reality or God if there's no sense of any of those connections and if we live as materialist science tells us in a purposeless universe where we are here as a result of blind chance in mutations and unconscious natural selection forces then it's a pretty depressing worldview and the result of their series that in secular societies the endemic mental condition or mental problem is depression on a massive scale vast proportions of the population on antidepressant pills lots of suicide even among children it's a depressing worldview and I think it's and it can lead to this rampant destruction of the environment and now I think that is a kind of spin off from it but I wouldn't like it he doesn't chart the natural world and then why bother protecting it yes I mean I wouldn't like to say though that it's only atheists and materialists who do that I mean look at the United States it's much more religious than Europe and yet America leads the world in wasteful consumerism in fact it sets the kind of gold standard for the world in terms of wasteful consumerism and a lot of these people are actually religious believers so I wouldn't want to overstate the case but I think this there is something about the process and Reformation that disenchanted the world even before the scientific mechanistic revolution in the 17th century disenchanted further but the ground was already prepared by the Reformation which was on the whole my process of disenchantment of nature withdrawal of God from nature and a focus of religion into the relationship between humans and God leaving nature out of it whereas most traditional religions including Orthodox and Catholic Catholic forms of Christianity have included in a sacred place is sacred times you know festivals pilgrimages the sense that the natural world is a reflection of the Divine Being and and in Hinduism you have sacred animals and holy trees and all that kind of thing the Protestants who didn't want any of that they wanted to focus religion on humans and human relationship to God and that sense prepared the grounds for humanism there's excessive emphasis on humans so again I wouldn't like to say as all due to mechanistic science or materialism there are long historical currents that have been at work I listen to your talk with Mark Vernon about Jordan Peterson and you described him as obscure and I wondered what you what you meant by that and whether I agree or not I'm not sure he's evasive on the question is he a Christian isn't he a Christian I mean one of the things I liked about Delahunt is he did put out at YouTube about his discussion with Jordan Peters and afterwards you know if if he said Jordan Pearson are your question and do you believe in God he doesn't just say yes he's as well as the story and you've got to I mean it becomes a much more complicated thing which what does he believe is he a Christian isn't he and if he is a Christian does he actually go to church services or take the sacraments I mean all that is obscure he's talking about these religious issues but it's unclear as to his own position and practice I mean I can see why he doesn't won't say I believe in God cause for an atheist that presses a button they think they immediately know think they know what you think I mean I see that yeah and usually the God they don't believe in in my discussions a theist turns out to be a God I don't believe in either yeah I think I think it's more of he would describe himself as an existentialist so I think for him to say by act as if God exists it's probably as close as he come to saying I believe that God exists because he doesn't really I've seen him in other time say he doesn't really believe in belief belief is something you act out in the world belief belief is something that influences your actions and if it's not it's merely an intellectual conceit that is not that is ungrounded and he's he's also got that which he also links to the Catholic Church about this terror of intellectualism for its own sake because the intellect can go and create worlds that we then inhabit and they turn out to be missing something crucial all of these intellectual utopias seem to degenerate into into disco pious because they're missing something yes oh I agree with all that no problem with that and I think that believed just as a sort of system of I mean against the idea of religion as a system primarily of belief I don't think it is I think it's a question of practice just as he says and and ultimately the way you behave in the world and that's why my books called science and spiritual practices because I think that we have to start from practices which lead to experience and that is primarily about experience even for Christians who have a Creed which is about a belief system that's not what most practicing Christians are primarily about they don't work out their position in relation to the Creed and then start going to church they go to church because they take part in the sacraments the communion they like singing with other people as part of a community they're in a sacred place they observe the festivals it provides rites of passage and so on I mean it's a whole kind of mythic structure and pattern of meaning and so forth as well as a morality but it's not primarily about abstract intellectual beliefs and certainly agree with that but I think is the reason I find him obscure is that it's not I mean when you explain it it makes sense to me but you'd have to listen to hours of his video text work that out and I just haven't had the time to go into sort of Peterson Studies in the depth that some people have I suspect that you you too would find an awful lot to agree on from what I've I think so I mean I'd be very happy to meet you my admire him and I think what she's doing is great I hope that comes about Peterson is has got a couple of very high profile interviews with discussions with sam harris coming up and it seems that there is this huge interest at the moment in discussion of these deeper ideas and do you have some some hope or expectation that what we are seeing is some kind of revival of maybe a 21st century spirituality or at least consideration of these deeper questions on a much more widespread level I think there's already a great revival of spirituality going on I mean the enormous popular interest in meditation for example and yoga these are spiritual practices there's an enormous revival of pilgrimage going on in Europe and something like 300,000 people a year walked Santiago de Compostela in the 1980s less than a thousand so we're seeing a great growth in interest to world psychedelics I mean the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s makes it sons if it was something that happened then but there's more people taking psychedelics now than the well then and I think there but the pervasive influence on the culture is very great and for many people that opens up a great interest in spiritual realms and most people who've taken psychedelics usually think there's more going on than just chemical changes inside the brain and obviously that's part of it that's why these drugs work but they're pointing to something much more than just changes in the brain on the temporal lobes or something so I think there's already this big spiritual revival going on but I think it's what it hasn't done is is made contact with the Christian tradition with our indigenous religious traditions it's outside the Christian churches for the most part and involves the kind of diluted forms of Buddhism like secular Buddhism or sort of neo shamanism you know people who take ayahuasca in Peru and I'm you can now do a weekend course and become a certified Shaymin I mean is so these have all got rather diluted and so we've got a mishmash of different traditions but all of them I think we can learn from but I think the key thing what makes Peterson so interesting is the way it contacts the judeo-christian tradition and what makes atheists interesting in this debate is that their stance is almost entirely to do with the judeo-christian tradition it's a it's a in what John Gray says is basically a Christian heresy it's basically rooted in Christianity shares many of the same assumptions and is part of a wider Christian debate they don't like it when you point that out though well historically speaking they can't really deny it so I do think it's a very interesting period that we're in and and I think that some atheists like Susan Blackmore and Sam Harris who have taken up spiritual practices really where the cutting edge of this debate is at the moment old-school atheists like Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins who just dismissed the whole lot are not really part of what's going on that's an old intellectual polemic all stance is basically 19th century point of view that they're representing that doesn't take into account the psychedelic revolution the growth of yoga and meditation the opening to Eastern traditions the influence of the Dalai Lama and all that kind of thing do you sense that someone like sam harris is on more of a journey as more open-minded than Dawkins for example yes I think he's more open-minded than dawkins but he still got this extreme anger against anything to do religion and he treats religion with contempt and I think it's just bad manners for example in his book waking up where he's talking about meditation practices he said our job is is to steal the diamond of spiritual practice from the dunghill of religion now you know he's learned from an enlightened Tibetan master in the SOG chen tradition he's been initiated I find that incredibly disrespectful for someone who's a teacher as a mayor as a very deep and fundamental level to call what they believe a dung heap and and instead of saying we're going to learn from these traditions and give thanks to the people who've taught us that seems to me more appropriate than stealing and and and treating with contempt and the same with Alain de Botton in his book religion for atheists he's an atheist philosopher again he says we have to steal these practices from religion and invent a new kind of a sea of spirituality but why not just be more friendly and why be so hostile and so unnecessarily negative that's the limitation I see in it what's interesting reading a lot of the comments on some of the Bible lectures is there's a lot of people who say I used to be an atheist and now I finally have an appreciation for the religion and it's very easy to get the impression reading it that that's that's an overwhelming an overwhelming thing I I mean I wonder how how broad that phenomena is but it's certainly very interesting that for a long time at least as far as I can tell the the online world was a bastion of new that new atheism it was very cynical very skeptical and it's it seems that at least very interesting to me that there seems to be at least some move towards an appreciation of religion now yes I think most people who've been raised atheist I mean in Britain most people have been raised without any religion over 50% of the population now identify themselves as having no religion and many people have been raised by parents who had no religion or even grandparents so there's a a great deal of ignorance about the Christian tradition most people don't know much about it except what they've read in a theist polemics and for them Christian who is all about an incredible belief in a God whose outside nature and who somehow engineers the universe in the first place and then suppresses a start button a very implausible view of God which I certainly don't accept myself but they think that's what Christians believe and then they see it as a whole series of dogmas that people are terrified into believing by scheming priests and a fanaticism that leads to endless wars and bloodshed I mean these are the standard kinds of views that a lot of people have and they often see a Theo's and more secular humanism as that goes beyond all this and leaves all that baggage behind as a kind of liberation and I think for some people it is a liberation but for people who've never known about the Christian tradition they don't know that the idea of God and the Christian tradition is not some being sitting on a cloud with the white beard no one's ever believed that it's the doctrine of the Holy Trinity a much more sophisticated and interesting view of the nature of ultimate consciousness so I think that talking about the Bible stories as petersen does is very illuminating for a lot of people because they they've never heard them before if they have they haven't seen that these could be interesting illuminating informative and contain psychological truths as well as religious truths and it also you see a lot of comments saying how naive a lot of the the sort of simple materialism of the New Atheists is against such a nuanced and literary and mythological appreciation of religion yes no a lot of atheism is extremely naive and is is based on a few clichés and a kind of emotional rejection of everything to do is religion I mean some is more sophisticated obviously and there are some people who have a deeper understanding and there are some people who become atheists having had a thorough grounding in Christianity or Judaism it's an interesting fact that of all religions Christianity is the one that most easily leads to atheism most atheists in the world today are from Christian backgrounds you don't often meet Muslim atheists or Hindu ACS or Buddhists atheists and you meet Buddhists who claim that viii Buddhism itself is atheistic I mean it's a arguable case but arguably though as John Gray as a philosopher John Gray argues that atheism in its most common forms is actually very similar to Christianity it's a kind of religion in itself it's it's mainly brought about by taking over the framework of morality of Christianity which becomes the morality of secular humanism and taking over the Christian view of God but instead of believing in God believing in humanity so humanity becomes a substitute for God and many of the things that were worshiped about God are now worshiped about humans this is something that you've all now Harare brings out very clearly in his best-selling books in homo deus he makes it very clear that the modern world is dominated by this religion of humanity which has its good points as well as it's bad points one of his good points is the emphasis on human rights which derives from the judeo-christian tradition the idea that everybody is equal in the sight of God gives rise alternately to the idea of human rights ancient civilisations didn't have that idea ancient Greeks and Romans were slave owners and so were Jews and in the Old Testament and indeed many questions were in the 18th century you know the slave trade and the slave plantations in the Caribbean and in United what's now the United States were mainly run by believing Christians on the other hand the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery was also driven by Christians largely Protestants noticeably Quakers so anyway this human rights thing which is so big in the modern world is grounded in this tradition and takes over these assumptions from Christianity if they were challenged it would be hard I think for many humanists to defend them because they were part from saying we think people ought to behave as therefore everyone has equal value etc you could easily I think have a reaction against this liberal attitude and say well why should we treat everyone as equal and people never used to in India there was a whole religion based on a caste system which didn't treat everyone as of equal value is not part of human nature to treat everyone as equal value this is interesting because this is a point that Petersen recently got hung up with Matt Dillahunty on where he was trying to say the ethic you think is derived from rationality is actually coming from a far deeper place yes Dillahunty I mean I studied the whole integer interchange in detail but Dillahunty basically goes off on the standard humanist thing that you don't need God to have morality which I agree with you don't need you can have moral systems without God and indeed arguably animal societies which are all all social animals have societies based on mutual help and interdependence that's what makes them social animals and they don't believe in God in any recognizable form to us so I think that where Dillahunty is wrong and where I think a lot of secular humanists are wrong is that they trace this value to the Enlightenment they think the Enlightenment is the source of the sense that all humans are of equal value well I think it isn't it isn't I mean the chief Enlightenment figures the greatest of them all in France was Voltaire Voltaire was a tremendous racist he thought that you know that Africans were an inferior species he was extremely anti-semitic and the founders of the United States and the Declaration of Independence which if you like Thomas Jefferson were slave owners so they believed in equal rights but only for people like themselves sort of white English stock he didn't think it applied to black slaves from Africa so I think that if you go back to the Enlightenment it's not at all obvious that enlightenment values favored equality of humans and they traced their inspiration to ancient Greece and ancient Greece was a slave owning society so it's a much more complex picture as to how the concept of universal human rights arose and a great deal of it comes from not from secular humanism but from Christian humanism and the sense that humans have divine nature what part of the Christian tradition is is especially in the Eastern Orthodox churches to do with the process of deification Jesus was a human being who became filled with God became a divine and opened the way for all other humans to become divine and in a way the religion of humanism secular humanism it takes this divinity of humanity as its starting point and that's exactly what you've are now Harare brings out so clearly he's an atheist so it's not as if he's arguing from this point of view as a polemical argument against secular humanism he's not he is himself an atheist but the religion of humanity is makes very little sense without this kind of divinization background because why should human life be especially sacred why not all life I mean the Buddhists after all say all sentient beings the Tibetan Buddhist so why should it be such good thing for humans to be totally sacred and every human life to be cherished well we can have battery chickens raised in their billions and in appalling conditions this is interesting as well because this is another point that we saw Dillahunty and Peterson get caught up on Peterson was kind of scientist hunter you are a Christian or you are you do accept the judeo-christian worldview you just don't accept that you do and you could see the argument degenerate because the last thing that he wants to accept is you're you're actually a Christian pretending not to be it just feels like a very difficult conversation to have if if what you're actually saying is you you have an entire lived morality an inherited morality that you that means that you're actually living out these values that you don't you say you don't believe it's a very it's a very sort of triggering thing for for an atheist to be told oh I don't tell atheist that they're basically Christians I doing they are but I think that as if you look at the historical roots of human rights which after all any became a kind of standard liberal trope in the 20th century I mean it's not as if people always had this fear as I say at the Enlightenment itself the Enlightenment intellectuals are racist and slave owners for the most part and it wasn't really until the 19th century of this idea of human rights began to take root but for much of the 19th century under the influence of Darwinism in the later 19th century the view was that there are superior races and inferior races and natural selection favors the white races that's why they dominate the world and that's the way it should be because this is Darwinian and it's based on science that was the standard view and it was taken for granted by the imperial powers most people in them that the white man's burden was to civilize the rest of the world through a superior civilization and so their slavery itself didn't exist after well it still exists but I mean the slave trade came to an end by the and then in the British Empire of decades before it did in the United States the stronghold of Liberty and the Declaration of Independence so I would serve right up until the early 20th century the idea of really quality of human nature wasn't a widespread belief in any culture I've seen the comparison made quite a few times online between Jordan Peterson and Terence Mckenna quite a few people saying not since they first heard Terence Mckenna have they been just devouring someone's output so much and finding it quite hypnotic and compelling and just reframing their their view of the world obviously you know you knew Terence very very well is that a comparison that lands with you not really I mean both of them have a and of gift of being able to speak and think on their feet is it well I mean Terence had a bardic poetic gift much more so than Jordan Peterson I mean Jordan Peterson gives the impression of someone who's struggling to find the truth and it's as if you actually see the struggle while it might be Leah sort of like that you see someone honest struggle to find the truth now Terence wasn't like that at all Terence had this kind of bardic poetic gift and there's just magical language flowed from his tongue taking one or two his sort of enchanted realms of the imagination you know whereas whereas Jordan Peterson say well Young's got these archetypes and we got these things hearing he talks about the imagination Terence was actually living in it and partly because he'd spent so much time in psychedelic realms which in in exploring realms of the imagination and also chance wasn't really a polemicist he wasn't trying to make a point or score points I mean he was trying to give a new view of human evolution that consciousness had evolved partly through psychedelic experiences that when people discovered psychedelics in some cultures a long time ago it must have shaped the way they saw the world I think that's a very plausible point of view I think he overstated it because I don't think all cultures were shaped by psychedelics some might have been where as jordan peterson is more polemical and political I mean he rose to prominence through arguments about gender and the serve compulsory you know gender politics in university settings and he does talk an awful lot about psychedelics John Peterson but he there's a whole lecture where he uses it to talk about the irreducibility of the religious experience I see well I haven't heard that talks I don't know he talks about psychedelics an awful lot as being one of the primary if you accumulate all of the the reports of mystical experience that they're one of the most reliable ways of inducing mystical experience and we don't understand them at all he says they are completely inexplicable within our current paradigm I see well then that might bring him closer to Terence but as a style of speaking and as a you know the way he operates I don't think it's very similar they may overlap in some of the subject matter yeah Terence just wasn't involved in I mean he gave talks in the kind of underground world of people who are interested in psychedelics at places like the Esalen Institute and he was on I was once with him on a radio show in Los Angeles and he is called KPFK which he was on the slot that ran from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. and and and in that slot he said you know most of the people who listen to me are insomniacs and you can say anything at that time of night so it was very much the kind of underground sort of outlaw Robin Hood type image that he had whereas Jordan Peterson is engaged in mainstream polemics with mainstream figures are in a very very public arena Michelle Wright thank you
