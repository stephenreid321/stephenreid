[Music] so Hana you put together a film called from women to men and it's gone pretty viral online it's had we think over about a million views lots of polarized reactions and you're as you say in the film what you want is to start a new conversation between women and men and in the film it's a you and a lot of other women including ile am owning parts of themselves that they're not they're not proud of the female shadow and it's created a really polarized reaction but as as you say in the film you want to start a new conversation between women and men so hopefully we can start that happening now but I'd love to hear a bit more about your background and what you hope to achieve through the film what what you want that conversation to look like so I'm working in conflict resolution since more than 10 years and mediating huge conflicts on various levels it's always the experiences always that our concepts we are so used to thinking of either I'm right or you are right either I'm the victim or I'm the perpetrator either I'm wrong or you're wrong either it's my fault or it's you fault that they're never true and that they are never leading anywhere I just realized that it's as true what is true for any every conflict is just true for the wounding between men and women and in the gender war as well and I'm really dreaming of a new step and a new dialogue at the cultural level it feels like we're in a really dysfunctional relationship between men and women and that I guess is what kind of where the film came from and also what we're trying to achieve through this dialogue as well so to me it's very interesting to analyze the wound between men and women because I think had some special insights into years of prostitution ten years ago in my life and when I started writing a book about it like just one year ago I realized I'm not the victim and I not the aggressor I'm both roads as a prostitute and I think prostitute is mainly seen as the victim and the client of prostitute is mainly seen as an aggressor and when I started writing about the clients sexuality as I remember it I felt we have not address us they are not the winners and no client on earth feels like a winner they are sufferer they suffering so deeply and are helpless and overwhelmed and like also victims and I think by writing this I somehow surprised myself and then Hanif wrote to me in email because she read this book when I think your script just just came out of your inspiration and I think then we had these perilous and fear felt this is a new aspect or dynamics between the sexes that is as needed as me too and then I think due to this book and the parallel to the film we got close with each other very soon and I was reading the script and feeling whoa after all the trailer doing stuff that I'd written this is really challenging and this is really taboo and then I need a time to digest and also I had an immediately immediate yes at the same time I didn't want to push myself over my limits because I felt it's not about my shadow was gone when I participate in the film it's whoa I'm more deeply connected with my shadow it's still there and so I I was I was happy about the time between getting to know the script and participating in the film because it was already a huge healing journey for me and it went on after the film I'm so so grateful and touched by this invitation I think because it really opens another aspect of an interesting and lively dialogue instead of something where we have to say are we the good ones or the bad ones and it seems as if collectively I don't know some something is ready that things show up now and in the meat too we can see that really the female wounding has up I said look what happens we've talked about this obviously quite a few times before and what I'm really fascinated about is that your your background seems to kind of mirror a lot of the dynamics that we're seeing now that it kind of goes back to the 70s the first kind of move the first kind of eruption of the women's movement I'll let you kind of tell the story but it's a really interesting kind of life story in experience I come from a different generation I was living in Berkeley and Berkeley was also simultaneously going through the very first first appearance of a really strong women's movement was probably the place where it was coming forth the strongest and that was really challenging you know also like because I never thought about objectifying women or any of the things that was just how it was you know and then suddenly there was like thousands of women in Berkeley who were coming together in getting very angry and I was just lost with the whole thing but fortunately there was also the kind of cutting edge of new therapies and in her work that was happening and out of desperation and necessity I found myself in my very first group which happened to be a men's group immense encounter bioenergetic group and what's in about 20 minutes because it tossed me into the middle of the room and started provoking me because I had no access to my anger and that was what was driving me crazy and I got him both with living together with a group of men who identified themselves we identified ourselves as feminists it was we were so we and we created a min Center and we had a men's radio talk show to talk about men's issues but and there were all in response to the challenges that were coming from the feminists and basically literally we were caught with our pants down feeling very guilty and apologetic and castrated like we're wrong and I remember one day in in a meeting just not connecting with the words everybody was saying and having this kind of almost like out-of-body experience in a way where I felt like I could just see all of us men and I had this vision that we were all sitting there sawing off our balls and I was like shocked by it and I was like and I realized in that moment that it wasn't going to it wasn't going to free me you know and I about after seeing it no woman pardon nor the women that it wasn't an answer and I didn't feel all of a sudden I felt separate from that group that I felt very connected to and about 15 minutes later I stood up and resigned from the group and I just said there's something going on here and I didn't name it as castration I didn't understand that really even at that time I didn't name it as guilt but I saw it as guilt and I saw it being turned everybody was turning against themselves were so wrong we're so bad and I got up and I walked out and I went out to dinner with my mother and I can't became so interested in this subject or the healing of Matt of the masculine and the healing of the feminine that I became a therapist and it became one of the main subjects that I specialized in and I still lead workshops and trainings with that and it's so so it's the works I have a big passion for and even so after all those years your words were like something I hadn't before or even allowed myself to actually conceive of so it was also a kind of waking up moment for me and and then was me too coming out and feeling that anger coming out and having my own history of realizing how my empowerment came by really getting in touch with my anger and letting it come out there was a big Bravo yes you know about it and at the same time I think that we need to come out of the blame culture you know and we need to come into the responsible culture and just a little bit of time that we spent together in the way that we've been talking and everything just feels like yes this is the real conversation between men and women hasn't happened yet and I hope that as part of our learning where we're learning from each other as we talk and that we're still in that and I don't want to posture myself as somebody who has all the answers I don't it's still it's still a process of Revelation and learning it's so interesting I just need to catch that need to stop the blaming and when I was listening to your story I immediately thought yes and also the safe blaming we need to stop the blaming over there and also the safe self blaming and in your story you shared how what you've been experiencing in this man groups group back then was not so much okay did we take responsibility for our shadow it was self blaming and going into guilt and that's what we women can do very well as well and I know that some women out there who have seen the film are afraid that that's what we were doing another round of self blaming okay now it's not blaming now itself blaming and it's not we don't have a Hydra of saying sorry for what happened out of a place of greatness we always learn how to apologize from a place of smallness and small people won't save the earth they won't be happy they won't contribute to anything I have to have this incredible courage of loving myself with all those shadows yeah and it's when we stop out of this thing of guilt and fault and go into just taking responsibility that I start to be curious about the conversation yeah it's interesting there's a there's a big phrase that became quite popular in the 60s through the through the women's movement was the personal is political and what's really interesting is your film is very personal very very personal but it's also putting a finger on one of the kind of the real source points on the culture especially coming so soon after me to the site have kind of so many women owning their stuff even I I have to admit when I watched the film when I watched the poem first time you delivered it I was immensely touched by it and I have felt touched by it when I've watched it but I've also watched it and felt wow this is so countercultural for want of a better word it's so opposite to the narrative that that we're in as a culture right now that I've that I've also felt wow it's unbalanced and I do feel that it's unbalanced in some way because it has to be matched by a similar ownership from the other side certain parts of the media I would say at the moment of very have a very ideological perspective a very sort of feminist ideological perspective and online there is a kind of growing anti feminist movement I know sort of you saw with some of the comments on YouTube especially and there is a growing kind of they call the manosphere online and there's a sense of any any sign of men kind of owning their stuff is seen as apologetic it's seen as and it can be kind of if it's done from a place of guilt it can be this sort of self castration it can be this kind of self negation and I think what's interesting is can you have ownership of how we are contributing to the division between men and women without slipping into self-hatred without so into castration without slipping into apologetic I think that's something that I find yet that that rebalances the the film kind of the ownership of a vast off as men I think it is very possible I think rather than you know going together can be these self revelation and revelation we expands you and makes you happy and and as you pointed out anything it is empowering you know it's like my shadow will play out negatively as long as I try to keep it in the closet and it will distort my life it will bring unhappiness to me and it will bring unhappiness to the people around me and it will perpetuate the need then to blame other people for the consequences of the ways that they played out so to me it's very obvious truth it's still a difficult one because the shadow is in the shadow it means it's hidden it means it's not the parent it's not totally obvious you know and I don't know if when it ends you know and when the win the self-discovery process ends but you know it's it's been with me for quite a while that understanding that I need to own my things and I certainly lived out a with women things which I feel shamed for and I feel apology for but I have an understanding about right now and I'm compassionate towards myself I didn't get taught I didn't learn how to be with women I didn't learn how to be what what how to deal with this strong sexuality that I had I didn't and I grew out of a culture that did objectify women and I came into certain positions of power where it was very well I was desirable man and I could have the women that I wanted and there were times when you know I abused that I lied i minimized you know I didn't on one hand I've been like this kind of responsible kind of growth aware guy and everything but to do it so I can cover myself look kind of like politically spiritually correct but I can still tell a story in a certain way that indicates more availability then I actually had and I see myself do that a lot of times because I wanted to go to bed with somebody and and and so but I said all the right things you know but it didn't you know and there was still a taking advantage of in some way and it and it hurt people and I said you know I that and I tried and it's it's almost like my brain is conditioned in a certain way to try to get what I want and to tell the story that I think will work the best to get what I want and sometimes it comes out of my mouth in a way that's not really totally straight and you know so that that lying to women within and in some relationship to sex having sex telling what happened to a partner when I come back the the changing of that has been part of my character for a long time it's something I just have to continue to own and every time I do is such a relaxation because the lie doesn't really create contact the real contact that I want there's always a sensing somewhere that something's a little bit off and want to just come clean with it you know you know what I have to tell you something I was lying this is the truth this is what I did or this is what I thought this was my intention everybody relaxes in the truth and everybody stays a little suspicious and pulled back in the lie and you know I like this thing can be able to look straight into the camera over there and say I have finished with this and I can't that would be a lie I don't know I don't know that I am you know I might have my lust mite over well me at some moment and I might use very sophisticated seduction skills that I have to you know lure somebody in for my gratification knowing full well that I don't I'm not going to be with that person and what I love so much besides many aspects of your story is it takes so much time so many centuries so men who want to learn how to clear their stuff really clear it and I think they have this ambition of I want to be really a cleaned up guy and that's so great okay then you deserve a few centuries of studying it every day of your life and you know what it's not the women who are worth it who are going to sleep with you are worth it you're doing it for yourself yeah and I think this is a very big key that especially men in our fast food culture don't learn they deserve time for learning because this is deep stuff it's not something that I can buy it's not something that anybody learned to perform in and it's not their guilt that I have to unravel the stuff and I think then and this is when you say it like a few minutes before I want to apologize and it reached me what me reached is something so touching because I experienced it so so little from men in our days they say sorry and they don't need me they don't need my reaction they are with themselves they are with their balls there were some boundaries they are not something that I can fall into with you as sorry so I can get what I want it touches me so deeply and this is not because you learned it yesterday but because you started studying at 40 years ago and I just want to say thank you for that because what I experienced in my nervous system and I would add to personal is political personal is collective what I experienced is something that really matters to me and I think this is something that I might say to many women in the collective thank you something more that I could feel I could feel the relaxation in my nervous system when you were just saying that's the truth and in allowing yourself to say I cannot say into the camera that is all heal now I'm clean now I'm continuously doing this work and owning and trying to be as honest as I can gives me the allowance to be allowed to learn to and I want to learn to be more and more and more clear with my truth and my boundaries instead of going into the seduction and manipulation games we have learned and I cannot promise that I will do in every moment and I will not step back into it in moments and thus I do understand a Stan man's mistrust I do understand that it's not easy to trust as women I do understand and I even can't say me honestly me you can trust always I can't I can't sometimes I can't even trust myself and I think it's really important that we acknowledge that it's part of a learning curve and you can't see further ahead of the learning curve than where you are right now but that you recognize the history of it and who knows what the next challenges are going to be one thing I definitely realize is that in the moment where we just decide and commit both to wanting to learn owning that we make mistakes that we fall back and that we are curious about finding out what it is what what is acting out what are we doing when I feel that both sides are curious about it then I I start to become really alive and really interested and really interested in the relation and really interested in the dialogue in the conversation it's interesting comparing two to you like we're from different generations yeah and I was raised by a very feminist family by a feminist mother a FEMINIST father and my I think the way that that that I've behaved in relationships has been much more holding myself back and the lying has been a kind of lie of omission all the time it's been not fully showing up not fully telling the truth not kind of taking on this kind of feeling of I'm completely responsible for the way that my partner feels so not being honest about the way I was feeling and stringing stringing women along of kind of internalizing this this feeling of I'm completely responsible for everything that they feel and then not really being honest and being in relationships for longer than I should be and not being honest about what I'm feeling so when I look at the me to movement and that it's a lot of kind of men the moments like men acting out and being sexually predatory I didn't experience that I don't think that was my stuff and I don't think that's a lot of guys from from my generation stuff and a lot of them were actually brought up in a different environment and a lot of it was feeling a sense of shame around themselves as men and not fully showing up for that reason at least that is something that I have started to experience and in my work with my client's etc etc that as I said in the beginning in the moment where I started to be interested in my shadow and when I started to feel more empowered and more loving towards myself I started to feel really compassion for the role I could see wow it has to be difficult to grow up as a boy and to become a man nowadays because the narrative of men are perpetrators men are violators men are abusers is so huge and out of good reasons of course it's the this does not come out of nothing but no man is born as a abuser and other aggressor and has a problem it oh it's a biological problem so yes and you get born and you'd grow up with these images of manhood and I think this is something that raffia talks about really well that if as a man you grow up feeling that you then suppress a lot of the kind of the natural aggression or the natural kind of feelings you you don't you you very much don't want to be like those other guys and actually that leads to a sort of shadow of perverted aggression so when we hear the word aggression and male aggression we think about men taking their gun or taking the penis and raping woman and I think these are perverted expressions of an aggression that the men had to suppress before it got into this form so even though our language is very it's it's very subtle what what we are looking for in the first place is an instinctual anger of protecting boundaries and that's for the sake of peace and for the sake of war between the sexes so yeah and that's so interesting the way you say that because what I work with a lot of times with men is that they they have rejected a side of their own masculinity like the roots of their investment because they want to be like anything but like all those guys who they see as responsible for the problems and so they and and they think that that's a level of aggression and violence and sexual abuse and so they repress that side and of course then it gets acted out it comes out and all kinds of things and a lot of times what I'm doing in groups with men is getting men to go in and really feel that layer of the masculine whether is the level of aggression and frustration and anger and hatred and encourage them to just allow it to come out and rather than that overwhelm their personality like they're afraid and then becoming that way they find that it's actually not that much it's like it's a lair but as long as you deny that lair you know you you lose your roots and you lose your instinctive connection to masculinity and into the truth that you could express in your sexuality you know and so that's a big part of flick the men's work I do is to get men to go into that culture creates the specific male shadow of aggression and it's like every shadow of the thing is this and it's healthy and it's good but a shadow is a monster and then you say you want me touching this monster no way you say honey trust me I'm doing this for 40 years it's worth it every time I do it and then you say hey come on I see I think every also with female rage I think this is not that big difference whenever I go really infrared and really enter and guide stay with my body I find myself to be the most peaceful being on earth the last thing that I plant I just plan to somehow survive this wave of rage and then wow I'm okay you okay it's quite a shock how positive it is to discharge suppressed aggression because this because this thing about the repressed or the repressed aggression which then as any any shadow does then plays out I think is actually the unspoken dynamic behind a lot of the me to stuff that we've seen because a lot it's come out that a lot of the people who were accused of acting out in ways during me to identify themselves as male feminists they identified themselves as not those kind of guys and if you identify yourself as I'm not that kind of guy then you're suppressing this thing and it comes out sideways and I think this is this is part of on a cultural level I think unless we realize this that actually we need to encourage men to embrace their masculinity to live that out to be in in a full way then they are discharging it they're not pushing it down into the cellar and then it comes out sideways and I think as a culture where we're actually probably going to encourage more of that kind of stuff because we're teaching men to be ashamed of their sexuality we're teaching men to be ashamed of their masculine aggression I think that's actually going to have the the the reverse effect to the one that we think and I want to add that when a group of men go through that and it's something I would try and bring in rather early in a men's group they come into a relaxation and like you said peacefulness and and this thing of male bonding becomes very real a support for each other and a love and a kindness and and and the almost the cessation of a certain kind of competition that is there when somebody feels castrated or when somebody is not empowered and they're always having to prove themselves and they come in as brothers and support and it's one of the most beautiful things that happens in men's group it isn't that they arrive okay this is home and I'm a I'm a beast I'm a rapist I'm a killer I'm I think it's quite the opposite they go oh god I feel so good and I love being a man and this and they can feel their legs and they can feel their balls and they can feel that kind of connection and it's a kind of simple healing in fact of all of a tremendous amount of what's been absorbed from the culture which is making masculinity so toxic and and I want to say that it that it's also right to really challenge the masculinity in the way that it acts out with the way that acts out when this when a man is castrated and when he hasn't owned as part of himself he really is a bit of a monster and I think the big misunderstanding collectively is that we mistake this expression of distorted castrated masculinity as masculinity so many when I listen to many feminist women not all of them of course many it sounds as if that was the essence of masculinity and thus we have to fight it and this is a huge misunderstanding because this is not natural masculinity these is already coming out of this castration of losing access to natural masculinity and also same as for for as women to you to to natural power I think both femininity I was so turned off of being a woman when I thought what the sky tree offers me as typical feminine it's it's the loser cut who who should want to have tits nobody on earth it's just being being the secondary class of human beings and so when I started to question is this right or am i right and have every right on earth to unravel my kind of femininity I became curious and I think this is so important for men truth they want to gain back their masculine essence and so they have to be curious about what comes up in themselves when they allow to set boundaries to this conditioning or the cultural imprint what masculinity means so it's almost like we need true words we need are we talking about this masculinity or the true masculinity of boy psychology and man psychology a lot of people divide it into that so a lot of what people are protesting against or attacking is boy psychology rather than man psychology it's not fully and in both cases I think like a real rite of passage at the time of life when were coming into puberty were you're welcomed into the feminine and into womanhood and you're the secrets and mysteries of it are revealed to you by elder women and the same for men my life would have been different God if I had if I had gotten the teaching in that way of what it what does it mean and I felt included and I felt the support I felt like a group of men or just even my father you know had my back come were there for me you know it would have changed everything you know I just I was so I really the amount of suffering and and pain and loss and being alone with it and just completely confused I would like to come back to what you have been sharing because I think it's really interesting you have been sharing that your personal experience is quite different in a different generation it has not been as much conditioning let's say of women are objects has more been you have to care for women from women's emotion for you are responsible or let's say guilty when a woman feels bad this kind of stuff and I imagine that this brings along a lot of holding back of own needs wishes whatever truthful and that this can bring a lot of rage to I'm curious I'm curious to hear about you is there right about that understand what what is your experience with that well yeah I don't know how much of that is particular to my upbringing because my mother was often depressed and I think a lot of children take on if they have a depressed parent that it's their fault so a lot of that could be tied in with it as well but I also know from the inner work that I've done and I know you've done a lot of inner work as well if you dig down it's almost universal that you have some kind of anger towards your parents you were in this kind of very you you you pretty much you all of your emotions you you kind of put onto your parents they were the world and they never they were they were there they weren't there and when they weren't there we all have this kind of infantile rage I think we all have on some level inside us and I think getting that out in some way is kind of an essential part of of getting more healthy as a as an adult but also going into that kind of inner work what I found really interesting was how much more difficult it is to identify the mother stuff than it is to identify the father stuff I often and I've seen it with other people in these kind of processes as well it's it's it's quite easy sometimes to see what my father did this my father did that he was there he wasn't there he was an alcoholic it was whatever and you can kind of quite easily identify and it seems much more easy to process whereas the mother stuff I found far more difficult to see I'm far more difficult to clear because a lot of the time it comes with these sort of feelings of what it would be so wrong to feel angry towards your mother it would be so bad to feel that towards your mother and I've I've seen yeah I certainly for myself I found it much more difficult to see you identify it and then to kind of work with it than with the father stuff you just touched something though that I think for myself personally and I see it with other men ties the story of the mother and lack of power and the men together and that has been this feeling that you're become very very sensitive to your mother's feelings and the changes of mood and whatever is happening in the house and it creates a kind of pleaser mentality in a way that's trying to damage control women and I've noticed in my relationships I carry that sensitivity it's like my mother was mostly really quite a bright and happy person but when she would go you'd feel the air change you know and there's something going on and then I I see myself getting activated in a way that I become a pleaser it's then what can I do in order and bit underneath it I'm trying to change her I'm trying to damage control the the emotional woman you know and and what it brings and I know it from my own experience and I see it mother thinks it brings out the contempt of the woman because the women hate because I become regressing to a boy in that moment I'm afraid basically of the feminine feelings and that may be some kind of negativity is gonna come up and so I start trying to find out what's wrong or make things right or please or go to my mind and try and talk to her talk some sense into her and damage control the whole thing but it's all motivated for by my discomfort of that situation and it's a it's a real challenge for me even today if I feel that my woman is going through something and to let her be you know and and not come in with oak and I you know start doing nice things for her or or trying to talk her out of her feelings yeah how can I fix it trying to fix a woman you know and and it and it's a sure thing to bring out the woman sword that wants to you know whack my balls off you know because they I think because I don't think a woman wants a boy and so to really investigate that whole part you know of the fear of women's emotions and the fear and and risk a woman's rejection and anger is a big step in growing up to being a man and I and it's it's a scary one to risk the woman's anger you know and rejection and if but if we don't we become pleasers and we're not really present then as the men and we're not really there and then and then totally totally and it's the register ends the right yeah you can manipulate it and you can castrate and reject usually we do both usually we do both usually we do both first women manipulated and then wicked yeah and so for me it's a real and that that's part of the complexity of the relationship of the mother because the mother was holding the basic energy of the house and of course I want to be in the loving happy merged relaxed space and when all of a sudden the vibe in the house starts to get tense and the chill comes in and then I know something bad is going to happen I know fights gonna erupt between my mother and my father maybe my father's late coming home from work which means he stopped off to have a drink which means my mom is really activated and it's gonna be a fight then I'm on alert my whole nervous system is is on alert then and I'm trying to damage control it and I've lost myself you know and it was a very real fear as a kid but I've somehow to confront that place as a man and see it and then say what I really feel you know instead of trying to manipulate because that's where the manipulation goes in and just come out and ask really straight hey what's going on right now you know and be there and be present and grounded in in in the mask on and recognize that something's happening and not be in trying to fix it or be in judgment of it but be actually really curious does that work Kirsten I'm really curious what's going on right now and it's so interesting for me it's so interesting to hear and to realize how this having learned that somehow manipulate the situation and the other person is the only way to damage control or to is mutual is because we as girls have learned that from our mother to maybe slightly different reasons I can for myself and I know this is true for many women I know that we have not learned from our mothers that a girl and a woman can have clear boundaries and say what she thinks and what she means and say no and stand up for what is right for me I have not learned that I had no role model for that it's always now trying to make it right for everyone else and in order to get it at least a little bit right for yourself to manipulate and it's always trying to find safety by going through the outer world and that's always the wrong first step I have to be safe with myself and I think this is also an insight where it's like it's really 10 deaths at the same time it's like somebody asks me what do you feel and I try to train it what does you want to hear how sick is that but how normal how collective how deeply am I not in touch with myself so I'm not out of touch with myself when my women gets a woman gets grumpy I've heard of touch with my life like all the time so this is something of where we really I think get humble and wise around how deeps wounding is and how big the gifts that we can get on this way because what I notice is that if I don't lose my ground and I don't go into the pleasing boy and I don't go into the damage controlling thing and I stay grounded in myself and I ask for granted plus hey what's going on I find women generally will go the sense that safety from the grounded Mexican and they'll go in their share very honestly and they'll tell me yeah no and it's really because in and it's the easy conversation and then rather than have a long complicated kind of thing that swims in the maresi swampy territory for a few days it's over in a couple minutes and again I feel in the kind of you asking what's going on that I won't be able to get you with my manipulation so I can stop my drama queen behavior right at this moment and to be honest it's a relief but I don't get this exit normally because you always going on like honey can I be a better person and then you stop crying and so it's so interesting around men with healthy boundaries it's it's a high way to connect a feeling it's the it's the paradoxes that by saying it's only when you're prepared to say something that might make someone dislike you or make a woman dislike you you make a woman reject you that you actually become safe enough to trust and it's it's as you've said it it's the growing up from a boy to a man being prepared to say something that might make a woman reject you and being grounded enough to be able to receive not happy reactions in the person yes yeah I think even retraction rejected of being the fear of being rejected from the woman is a fear of death because it's your mother rejecting you I think rejection itself isn't dangerous enough I think it's it's not something I'm not love but I'm threatened to death I think there's some sense it is an existential thing you really take it way way back yeah it manifests this is like rejection or so it's also that's maybe I'm the cause of it or and then you enter into a very complex relationship with a feminine in that whole thing whereas you as I said a minute ago and you confirm it it's actually very simple but also from an evolutionary level it's that women hold the key for men men's jeans to go into the next generation so being rejected by a woman is being rejected by its life by existence and on some level I think that's that's absolutely true I think that's the level of that's the level of existential terror that a lot of men have asking women out that in some sense they're standing in for the world they're standing in for nature they're standing in for existence itself so it's not just a male ego thing it's really an urgent instinctual threat of yes or no life or death I want to this something else that struck me recently as always thinking about your film Hannah is that and you also saw this with some of the reactions to it was quite a few especially on YouTube there were some reactions from guys who I'd say to the mug town men going their own way or men's rights activists saying too late ladies you you won't trick us again all of this really sort of toxic pretty misogynistic comments and there are online there are quite a lot of places that where talk about women degenerates into this very sort of toxic or very misogynistic very very suspicious very misogynistic place and what I found really interesting when I was thinking about your film is that because there is very little discussion of the female shadow in culture the only place that I think a lot of guys who've maybe been hurting relationships find it is on these websites so suddenly the only place that you ever hear anyone talking about while women are women can be manipulative women can be bitch's women can be like and behave badly if the only place that people find it is on these websites then what I think will happen is that people will then get more and more radicalized because on this websites it's not that women can behave like this it's women always behave like this women always will ditch you for a more more attractive man they will you can't trust what they say there's all of these kind of really yeah and it feels like you expressing both of you expressing the the fact of the female shadow and bringing that somehow more into the conversation is really essential to because otherwise the only place that you can find it is where the conversation goes toxic and making that conversation much more mainstream I think is essential really essential to to try and because otherwise it's it's really unbalanced yes and I was really surprised - honestly I discovered these men's rights movement and men going their own way thanks to the film and the reactions to the film I didn't know anything about it I had learned a lot about men's moon I had started to see how difficult it is also to grow up as a man in this society and in this world but I didn't know that there could be and of course I knew about devaluation of women by men but that there can be so much hurt and hate against women as you find it on these websites I didn't even know I was not aware of and it's shocking some way it's really shocking but it's also touching because it it shows how deep the wounding is and something that stroked me is that I I start to see a parallel and a parallel between where feminism has partly gone where me too has partly gun means turned into something toxic turned instead of standing up for our rights and our boundaries starting to fight all men collectively sitting in we are the victims we are the poor ones and you are all all the bad ones and it struck me to see that these men who write in that way in these internet pages etc are doing exactly the same they saying we men are the victims and all women are evil and now we have to fight the women instead of standing up and saying stop here I have a clear boundary because not all men are evil and we have our wounds we have experience we have had a lot of bad experiences that is great but but this going into a victim's hole and pointing the finger finger and fighting collectively the other sex I can see it on both sides and it's not going anywhere it's as Patrick's would work it would have worked already yes that's really like flipping it around it just changes the color of the same problem we won't get anywhere with the same metrics with the same thinking and yet and so but it's also true for both sides that I see the pain where it comes from I see I've seen it for a woman first to be honest but I see it there now too and I see many things they have gone through and I'm happy what you have pointed out that yes that this film might be one contribution I hope it's just the beginning of a new conversation a beginning of a contribution to offering space for having these conversations in the more mature way and in a more constructive way and I am actually touched by quite some feedbacks I get from man who have experienced very badly but have very bad experiences many wrote about their experience in divorce not being allowed to see their kids having been well even also I received letters of man saying I have been not not even only emotionally but also physically abused in my marriage I have stayed because I have two wonderful kids I have a lot of heavy experiences and I guess that a man going into these movements men going their own way many of them have these experiences and have never found a place to express their hurt and I'm I'm really touched and happy that thanks to this film man show up and write about this experiences without hatred but with hope they wrote thank you so much I hope again that woman maybe can even love me as a man I had I read this Miami it's touching it's wow and I guess my hope for this film and the subsequent work and the work that's happening anna frebel wisdom is that it will encourage healing and offer possibilities other than blame and victimhood and without judgment towards the people who've taken these very strong positions because we don't know what happened to them you know there they form their personalities the way that they did and they came to these beliefs out of real experiences and so there has to be a certain level of compassion but just to even get the possibility that is possible to have open honest conversations where people on their shadow side I know from my work with people is really a route towards healing now how quickly that is taken up or how broadly that is embraced remains to be seen you know but I that's why I respect so much the work that you're doing right now and going around and talking to all these people who I think really do want the healing to happen it really you want I mean how much richer better life be if we really can open up and talk and share and being how much more joyful and I mean it's just so obvious I want to repeat what you have been saying in the beginning I would love to invite everyone to start to to do these steps and not for the others me as a woman I am not doing it for you I'm really doing it for myself and you should do it for yourself and not for us because it's so freeing it is stepping out of a victim's place it's the best thing I could ever have done for myself that's the truth and my truth is my heart once to love and if I stay in the victims place stay in the blaming place I don't allow my heart to love and I suffer from it maybe you do but in the first place me I suffer from it
