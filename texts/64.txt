[Music] it seems we're in a very paradoxical time that in some ways you can look at many different kind of indicates and say this is the best time to be alive and yet at the same time you and a lot of other writers that I'm following have a real kind of apocalyptic tinge to their writing are those two things true at the same time that's a very good question let me see if I can puzzle it out so one of the metaphors that I've found is very helpful is the metaphor of a caterpillar voraciously devouring leaves so from the point of view of the caterpillar there is a the experience of becoming fatter and fatter and all things are going well it's good to be a fat caterpillar now from the point of view of the leaves things are going rather poorly and if you zoom back out you will look at it and say hmm there's a paradox that on the one hand has never been a better time to be a caterpillar and on the other hand I'm noticing that the leaves are getting ready to go away and so things are about to get very bad very quickly but then there's even deeper insight which is that caterpillars devour and just destroy everything around them in the process of endeavouring to become a butterfly and so I think that's actually the deeper notion that if you look at our civilization from the perspective of it is a caterpillar it is becoming more of what it is so it's flourishing on that basis it is rapidly consuming a substantial fraction of the environment that's necessary for it to continue being where it is and then this ends up in one of two possible states either it hits some kind of wall where some piece of that support structure fails in which case it just dies or it actually enters into this moment of metamorphosis and it transforms into another kind of being altogether I think that's the perspective that I bring I can't speak for anyone else what are the indicators that make you think that things are getting much worse than maybe they appear on the surface well I guess probably the most important is is the fact that I've been looking at this now for quite some time and so the models that I've been using to try to make sense of a number of different college of systems for now divergent pieces or characters because of the world have predicted a number of things that were at the time didn't seem to be reasonable let's go with like the Trump election this is kind of a very concrete one so the models predicted brexit the models predicted Trump or something along those lines not exactly the events of those characteristics or specific my specific models right and so I'm in some sense I'm kind of simple if I have models and the models are predictive and particularly when they're predictive in a way that is contra conventional wisdom I give those models more credence so I run lots of models I don't have like two or three I've got lots and lots of models and some of them have been increasingly accurately predicting circumstances and others have been less and so these have begun pay less attention to these and give more credence to these and as I watched these these are the ones that tell me that we're on a particular kind of trajectory and that trajectory has well it has characteristics that you can use to say okay here's what it looks like it has how it would play out and more importantly it actually has a very specific finite endpoint so that we're on the kind of trajectory that has an ending to it and that many of the metrics a minute of the phenomenon that we're witnessing in many different ways right now it's showing up very viscerally in terms of the way that culture and society are showing or feeling particularly the West are indicative of their of the fact that we're kind of far along the curve on this particular dynamic so that's the that's the way that I'm going about doing this and there's a lot of unfortunately into explaining that double-clicking on that is not easy I've actually spent some time critics and YouTube videos and some medium posts trying to actually take a particular set of concepts and like making them small enough to convey in a in a byte and I guess some of that's been successful but if we're talking about a curve and you're saying that we're far along this curve and it has an endpoint what what is the curve what is the endpoint well the reality is there's actually many many curves and they're not all of the same meaning that they're not they don't have the same basis and was the same causal structure behind them so I'll give you three one curve is called the Tainter curve the Tainter curve is was used by an anthropologist to try to figure out and describe why it was that complicated civilizations collapsed he actually called the collapse of complex civilizations but I have to modify that for four specific reasons and we can investigate if you'd like what this curve is and why it works and how it shows up but it has to do with the way that human beings design and reinforce the kinds of institutional structures that we use to meet our needs and there's a particular set of characteristics of how these structures become bound meaning they become those oils an example so in the beginning we use oil partial for kerosene by the way to light things up and as a secondary distillate we have gasoline we don't really use much gasoline and it's actually kind of easy to get you're in Pennsylvania and a little bit of effort you can get some oil out of the ground so then we begin to say repurpose gasoline in it being fuel for cars and so this increases the utility the value suppose expands the potential of our of our civilization so we kind of moved up this curve or our energy usage the amount of energy we have to spend to get the oil and convert into gasoline returns a substantial return on energy investment and so we do right so when it's up happiness two distinct things simultaneously one is we actually expand our underlying use of this energy source we build more cars and maybe because it makes it easier for us to grow food we grow more food then we have more people so we expand the base that uses it relies upon this capacity but at the same time we're also plucking the low-hanging fruit of access to the resource so it gets harder and we have to actually drill deeper wells or we have to frack to be able to pull out the kind of oil now what's interesting is that this is why I said it's complex this is not a simple thing it's actually the second order that matters because what we'll do is we'll say okay what's gotten harder so we'll invest in R&D so we'll get smarter so we we get more we get certain advancements in the underlying technical basis that we use to extract the resource so we have a curve on the technical basis but what ends up happening is is that as we're picking the low-hanging lowest hanging fruit at the resource level we're also picking the lowest hanging fruit at the R&D level - there's a certain period of time where our R&D is kicking ass we spend a million dollars on R&D will get massive advances but at a certain point in time that has what's known as an s-curve meaning that we've picked all the low-hanging fruit in innovation space we've figured out all the easy wins and now we're starting to have to work harder to get harder wins we figured out how to do drilling that goes diagonal and that was one really nice win and we got you got that one now we have to do fracking now I have to do whatever is next right so just gets harder and harder and harder so at a certain point what happens is is that we may have to spend a hundred million dollars to get a two percent increase in performance while simultaneously we're now really picking deep fruit so it's getting deeper and deeper and harder and more expensive to extract and in the meantime over on this side of the house we've built out an entire gigantic global infrastructure that absolutely is fully fundamentally dependent on gasoline from virtually everything like if your car stop tomorrow you couldn't get groceries all right so we've become more dependent on the resource we become we tap out the R&D site which in the beginning looks awesome we're getting massive gains until we've reached the end point and we've made it we've gotten to the end of the easy pickings and so things are getting harder and harder harder so what happens is we generate fragility we generate an environment where we're having to spend more and more energy either in terms of R&D or in terms of just absolute activity maintain where we are but it's actually getting harder and harder to hold and the consequences of falling back become worse and worse now this curve actually has one of their characteristic to it which is we're now way over our skis like it may have been that call it in nineteen twenty 1932 to shift and go from a gasoline economy to say an electricity economy and we don't get committed to cars but we've we've passed that fork in the road so all the different choices we could have made in the past and have become narrowed and narrowed and narratives we just have to double down more and more and more on this so we've actually kind of like become an addict we've come in dicted to a particular approach and just like an addict that approaches starting to give us diminishing returns and so that hits a wall and so that the Tainter curve in a nutshell and there's this can happen across particular domains so you might show oil an oil might show up in just the domain that I described which was technology resource and economy but you might also see how it shows up in geopolitics and it may be that we have to actually go out and say use our military to sustain the Saudi regime not because we like them or think they're filling a lot but because they have oil and if we don't have oil our economy collapses right so now we're generating externalities in the environment and we're creating pollution and we're generating externalities in geopolitics which creates systemic fragility in other places the point is that as you're creating something which becomes more and more and more fragile with more and more and more impact you're setting yourself up for a for a bad situation and you can't back out of it elegantly right you're very much having to go forward and so it is if happening is is that rarely on some some very rare circumstances there's enough consciousness and enlightened choice making to be able to recognize that things are not working out and then we need to step back and shift and maybe that's happened two or three times in human history is a very rare thing most of the time what ends up happening is that we run smack into the wall particular because quite often the decision makers are in a position where they feel like they can actually insulate themselves from the negative consequences and so it's okay to run the hoi polloi into the wall because we're going to be ok what they don't realize is that they are actually sitting on top of the hoi polloi and it's all a seamless web and so it ends up happening is the elites basically drive us right off the cliff because they don't fully feel the consequences of the choices that they're making so that's the the Tainter curve another one which is reinforcing it is something I'm calling the Bryce Highsmith model I have the two individuals who explain it to me and and it works kind of like this you have a basically a series of phase transitions in game theory so in the beginning you have a group of individuals who are tightly coherent and are able to maintain their ability to do that or if you know how the prisoner's dilemma works but their ability to resolve the prisoner's dilemma by not defecting on each other now this happens due to very well functioning called justice mechanisms meaning people have a felt sense that if they defect they will have negative consequences so they they feel like they're playing a multiple version of the prisoner's dilemma game so that if they act badly the consequences will come back to them and so they choose to act well and that generates the global optimum which is better and so this group is is thrives right so you've got a group that's working well it can solve collective action problems effectively and so it happens is that it gross but it thrives I'm so gross it brings new people in or expands its population its own basis whoever it happens to be and so you might imagine let's just make a simple version the first version is an actual tribe so this is a tribe and it's relating to nature and what happens is that as it becomes successful the tribe expands and it expands and expands and expands until the mechanisms that it originally used to close the loop on justice to make sure that everybody took responsibility for not defecting become more and more attenuated until they're starting to open up little gaps some possibilities where I can maybe get away with something and it won't affect I won't have to bear the full cost or there's some reasonable probability that I won't have to bear the full cost so the game theory starts to shift so now you might imagine that the tribe was relating to nature but now the tribe has become the niche so will end up happening is little tiny crow tribes will begin to emerge who are actually figuring out ways that they can develop local selective advantage themselves on the body or on the surface of the nation of the of the society and so what ends up happening is it you know criminal gangs for example but also bureaucracies and bureaucrats any circumstance where I can begin to have a local selective advantage by playing a rule where from my perspective what I'm doing is not catastrophic and I'm playing a small win I'm not bringing down the whole freaking society all I'm doing is skimming a little bit off the top and the society doesn't have the capacity to enforce at a high enough level of probability and magnitude justice the loop coming back to me then game theory says that people will begin to play that game so the problem is is that as you begin to do that it begins to actually create a downward spiral meaning that well if you're cheating and I'm not then I'm losing and this is the classic is called a multipolar dilemma it's shows up in all kinds of different stories about collective action problems a classic example might be if we're all fishing from a shared fishing resource and if we all only fish a hundred fish the resource works great if we all fish a thousand fish the resource completely collapses but if you can get away with fishing 500 fish and I'm only fishing a hundred fish then the resource base survives and you win that's one that's one example there's many many examples as one of them the broader concept is a Multi multi polar trapper multipolar dilemma and it is ubiquitous like it just shows up that's what happens in the context where there are gaps emerging the ability to enforce justice and force closed loops in detection behaviors and so what ends up happening is is that the the body of the society continues to endure for a while because there's generativity involved in just lots of people working together in a culture to society but the cracks begin to form and as the cracks form it drives choice making meaning that the virtuous remember the Game of Thrones funny I'm sorry I have to have to invoke it the virtuous began to lose remember the the the Starks and the Lannisters the Starks live at the border they live at the border with nature they live to the to the wall where winter is so for them the the reinforcing mechanisms to keep those justice loops closed are pretty strong and so they obey the law intrinsically remember at the very beginning that was at Ned Stark the leader said like you have as the king you must enforce the law yourself and this is good justice go all the way to the center of Empire far away from the border where the the justice loops artists as the feedback loops aren't as stark now you aren't next necessarily going to be killed by winter if you're living in King's Landing so now the Lannisters down in King's Landing they are experts at playing the defection game they're experts at figuring out how to play the crack so you can't quite be certain that they're the ones who you over and so they can get a little bit of an extra win so if you're not playing the game remember that was the phrase in that poker game if you look around the poker table you don't know who the sucker is it's you that comes from this space so what ends up happening is that everybody begins to either be a sucker in which case they're the ones who get their heads cut off or they have to start being a player now of course as it's everyone becomes there's a self-reinforcing feedback loop at that point if you look around the table and literally everybody is looking for taking out the sucker except for you then you're screwed right then you're dead so now you enter into the final stage the final stage is what they call the fractal defection stage which is the defection starts to eat at the very fabric of what holds the society together and eventually the entire thing is in fact actually put into jeopardy you can't trust anyone you can't get anything done bureaucracy is hypertrophied you have to assume that every interaction is an interaction of multiple layers of manipulation coordination costs go through the roof and again the whole society collapses from the global optimum to the local optimum of prisoner's dilemma and boom you're done so that's another curve all right and so we've got two distinct curves and that seems like a process that's being sped up by an actor like Trump who is explicitly going from that perspective like one of one of trumps rules is you cannot trust anyone and so he's building that that narrative into the into the global system well I think there's two things first is I'm going to put an asterisk next to Trump which is to say that every quite quite often people tried to think that they understand him and so then they reify him into some sort of artifact that I certainly don't know him well enough to be able to say anything specifically about him so I can do this I can identify a particular character that has certain characteristics and so that's not a bad story there's certainly a Trump character who shows up with his characteristics you might say that he's the the embodiment of a particularly aggressive poker player who's happy to play chaos right and understands how to thrive in chaos and fundamentally is kind of peak predator of that fractal defection land that's just where he comes from and so for him it's intuitive and sensible that one behaves in this fashion and therefore it's very effective in this stage I mean it's you know the Lannisters out-compete the Starks until chaos actually happens right until winter actually comes it's actually better to be a Lannister than a stark in King's Landing and so but then yes it's the point that makes it accelerate the process you know again the it's actually sorry I think you may be pointed out something separate which is equally important if I am of that sort if I'm playing that kind of game it's in my interest so make sure the game is of that sort so I actually have an interest to break the justice links to make things more chaotic because I thrive in that niche I thrive in chaos I don't thrive in order in order I might in fact be called out and home from the nearest tree so I actually need to spin more chaos because that's where I thrive so yes you've got both my activities make more chaos but then even intentionally I have an invested interest in increasing the amount of chaos just because that's what I'm good at so that's an example of a second curve then we've got other curves let's take for example the the exponential technology curve one of the interesting characteristics about exponential curves is that they go to infinity as far as we know we don't have the ability to go to infinity in say processing power which means at some point they have to actually stop being exponential they have to be some kind of an s-curve or by the way just a straight draw so when we take a look at where we are on the x button on the technology curve we're getting into pretty significant Exponential's we're doing some very powerful things and one it is for sure the case that at some point in the not-too-distant future by that I might mean a hundred years or a thousand years we reach the end of that exponential all I have to do is sort of forward project Moore's law multiplied by the amount of BTUs per unit processing power and you get to the point where the computational energy on the planet generates enough entropy to evaporate the entire atmosphere for example or the atomic bound of quantum mechanics can't actually produce any more forward advancement so that's a curve that has a certain characteristic but let me talk about a variation of what happens in that context so let's go back to game theory so I have I'm playing I'm playing a game to win and you're playing a game to win and when does the way this game works is it's a zero-sum so if I win you lose if you win I lose so this shows up a lot right so if we're playing that kind of game is kind of a certain characteristic now in this game I have a strong incentive to become more effective because otherwise I will lose and you have a strong incentive to so one of us is going to be able to be more effective than the other one we're going to be the winner now if it's not a catastrophic win I mean if I don't extinguish it if I don't kill you if you're still in the game then you have a really strong incentive to be very exploratory and try to figure out some novel way to write around me and we see this happening for example in capitalism this is one of the virtues of capitalism it uses this mechanism to drive innovation yeah so if my company I'll competes your company your company the eyes are is going out of business or it has to be more innovative well what that does is that is what pushes us along the innovation curve so increases the exponential increases the rate of that exponential now all is well and good except for a couple of things one is as we're engaging in conflict with each other we're creating some set of externalities and we're producing some kind of waste energy into the system it might be that just the simple act of producing goods and services generates pollution and stuff like that or it may be that how I market my product into the marketplace creates a jams the sense-making systems the human beings used to figure out what a good choices for themselves it doesn't matter like fill in the blank there's some nonzero externality that is produced and you kind of multiply that by the power the magnitude of what we're doing so if what we're doing is gathering sticks to create fire that has one level of externality if what we're doing is nuclear power that has another level of externality it's much larger and potentially very significant well what moving along the exponential tech curve means is increasing our power so as we move further and further to up the curve which we have to because of the competitive dynamic one of the things that we intrinsically do is when increase the risks associated with the magnitude of power that we're playing with so for example very concretely right now we're in a situation where say CRISPR casts nine has taken the nightmares of germ and genetic warfare that were just nightmares in the 1970s like in the nineteen seventies we had this concern that we might engineer super viruses or we might engineer different kinds of super toxins and realistically only a handful of nation states had the technical capacity to do something like that and they were able to contain that well now with CRISPR cast nine in the next two decades or so a reasonably well-funded multinational corporation will have that capacity and in the decade after that and anything bagel deck exponential maybe a high school chemistry class will have that level of capacity well just stochastic risk means that somebody somewhere is gonna it up so we're talking about massive consequences could just cuz the magnitude of power and increasing fertility you know even a small deviation back in nineteen hundred the totality in all of humanity if we all made terrible choices really couldn't meaningfully threaten the species the worst war had ever fought had barely been a blip in population growth even World War two and all this ferocity was not meaningfully significant in the total survivability of the species click past the invention of the nuclear bomb and then the hydrogen bomb and then multipolar hydrogen bombs and suddenly we're in a situation where for the first time in the history of history we did in fact have the capacity to kill everybody or at least mostly everybody and in that case it only required that two people have permanently choose not to push a button at the same time to avoid that problem so we qualitatively shifted from one place where we couldn't possibly hurt ourselves to a place where we could but still it was a relatively easy thing to do and we barely made it and we barely made it past that threshold and now what's happening is that as removing that up that exponential curve the magnitude of power continues to increase becomes decentralized it gets pushed further and further out to more and more empowered groups smaller groups and therefore we're moving into a state where in the not-too-distant future effectively everybody is going to have to be enormous Lee wise and skillful to avoid creating catastrophic consequences so it's another curve and so the point is that we've got a lot of curves and we can actually take very small curves like the Hubble curve with with oil reserves we took a bigger curves like the Tainter curve the brightest Ida Smith model or we can look at a fundamental curve like this relationship between game theoretic rivalries dynamics and exponential technology and how that relates to fragility but all of these are kind of pointing in the same direction which is that there's something about the nature of how we do civilization now that is leading us to a circumstance where fragility is being built into the system in many many different layers and you've also talked about the the way that the dialogue is going the increased polarization of the dialogue is is that where we're staking out ideological positions that are very difficult for us to to communicate with the other side well this is both a cause and a symptom so let's take a look at it from the point of view of being a cause easy enough right if I in playing a political game to win then I am incentivized to generate a sent a set of signals stories that create a maximum intensity of separation between my group and other groups so long as microbes the biggest ice opponents of having to be the natural in a winner-take-all democracy where 51% wins everything there's a maximum incentive to generate a narrative that creates a strongly bound group and of course with this almost always implies is to create a strong and bound group that has a natural antipathy to some other set of groups we have a natural incentive to create strongly oppositional groups and then what happens is is that it'll sort of tend to orbit around 50% on either side because that's power shifts back and forth but then it will tend to polarize because that's just the natural dynamics that if I'm the more polar the guys in the middle end up getting dropped out because the binding agent of extreme threat is stronger than the binding agent of extreme reasonableness under most circumstances and this is not a logical law this is more of a human social associate political law but we've noticed this it actually happens all the time we see it happen all over the place and it's happening right now for sure we're in a level that I think we're these days I don't even have to speak about it theoretically most people I think are aware of the fact that there's a trend in their lived experience where the polarization of the language is increasing over time and it's self reinforcing I mean honestly like at this point in the u.s. UI there are what it was too bright we're putting us the most recent one ah so if you're on the right that means that you have blood on your hands because you support gun rights and therefore effectively have pulled the trigger on killing millions of people and simultaneously are effectively a interested in is fully supporting and directly engaging in genocide against immigrants and this is this is the level of the rhetoric right it's not level of rhetoric of I disagree with you on immigration policy level of rhetoric is that you are comparable to the worst things that have ever happened in human history because of your beliefs and of course the opinion is symmetric meaning that if you're on the Left you are a radical completely insane when is it liberalism is a mental illness completely insane authoritarian hell-bent on simultaneously engendering genocide against in this case white people and for sure unborn children of all races by the way so you're actually nihilistic in that sense it has to do with essentially kneel ISM essentially you are fundamentally designed to hurt and kill yourself and in the process of doing that you are doing it at the broader social level so it's really treason why is it going so worse now is it social media well again I think there's actually a number of different forces at play but let's focus on the last one that you just mentioned so one of the things that's not often enough contemplated and therefore worth talking about is the fact that we're we're in the middle of a major transition in media infrastructure and that has a lot of impact there's a lot of of consequences so the the legacy media infrastructure and by the way when I say media infrastructure I literally mean the way that as a group as a society we are able to collectively make sense of what's going on in the world and then inform ourselves about what choices to make so it used to be broadcast still is mostly but very much used to be only in my broadcast I mean something like some small group of individuals maybe even just one have authority to speak and everybody else says that has responsibilities of listening so whether that's a teacher at the head of a class or it's a newscaster broadcasting over television there's this relationship of small number of speakers large number of listeners and a sin and no inter communication right so even if I'm listening even ask questions I could just listen and as a modality of communication and of sense-making this has certain effectiveness if you do a very very good job of empowering the people to speak who speak then they're saying the right things and so you want the most competent most honest most clear-headed most thoughtful individuals to be empowered and with them to be credentialed you want some sort of mechanism to credential identify them you give them the speaker they speak and everybody else gets the best information that's actually not bad we can go into your like some into some depth on what the limitations of that approach are and and how it can actually end up being disrupted in highjacked which of course it has but but for the moment let's just say okay that's what it has been for a long time and this has implications for how individuals show up psychologically developmentally as a child we're very plastic and so as we're emerging we're looking around our environment trying to figure out well how do we what do we do how are we successful and if the way that you're successful is either you get really good at listening understanding what the right beliefs are and then executing on them effectively that's how you get rewarded you get the A+ on the test by doing it that way or you figure out how to climb the ladder on being credentials so you get to be the one to speak right that's what success looks like they met the kind of psychological model that you'll develop as a human most of the time unless something's wrong with you and you can't ride that elevator and so you end up with a self reinforcing system or the topology of the overall media constructs this dynamic and then the developmental psychology constructs people who are adapted to that environment so they reinforce it on themselves now you shift obviously for the past 20 years in an accelerating curve we've been moving into a completely different kind of media topology that a peer-to-peer network and the Internet behaves completely differently no longer has this model where by physical nature a small number are the only ones who can speak and everyone else must listening cannot communicate back has a completely different nature it's more like our conversation I speak in this case more you speak to the right needle to ask questions you can direct the conversation we're actually in a conversation and so this is a different typologies different relationship with power and it also requires a different adaptive behavior right so we can maybe get into that in a bit and what that looks like but the thing that you're calling at is the fact we're in the middle we're in a spot where the old structure still largely controls most psychologies and most the primary institutions of power what you've cooled what I've called the blue shirts exactly the new structure is emergent right it's coming up from the bottom it's happening all over the place and they're struggling it's just of conflict it's a conflict at the level of sense making it's a conflict of at the level of what kind of psychologists are adaptive is the comfort to the level of who gets to speak and therefore the messages are fractured and broken up all over the place and of course this is chaos and so and then we get kind of cycle back to maybe the Trump phenomenon that when chaos emerges the particular approaches that are very good at playing in chaos will tend to be more successful that approaches that are better at playing in order for example in a celebrated essay for medium after the Trump election of 2016 Green Hall described how a new online read religion was attacking the consensus liberal reality the blue church you talked about the blue church and the red religion as an insurgency against the blue church where do you think we're at well so since we have a little bit of opportunity to be more explicit I want to make sure to break a few things out so identified a couple of distinct let's call them entities they may not necessarily be self-consciously identifying as entities but they're collaborative they're they work together for some set of reasons so whether they're happening to be working together de-facto or intentionally as irrelevant so there is at least three one I'm going to call the establishment and the establishment you might think of it just the the inertial consequences of like builds more like alright so if I go to school at Harvard then I meet other people who are at school at Harvard and the people who graduated before me also into Harvard maybe I met them too because of the way the school sets up relationships when I come out of school I'm in a situation where I have social bonds pretty strong social bonds from them strongest that we form in our current society with people I went to school with and they're going to various locations where they have vertical relationships with former classmates that give them some advantage so what's happened is that basically I'm a very simple vector I'm more likely to achieve Authority in power because of this particular moment this particular social environment run that over a hundred years which is more or less the timeframe that we're talking about here 150 years or so and you have an establishment you have a group of individuals who have any relationship with each other that are relatively tightly connected and as human beings are want to do tend to relate in a fashion which is coordinated with each other they have similar sensibilities they have similar values they kind of like each other because they're friends they hang out in the same places and so they kind of coordinate and work together they certainly influence each other enormous because you can only listen to so many people and you really care about people who are socially connected right so if your sisters husband is the current head of NBC and you're the current head of Harvard then he's gonna care what you think you're gonna care what he thinks because your in-laws and by the way you're both in established positions of authority which means that you have high credentials to be important right so that's just the establishment the second is the deep state alright the deep state which is astounding me which is I think what five seven years ago that would have been almost nobody would have had that language in that concept and now almost everybody does which is a good indication that this something is happening right the deep state is kind of playing out the establishment narrative but now talking about it in the terms of institutional structures so if I'm a lifer at the CIA and you're a lifer at the FBI there's some likelihood that we have interacted with each other more than one or two times during our time frame and if she's alive for at the IRS then that happens too right so the same basic idea there's a continuity of relationship where I have beginning to build sort of an institutional loyalty to a set of what is this local culture the CIA as a culture the FBI has a culture the US military has a culture has many different cultures and by the way all the corporations that have military industrial or government relationships do - right so if I'm thirty year exactly to the next song but I've also done five stints at the Department of Energy because that's how it works these things begin to bind alright so that forms its own relationship you got the establishment you got the deep state they're very connected but they're not exactly the same thing and by the way there are many other structures that are in the environment as well those aren't the only two then you've got the deep church and the deep church to conceptualize that you have to think about it at a higher level of abstraction it's more of a psychological type and a way of being and doing which I described earlier but to recapitulate there's a notion of there being some very small number of people who are authorized speakers the nature of speech goes from small number to almost everybody large broadcast and it's one way there's no interactivity and to become credencial eyes as an authorized speaker is a very powerful place to be model you can either get that by being a member of the establishment in a deep state or by being a celebrity which is an odd artifact of broadcast media so that complex those three together hang together more or less loosely as this phenomenon right so it's not just the blue church but now if we want to refer to all of that as the blue church we can but just be mindful and I said the blue church is more of the the process that gives rise to a particular way of making sense and making choices and reinforcing that as a social field so then in in contrast to that this emergent dynamic this new phenomenon so I I characterize that as differentially as the insurgency and also as the red religion and then also as the decentralized medium so let's take it as two peers think about the blue church that Matt's - the decentralized medium so I have a different media topology and different psychological typology that gives rise to different abilities to send in to tell stories and different kinds of stories that are going to be upregulated mean magic all right meme magic is over here talking heads and classic propaganda is over here meme magic is over here and they very different and how they're shaped and who shapes them and how they show up now under here the deep state and the establishment have optimized for the blue church right there that's how you're successful is to become the ones who have the ability to speak to become the ones who have credentials and become the ones who have control over other kinds of broadcast style bureaucratic institutions like pass the EPA small current people get to pass the law everybody has to follow the law over here we have chaos we have a new niche that has opened up and nobody has figured out how to master it perfectly so now it's wide open now it turns out that if you're doing this well you're not gonna play that game why would you play a new game if the old game works really well and you're the expert at your control of this game so the people who over here are kind of the heterogeneous or the marginal in this case the losers are the last culture war which is broadly the the right conservatives and so one way of naming the alt-right which is semantically confusing which is to say the people who originally coined the term the alt-right are one group the way the alt-right is presented in this blue church narrative is another one i'm about to present a third and maybe problematic because it's going to be confusing but the ideas that's it's the way that these particular characteristics of conservativism add a little of personality type and a level of core values have begun to discover and Rico here on this new framework or we could just call it the insurgency and this is the new right the new group of individuals and institutions that are forming over here that are very different and they're just a different set of sensibilities so now where are we on that process I articulated this narrative I guess right after the 2016 election in point of fact to actually articulate several years before but most notably right after the election and described it in terms of here's a bunch of fronts of what we might think of as a war they're gonna be playing out there's the front at the level of the mass media there's the front of the level of the deep state there's a front to the level of globalism and there's the front of the most fundamental level which is a conflict between how we do collective intelligence broadcast style versus decentralized style and honestly I feel like the things that played out pretty much as described first the insurgency both formally through the Trump administration and informally through the kind of cluster of human beings who are gathering under this new medium have overtly identified the mass media as fake news I literally to the point where which in the cost I think recently you yelled while you you know when will you stop asking the American people to call us the enemy of the people or whatever happens to be right since now we're now on the point where it is part of the consciousness that the mass media is an enemy now you may agree with it or not agree with it but it's in the consciousness right and a way that it wasn't 5 10 15 years ago I mean it was in some level Rush Limbaugh has been saying this for a while but now it is the narrative and I think the most recent poll showed that something like 75 percent of Americans believe that the media is engaged in either over at manipulation or reckless propaganda so it's sunk in and we should just say that these structures aren't decreasing Lee credible and their effectiveness is I think rather obviously becoming less and less trite has less distraction so that's one front and I expect that to continue to accelerate because I've noticed that they have a really abysmal strategic sense so they keep to just they seem to keep punching themselves in the face and I expect them to keep doing so so let's kind of check the natural drift is away from mass media to decentralized media anyway because the technological technological shift is going there and we're also seeing it happen at the level of kind of psychological attention and credibility so then the second layer is the layer between the deep state and the insurgency and of course this is also playing out right we've seen the conflict happening at the at the top of the FBI we've also seen it playing out in the DOJ and the State Department all those sort of usual suspects I don't think we have much of this ability of what's going on and say the CIA or the NSA that's because their secret but it seems pretty evident that a conflict is occurring that is between what we would very clearly identify as the deep state the people who are in the highest levels of some of the primary institutions particular the level of law enforcement and investigation which we have I was going to try to decapitate the deep state that's where I'd start and it's more or less being successful right they're beginning to be moved out and of course the deep state is deep and is large and it's powerful so I don't think that we can call that one just yet but I would say right now that if I had to estimate it is substantially further along in the was like the soccer game World Cup so the insurgency is ahead 2 to 0 2 to nil and we're probably the 75 minute mark so the TVA's gonna have to start innovating quite significantly if they want to figure out how to make up that lost ground and reestablish themselves and part of the problem of course is that the deep state is seems to have been unwisely continuing to believe that its ability to control the mass media is a powerful lever is not recognizing that's in fact punching itself in the face by doing that and it doesn't realize that it hasn't got the right doodle-loop the ability to respond quickly to changes in the game and so it just keeps executing on old strategies it's like the the apocryphal Polish cavalry charging the German yeah Kaveri will used to kick ass we get it it's not gonna work in this war the war is change so I continue to expect that the insurgency will win this conflict now but not massive maybe 60% probability then the Third Front which is the the front that shows up as the new nationalism reverses globalism again same basic idea it's clearly a front and I think that's pretty straight forward and it's clearly progressing in that direction and Italy and the EU continues to have chunks of the EU shift from at least EU European which in fact is actually also globalist to nationalists and that seems to be accelerating that decelerating I mean look the palm didn't win in France but she did almost right she got in the zone I think Merkel is right now you know challenged so the energy seems to continue to be moving in the direction of some new form of nationalism which is contra globalism and of course since the United States has been the primary agent of globalism to the degree to which the United States is now moving in the exact opposite direction that's really tough like the globalist institutions don't have a lot of ability to enforce themselves on national institutions absent the ability to actually control the national institution national institutions directly so barring some scenario where things are more odd than they seem which is plausible I mean certainly there's many many possible scenarios I'm describing one that one is going to continue to basically be derivative of the first two with a vector in the direction away from globalism and towards increasing multipolar nationalism and then the last which is the most important and the most fundamental by far which is the shift of the balance of power from the media structures of broadcast in the blue church to this new set of media structures that are decentralized and again that continues to move we talked about the idea I mentioned there's of meme magic that has moved from being a thing that a very small group of individuals used almost tongue-in-cheek to a thing that I think almost becoming a discipline a guy would not be surprised to see like a university course on me magic anytime soon or at least an online online course and that makes sense because just everyday more and more attention just straight-up attention is moved to this new framework and more and more people are we're at a deep visceral level that the styles and approaches and people that are most fundamentally associate with the blue church don't work lost for lots of reasons like they don't feel like they work they feel incompetent or inauthentic and these new voices I think you've talked a lot about the intellectual dark web are showing up almost surprisingly but they're showing up surprising it for this reason which is it there there's a new possibility because it effectively what we're seeing is the breakdown the breakdown of this ideological structure yeah yeah yeah that says there's actually a really hard question so let me see if I can yeah I think she's got out so let me see if I can try to articulate it well well see so we talked about the way that the the broadcast works the way that feels this just used actually school schools a nice example cuz everybody's most people have been in school so the way the broadcast works is there's there's a person an authority and that authority has two primary characteristics one is they're the one who gets to speak and they're the one who knows what the right answers are and so they hold good opinion and they commit and their job is to convey good and good opinions you just share with you what is in fact the right thing to think and your job the audience the student is to learn and be able to deploy good opinion whatever it may be right now in a very well functioning version of this good opinion includes critical thinking but it's kind of a weird dynamic where the psychological the part of the brain the way that you are actually interacting with the brain that is associated with this style of information transfer is dissonant with critical thinking so it's like do as I say not as I do think critically think critically what did I just tell you to do think critically right I'm actually training what I'm actually training to do is not to think critically regardless of how much I say that I am in fact regardless of how much information I convey to you about how to think critically right the way you learn how to think critically is not by being taught then how to think critically by thinking critically in reality in practice and learning how to really feel in yourself when does something feel off and okay what's uncertainty and feel okay with them certainty but our actual academic environment and say under the regime of standardized tests as an example under the regime of it's a competitive landscape to be the one or two people who get to go to the good college they can get the good job like this so under the like the evolution of the way the education is operated in the States the regime of standardized tests so we we want to be able to be sure that the school is doing a good job so we create a test and with that it does of course as it begins to make it so that students want to optimize against that test particular the test has color like the SAT where you have to get a good score on the SAT if you want to get into a good college and if you get a good college to be able to get a good job anybody we have to get a good job to be able to simultaneously live a good life and to be a good person kind of that's the story so this creates a gradient right it Chris competitive landscape where you have to optimize against what are the characteristics necessary to do well in these various in some sense simple tests well there's a particular style of brain style of mind or you have to be able to very quickly and with high fidelity be able to access information and respond with the right information effectively all right it's computational Matt it's information processing mind and information processing mind isn't the same kind of mind is able to do say have creative thought or critical thinking it's different style of brain many people who have criticized education have been pointing this out this is not me in any way so when we use the concept we use the term ideology what I'd like to propose is that ideology is nothing but a pre-existing manifold information that somebody somewhere not you has largely constructed and has been presented to you as a preformed menu and it's some list of stuff that Orient's what is right and true and your job is to receive it Shh figure out where you are on that list and then choose whatever the choices that's associated with exactly like a computer program and so in ideology is how to run like a computer program and it may be a very sophisticated ideology that has all kinds of if-then statements and branches so has a lot of ability to process complex environments to some level of effectiveness but nonetheless you're thinking like a computer which is quite distinct from thinking like a human for example creatively intuitively and so the blue church construct as a construct tends to prefer and generate this style of thinking and you just think again about how it shows up in school who raises their hand first who has the right answer quickly who's able to respond very perfectly exactly what the teacher said if you're the student who maybe has a different idea about how this should be done you're maybe why asking a lot of questions you're probably not familiar with having a lot of success in school it's quite likely that you experience yourself as somehow losing in some way that was mysterious and that's the point right it's not necessarily the intent it's the nature of how this thing reinforces it's just like an evolutionary nature just reinforces a certain set of behaviors and strategies and this shows up all over the place so think about the glibness of how things show up in news or in politics right if news in politics it's all about being able to it's almost like stand-up comedy but the job is to be able to say the thing that is the barb or the gotcha or the framework that delivers the emotional payload that's already sort of been pre-arranged in the computer program you're playing a game you're playing a computer game it's all you're doing and that computer game just like any other computer game has a series of states and it has a series of moves and remember that old game I think was called King's Quest or Dragon Quest where it was a super stupid is like it was a cinema cinematic would play and you just had four moves up-down left-right and your only job was to watch the cinematic and go you know the right direction it's like that level is stupid so then what happens this is the run into two distinct dynamics simultaneously one is when you move into this new framework in this new decentralized medium it requires a completely different kind of mind that kind of mind doesn't work particularly well and the kind of man that it requires is very different requires a mind that can actually think it requires a mind that isn't only able to be a receiver but is able to actually be a bubble to be both a receiver and a sender everyone is roughly empowered to be able to to express as well as to receive and so you have to have complete different set of capacities instead of being able to listen record with extremely high fidelity precise of the semantic structure that was presented to you identify what context indicate that's the semantic structure to respond with and then when it confronted with those cement those environments to respond with that like a computer program your job is to be able to actually discern what is actually a thoughtful response to what's happening here in an arbitrary environment it can be completely novel how to learn how to think and and then how to convey with as much clarity and fidelity as you can now that's the optimal functioning I should mention by the way that in just the same way there ways to hack the blue church structure there ways to hack this decentralized structure and we've seen them various kinds of trolls and and means are the ways to disrupt this - precisely - degree to which mmm this is actually very important precisely to the degree that the decentralized collective intelligence hasn't yet reached a level of self capability to be able to make sense on its own basis it is catastrophic leave ulnar Abal to these kinds of attacks the blue church model can't do anything about me magic it's completely invulnerable to that approach and the emergent collective intelligence is basically a child it's an infant and so it can be attacked by this approach however to the degree to which a critical mass of into vigils reach a capacity to have the right kind of characteristics to actually be able to participate in a peer-to-peer fashion on this front they then generate a collective intelligence which is completely invulnerable to those sets of attacks so you're kind of gone through adaptive Ally you've escaped the blue church you've gone through the desert of mean warfare you've come out the other end with something which is categorically cape more capable of sense making and categorically anti fragile to this entire set of attacks attacked almost all forms of fake news are cannot be are fully parsed by this new kind of collective intelligence does that exist yet not collective intelligence no knows what I'm saying it's it's it doesn't yet exist so it ends up happening is that we've got a a dysfunctional because it's breaking down and has blind spots old form of collective intelligence and dysfunctional because it has not yet been constructed new form of collective intelligence and we're witnessing the middle so this new form is just strong enough to wreak havoc on the old structure and yet so weak that it can't stand on its own two feet and so that's sort of exactly where we are I should mention by the way that we should also be over here enough to destroy another crazy yeah and of course destruction is a lot easier to creation that's a very good irregular way of putting it in fact in some sense it can't help but destroy because the the structures of sense making of the old structure don't make sense they aren't really good sense making its you know I think Brett has this idea of metaphorical truth let's call it something like useful lies you know it's it's a here's of reality complex rich nuanced multivariate multivariate etc let me sort of construct a relatively simplistic narrative that kind of subscribes it enough to be okay and as long as we all sort of accept this we can coordinate that's the way the blue church operates it's kind of like the way that GE fabricates an organizational structure I don't want you as a whole person I want the vice president of marketing aspects of you which are kind of fun Jabil like the vice president of marketing aspects of you aren't that different the vice president marking aspects of the 50 people next to you right you have a certain set of raw capacities that I designed an organization to be able to interact with regardless of the human involved instead of an industrial model or a mass production model and the blue church has to do that with everything as reproduce breeds all concepts into relatively simple ideological frameworks not sensitive to nuance and so they're not real they're not actually complex and so what ends up happening is that as a new kind of intelligence emerges that has the ability to see that this isn't actually rich it cannot help but be corrosive to it now in the beginning it shows up as as insane it's gonna show up as not having any ability to discern what's going on and so it's going to be up regulating all kinds of craziness or just white conspiracy theories that go into the roof because it's it's it's like like if you imagine somebody who just got their spinal cord severed and they're trying to figure out how to retrain their spinal cord the signals that are coming down or all crazy it hasn't figured how to actually turn that back into signal so it it can very effectively critique the structures of the blue church sends out but it can't yet actually create really high quality sense and we should be clear I said member I mentioned earlier this is a psychological thing as well I'm not talking about we're going to be the same kinds of psychologists and either side of the Boers now like people who are bleached shirt psychologists or something in a jumper over here and things will just look kind of the same but better no no it's gonna be very different the way that ideas form and the nature of how concepts show up like the idea of transparent igniting mind if you remember that I do so we have a story of a guy named Thomas Kuhn who coined the term para structure of scientific revolutions so the way he talked about it was there's sort of a linearity of paradigms we have the Newtonian paradigm and it works into the gist to the point where there's a bunch of edge cases that it can't figure out people like what's going on here and some people want to be conservative and defend the paradigm and kind of ignore the anomalies and other people grasp the anomalies and it meant a whole bunch of crazy ideas and so a couple of crazy ideas turn out to be enough so crazy and then you get a collapse of the old paradigm and the transformation to a new paradigm and you know that's a cool story we may be on that process and maybe the blue church is a paradigm and this new thing this decentralized meme is a new paradigm my proposition is that it's actually a meta phenomenon which is to say that it's meted two paradigms in general that the entire concept of the paradigm is a thing that emerges inside a structure like the blue church that's a there's a model of how you make sense where you have a schema right a paradigm is nothing but a schema of what are good epistemological rules what does truth look like and what are collectibles good look like what are the good and what are the true how we know when we see them and we can sort of bind them very cleanly in this new environment we're going to be I propose now I'm sort of an hypothetical and I'm making predictions running a different kind of mind a transparent American mind one that's able to instantiate a microt paradigm under particularly local conditions that is adapted to the local environment but isn't identified with that paradigm and so that it can jump out of that paradigm allow this to dissolve and instantiate a new one or possibly even run two or three differentially just like Modern Portfolio theory in finance where I no longer have to have sort of a particular investment strategy I can abstract that to a portfolio strategies and I can keep abstracting up to a portfolio of portfolios of portfolios at a certain point I get to a trans portfolio concept which operates it a completely different information dynamic so the phenomena of the intellectual dart web for example seems to have arisen in in opposition to this idea of the blue church this idea of what we have is an ideology and a an ideology in the media and an ideology in in culture that maybe wasn't truly visible but the eruption of sort of the intellectual dark web has shown that oh there is an ideology and this is sort of a movement that is that is showing up the floors and that ideology and that in some sense there's a religion and you described it in our interview really well it's like what the blue church has done has taken the idea the values of openness and replace them with the with an ideology around openness so you have a certain set of things related to openness that you have to believe to actually be within the confines of the blue church right so it's kind of a religious mindset some ways well I mean now we're gonna have to be very careful because the term religion is not clear what I've noticed I actually wrote about this recently and I've noticed in that dialogue and discovering what's going on by I wrote it for the purposes of finding out okay what people respond to this is that the term religion seems to have actually been complexified for good reason it's actually by the way to include a number of other kinds of things that it is not at least three one is mysticism mysticism a religion are not the same if your religion is mystical then it's doing the wrong thing by the way if you're mysticism is religious it's doing the wrong thing another spirituality religion and spirituality are also not the same and then there's science and then when we might say quite obviously religion is not science but the point is that sometimes these two lines are crossed and vice-versa so my proposition is just to define these domains and my proposition is one is that these domains are all real they're all by the way necessary to any well-functioning human civilization and that problematics arise when we cross domains when we have one of them trying to do the other ones job or we have institutional structures that cross domains and in depth mixing them so for example a lot of the problem that arose in the West was that the church the Catholic Church broadly was doing both was doing religion spirituality mysticism and science all in a single institutional container and ended up crossing a lot of those domains so let me try to find them this is worthwhile so in the context of science what we mean is the loop process where we have a model of reality we then compare that to experiments of reality for the purposes of updating that model done that's it that's science science is the process of having a model and using experiments to verify that model is a good fit to reality it exists for the purpose of having good models with which to operate in reality by the way technology is the inverse of that technology is the use of good models of reality to generate actions that are effective in reality right so if I have a model of if science gives me a model of ballistics I can then apply that model of ballistics to build ballistic missiles so those two things fit together quite nicely spirituality is very different and it has nothing to do with models at all has to do with embodiment with a living and we might say the spirituality is the way that an individual is able to achieve integration congruence with self and then to be able to enter into relationships with world that are able to be integrated into self right so I am how do I come in to be able to be in relationship with myself where I am fully integrated in congruent and then as I go through life and have experiences how am I able to ingest those experiences to make those experiences still part of a fully integrated self I had a way avoid being traumatized by my experiences how do I avoid becoming disassociated as a consequence with my relationship with my experience was being in conflict with myself that is spirituality that's the essence of what that practice is religion then is kind of the community correlate it's how does self enter into relationship with other selves to form communities and then how do communities entrance relationship with world so as to be able to be adaptive to and thrive in world right so it's the embodied practices they give rise to enduring communities right that is religion as a function now notice what happens that when we will run into problems so let's imagine that we have these embodied practices which are embodied practices they're not stories we tell the stories to be able to help us understand and to convey and to reinforce the embodied practices but if we think the stories are where the truth lives and not the practices we've now crossed the domains we're now being to treat religion like science because the stories are a model if you are not living your religion if it's not actually embodied in your life you're doing it a great disservice and your self great to serve is in your community great to service and then of course you can even worse because with then what can happen is you can then try to actually do science from religion you can try to actually tell stories about reality about the world and then of course what you do because if your experiments with the world don't inform those stories do you then use it to change your body practices that seems like it's not gonna be very effective because your body practices have nothing to do with that across the one in the wrong direction so what I'd like to do is demystify this damn thing that there's a thing religion that has an incredibly important purpose that sometimes we might oddly enough some people have thought well why don't you call it ideology at which point I refer back to the definition of ideology ideology is what happens when science tries to do religion it creates a model of how people ought to live in community then tries to impose that model on how people operate many a third way to do things there's very good reasons why that can never work it has to do with the relationship between the complex and the complicated or why don't you just call it culture aren't you just describing culture isn't that culture and of course the difference is that culture is what you are doing religion is the doing nough sin a way so as to achieve a particular consequence so religion is the process by which we develop a thriving and enduring culture well that's not just the same thing as culture we might have a shitty culture and that's not the same thing and religion is a vector it's and it's an orientation to movement just like spirituality is not the same thing as just being a person spirituality is a process whereby you would try to achieve an integration of self with self and the relationship of self with world okay then you have mysticism all right now religion quite often crosses the streams with mysticism which is very problematic because obviously what's happening now is they're trying to create either that becomes a variation of mystifying science or becomes an ocean well when we just talk about mysticism is it becomes religion overcoating mysticism and mysticism is the hardest I haven't got a lot of clarity on this Jeff but let me try it it has to do with the pure relation of self itself how do we actually become clear in self so as opposed to head we become integrated self in relationship with world with your spirituality mysticism is like I think shows that mostly in practices like meditation where you're not trying to relate self to world at all you're just trying to get complete clarity on the nature of self on for example here's a concrete version of mysticism oddly enough what are your values where do your values what are your the actual basis of your vows that kind of doing deep into you not necessarily no not at all what are your values in the context of living but what are the values that are actually at the depth of you that give rise to you and their their orientation relationship that would be like a properly mystical relationship and it's mysterious because it has it is deep the only way you can get access to it is to actually get really good at listening to things that don't have structure because they're not coming from the outside world at all they're entirely internal and now would of course what happens is these things relate to each other to the degree to which I'm able to achieve clarity of relationship to self I'm able to achieve clarity to the nature of how that stuff works well then I can use that in my spirituality and so mysticism meditation is a good practice to have as a basis of a spiritual practice through it they're distinct right they're not the same thing a spiritual practice may rely on clarity of self to achieve integration of self relationship with world and similarly religion is a good basis to do science right you can't do science very well to say if you're in a culture that doesn't tell the truth if everybody is a liar science is very very dysfunctional or religion is about how do you actually build people who tell the truth how do you actually create the embodied practices like child rearing is a religious function how do you actually raise good people what are the practices and traditions and rituals that give rise to that that can only really well so far at least be developed in evolution time meaning in relationship with lineage that goes over a long period of time this is the thing that Jordan Peterson is I think most clearly trying to articulate in that space you know our archetypes our mythologies the ones that cover a lot of cultures and lasts a long time do so because they are the things that have been most deeply associated with what is worked those cultures that do certain things in certain ways endure and we perceive them as stories so we can we can listen to them but it's not the stories that matter it's the embodied practices if you're not living it you're not doing the religious aspect and then we can invert it right science if it's done well can tell us a whole lot about the nature of the world so science can tell us like okay well what are characteristics that give rise to an a self that can integrate well with the world what are the characteristics of different ways that we can make sense and make choice as a community more effectively thrive in the world its information it's its ideas its knowledge its insight but it's not living it right you can tell us what a good choices cannot make the choices so that's the distinction between these things and with that kind of a distinction now your question becomes much more complicated so what I would say is that the bleed church was an ideology in a used ideology to play and simulate largely religious function that in fact the thing that it largely replaced right about the turn of the 20th century was more of a religion a talk finesse set of cultural practices that were largely lived and received and taught by living that were not really the subject of information right they could be conveyed you might go to church when somebody might tell you what to do but it really matters is that every Sunday you'd do something or and then by the way there's something may not be go to church like it may be that every sin that your family gathers together for brunch and they get together and socialize and there's not necessarily a huge amount of consciousness there's not like a dick taught that tells you this is what you ought to do it's rather simply what you do and because it has worked for a long period of time what the blue church has done is it over coated that they actually had the very bad characteristic this is kind of that fifties sciencism that we can replace food with food and pill form that we can replace well replace all things that came from nature with things invented and engineered by humans that's the one of the worst vices of the blue church and did lots of good stuff when it brought us to the moon but it also had lots of vices and this is one of them is to try to go back in let's go with childbirth I think we're all well may be net were all I will make this as a strong assertion I will I will own this the set of the medicalization of childbirth that happened during the 20th century which was largely a consequence of this mindset and distinctly reinforced but the structures in the blue church was it travesty and is a fundamentally anti religious function that the the traditions of how you go about actually doing a good job of giving birth to a child that is conducive to the holistic characteristics of what it means to be a one child I have been completely over coded by that structure top-down imposed ideology and entirely ideological and enforced by shame how many mothers right now still do not feel empowered to make their own choices on how they want to give birth to their child but feel shame at not falling in line with what the ideological structures tell them to do that's a good example of how that shows up so now we're actually a very interesting spot a size of a fraction the population is still ideologically possessed it's still running old code it's running code that was derivative of an old machine some of which was adaptive when it was created some of which was malevolent when it was created much of which is no longer adaptive and the psychology that runs that code is not a particularly effective it's in fact not the psychology for this new environment so if you're running a blue church receiver like your blue church radio nobody's broadcasting on that signal anymore if they are it's noise it's noise yeah so no truth is broadcast on that signal or very tiny amounts of truth is broadcast on those segments it's no longer an adaptive strategy to tune in to be a blue church radio we need to do is find a way to turn into this new meshwork to become a well a router I suppose a network aware component that has the ability to do things like discern good signal from bad signal powerful insight from just repetitive information tune in to that which is most insightful as opposed to merely that which is repetitive or that which is destructive and then up regulate that with high fidelity take the part of the signal that is the good part operate you lay at that if the particle isn't and down regulate that and so by virtue of playing that role ultimately end up being part of what generates really cleaning insightful signal you've talked about game B in the past what is game a what is going B and why do we need to shift between one to the other so I guess what I'd like to try to do is is present a frame a way of thinking about it where we're able to to recognize that in spite of the significant diversity of approaches that have shown up in the various civilizations that have emerged since the dawn of Agriculture they are all in a deep sense the same kind of game and I mean that in the sense of a game meaning that the kind of thing that is played by people according to rules made up by people and enforced by people not by the laws of nature although in the context of the laws of nature for sure and this this seems to be mostly about a couple of basic characteristics it's a an effort on the part of people to be able to find a way to work together so as to dress and deal with the problems of scarcity at the level of nature not enough food not enough water and with the problem of rivalry in the context of other people both in the tribe and of course hostile external now it's a that's a pretty compact description of the problem that civilization exists as salt so if your civilization can't feed you then it's not viable if your civilization can't find a way to prevent itself from being torn apart from the inside by people struggling against themselves or if they can't protect itself from the outside it can't survive it so effectively every single civilization since the dawn of civilization has been some effort to solve those three problems in the context of every other civilization and hence history that's game a that entire block every single variation on that theme is game a and the civilization that we just currently live in is the winner of that game and and by the way this contains both the critiques and the virtues of our current political debate yes this civilization can be characterized as the center of all forms of Tyrian oppression yes the civilization can be characterized as that which has innovated all virtue and all advance these are all true they are not paradoxical it's just the nature of the way they came is played so then the proposition is for reasons we've talked about maybe ad nauseam so far today that game is coming to an end we cannot continue to play that style of game that we cannot continue to operate in a rival RIS way we cannot continue to operate in a in a fashion that is dominated by the logic of scarcity and by the way we need not we cannot and we need not that we are now near a point of potential transition and we're need a point of necessary transition we have within us the capacity to transition into actual abundance we have within us the capacity to transition into a way of being with each other that is premise thanh ante rivalry not rivalry but anti rivalry and that that this this transition is a very different kind of game game be and it's not the kind of game that is mysterious meaning that we've actually always been playing it a little bit we can all we can find locations at any point in time in any culture in any environment and your person's life or this the aspects of this was shown up the transition is about being able to orient reorient the basis of civilization and put it in the right order you know to put civilization on a footing of abundance and on a footing of the anti rivals and on that basis then to be able to categorically resolve all questions associated with scarcity elegantly without any real conflict and so now on this side I am also receiving both the optimistic and the pessimistic futurist narratives the optimistic geological futurist narrative is that we're on a one-way ticket to utopia no that's not true but we have the possibility of getting to something that is going to feel a lot like utopia to the people to us now like if we were to look at it and project for 100 years we'd be astounded by what can happen just like you know the crochets in louie xiv court would look at our modern environment and just be astounded by the abundance of what we've been able to achieve and then you also have the more apocalyptic narrative that if we do not if we choose the wrong set of paths and we refuse to figure out how to give up that which is not supposed to be part of this new world and do not decide to actually build these things that are necessary and innovative to invent new things did not yet fully exist then we don't make the transition then that which must come to an end game a will come to an end and we will not have any place to go and that of course will be presumably somewhat unpleasant so that's the story and some people would think that's quite naive to say that we can move beyond rivalry how does how does the ante rival Russ exist there's a whole lot to what you just said the first part is that I find that almost everybody who accuses something of being naive are actually not engaging in what we were calling thinking earlier that's a rhetorical move that's not in fact a proposition but let's moving to the second remember I mentioned that these have been always present that it is actually just a feature of reality that the rival wrists and the anti rival risks exist it's just that nowadays we're in a situation with the anti rather less is becoming more evident and more powerful in our day to day lives so the rival risk is most easily characterized by energy so things that if I have it like say a glass of water or a barrel of oil then you don't have it it's one of those things it's real physical instantiated material coalescence of energy in an entropic environment so that if you use it then at least some of it is destroyed forever well that's the rival risk yep we've got that all over the place particularly food water now on the other side of the continuum sorry not a continuum on the other side is the anti rival risk and in these days the language that we would use is something like information that well by me telling you this story about the nature of the enterovirus I lose nothing except for the energy that I expended to tell it but that's not the story and you gain it whether you like it or not it's a different story but at least you have it so now we both have it and this is not novel I've been talking about this nature of the scalability or the copy ability of information ever since computers made it possible to do that remember music but the other characteristic of the anti Ravel risk is that it becomes more valuable the more people who have it that the rival risks is valuable largely directly in relationship to the degree to which it is rare the antivirus is valuable largely to the degree to which it is shared I don't mean that aspirationally I don't mean that naively I mean that rigorously logically if I have a language and I'm the only one who speaks it it's not very useful if I teach it to you and I teach it to him and I teach it to her and we all speak it it's actually become very useful the more people speak it the more powerful it has become that is a very anti rival hrus thing the entire category of phenomena they're characterized by was called the network effect or Metcalfe's law are associated at the basis with anti ravenous phenomena okay well let me just connect the dots because I happen to have a direct I have been an entrepreneur I've built technology companies and we're talking about how technology companies work collaboration is the birthplace the origin of innovation innovation is anti rivalries if I have invented calculus I can then give you calculus and it cost me nothing and by the way much much easier than you inventing it yourself and then you might do something with it which is very powerful that I wouldn't have been able to do with it myself so it's actually become more valuable it's a more valuable tool the more useful and where it's shared well that's what we mean by the innovation economy the essence of the innovation economy is the discovery of the degree to which particular approach to working together collaboration is the essence that have a go about innovating and innovation is anti ravenous and innovation is the source of all wealth if you actually go back and look at history some wealth a very tiny minute wealth is generated by the sweat of your brow well I mean again Jesus said it well yes I can fish and I can get a fish I can give it to you rivalry I don't have it you have it you eat for a day or I can teach you how to fish anti rivalry I have not lost anything you've gained something and maybe someday I won't catch a fish in you will and you can give one to me it's more valuable honestly it's very simple the challenge is actually more about the transition the challenge is about how do we go about designing a new civilization structure on the basis of an anti rivalries psychology and not on the basis of a rival isn't on the basis of a scarcity mentality this is the real trick and even the people who don't have power but are thinking using the old model if your toolkit what is the phrase you cannot you cannot build a new house with the Masters tools or something like that that's a nice phrase if your toolkit is a toolkit that is in its basis very foundation a response to scarcity and the scarcity mentality designed to be adaptive to and operate within a rival risk world it's not the right tool kit for solving problems for and in an anti rivals one and so but that's not okay we have all the way down to the language that we use and so we have to figure out how to do that sleight of hand how to allow the space for this game B to emerge and it will be emergent they'll be emergent by design and we have a way to generate almost like parenting parenting is a great example i do not design my child but parents are necessary if you want to have a child in the relationship with parents our child seems to have three specific requirements or rules the first is obviously the creation of the fertilized egg which becomes the zygote the second is the bloom the creation of a space that allows the zygote to develop by and for itself on its own basis in on its own terms right not outside in the world I mean if I were to put the zygote of game be in the middle of game a drop it on to the streets of the financial district it would not survive very long it's not yet strong enough to survive on its own in the world but if we can create the zygote and then embed it in the womb then there's the last piece of parenting which is that when we think about ordinary design like say an architect designing a house or an engineer designing a vehicle all of the agency is in the part of the designer when we think about parenting the agency of the parents is always fully in service of the agency of the child and the agency of the child is primary so we can generate the zygote we can create the womb and then we have to be able to always be mindful to put our agency in the service of this world that is in the process of giving birth to itself and that's all that we can say in this analogy what's the womb this is going to be spaces that are created and enabled to be available to the people who are experimenting with game B so literally physically spaces incubators as it were or entirely new towns or cities I actually know that for example a number of countries are in the process of endeavoring to figure out how to build quote-unquote smart cities of the future so the idea in the Chinese of course had built innumerable mega cities over the past several decades well things like that we're going didn't happen you know two or more are going to have to gather and it's going to have to be a lot more than two and they're going to need to learn how to gather first in small groups just in houses and homes and to create this territory in this space where they can gather and practice game B and create they think you said the field but create a space where these practices are honored and they're explored and then those groups are going to need to come into relationship in larger spaces and perhaps this is where we just start thinking about things like resources I mean one of the primary aspects of game a is the necessity to continue to work in things that are not your highest purpose so the true to the degree to which that we can build through innovation to better innovation the ability to bring more and more people into a space where they can simply fully and enter into their most fully realized selves and thereby become available to source and support superior innovation we start getting an attic autocatalytic system and again let me present this in a way that is not naive let's take the lineage of technology companies in fact I'll I'll own it since you go to British accent technology companies in the United States of America let's go from Ford to Google let me take step General Motors IBM hewlett-packard APRA saw Apple Microsoft Google this something like that one of the things we noticed is we good in that lineage is they have shifted from a more scarcity rivalry based culture to a more abundance anti Ravelry based culture Henry Ford would have been rather surprised by the prospect that he should have fed all of his employees highly nutritious meals with personal chefs and provisioned them with places to play and to drive around on scooters for Google it's obvious because that's how you create a space that is maximally conducive to creative collaboration which is maximally conducive to innovation which is maximum conducive to making a ton of money we just need to push that further what's the further envelope you can get and I'm noticing that's actually happening groups that I've been collaborating with her beginning the process of trying to construct entrepreneurial activities that show up is having a game a side that can be very effective and competitive in game a but are actually anchored in a game B side and are oriented towards generating and producing taking the resources to come and providing them out into activities and envelopes that create these zones of these wombs for continuing development and exploration of a more generative community if that story the story that is told is true then it would be in our bones and be in our deepest mythology and our deepest traditions ideas religion that this is the place to go that when trouble is brewing gather together enter into this space this is where we do these sorts of things this is how we solve these kinds of problems you
