[Music] though Sheen your interview the interview that we put out earlier in the summer called a Zen master talks about Jordan Peterson in the shadow has become one of the most viewed things on our channel certainly the most viewed thing that doesn't actually have Jordan Pederson in it and some really interesting really polarized reactions so I'd love to explore that with you now kind of why it was so successful and also why people seem to either love it or hate it you're a Zen master we are back once again with the renegade master I think of myself more as a troublemaker renegade work so we were just speaking before and you said that it has already kind of affected your life in a way well it has certainly increased the number of people subscribing to our YouTube channel exponentially I might add so that's interesting we've had to create a little more content the polarization that happened on the interview was very interesting to me and I'd like to talk about it a little because I think it's a it's informative there's so much that can be learned from polarization when I read the comments I noticed just a rough glance about 40% of them thought I I was I sucked and about 40% of them thought I walked on water and about 20% of them thought I was just weird so to me I really pay attention to what Byron Katie says it's congruent with my experience she says we don't talk to each other we talked to each other's projections but only 98% of the time so what I saw was all of that that I was reading were projections they were projections of shadows some golden shadows and some ugly shadows but for me personally it was a gold mine because I know that even though their shadows and I shouldn't take it literally every time somebody projects something on me there's a hook inside me that that projection can hang on so it was a gold mine in the sense that those those those comments were mirrors that enabled me to see some things about myself that were fascinating so I want to thank you for that say more about what were those things well I I did notice that the one of the things that really upset some people not all everyone and again half the people that delighted half the people it it troubled them was my laughter and to me that is just it's a practice that we consciously do we call it sacred laughter I had a quick look back through the comments just before this interview and one of the things that a lot of people seem to talk about was they found parts of maybe the laughs we've already talked about but inauthentic fake or inauthentic what do you what do you make of that you know that that fascinated me if you talked to any of my students and you asked them what is the most important thing that they're here you know what they say and you can ask these two if you like it's my authenticity my integrity so that one really it really puzzled me I didn't see their there must be something in the way that I'm using emotions because I'm playing with emotions you know the we create emotions I mean actors create emotions for an impact and I know that that's something that I consciously do I must not do it very well as all I could think of because alle my colleague was talking about the woods and he was saying how perfect the reaction was because the art of of R in zazen is the trickster archetype it's the renegade archetype so the fact that it was so polarizing the fact that people have such a mixed reaction to it was in some sense a perfectly Zen reaction to the interview and that is conscious that is a conscious intention that I am deliberately doing the the the biggest thing I want to accomplish is I want you to be uncomfortable because that's where you're gonna grow safety is the most unsafe spiritual path you can take it leaves you frozen in fear unable to take risks unable to learn and grow and that is something I deliberately intentionally do you can ask anybody in the Sangha that as well this is part of integrals in you know if you're not willing to be uncomfortable you're in the wrong Sangha go find another one and we tell you that right up front something came up when you were talking about the reading the comments and it's quite exposing like putting stuff out there and then reading what people think of it what I hear you saying about this is extremely valuable information it's really valuable to have all of these people sort of reflecting back what they're saying yes it's valuable to reflect on that and in internally look at where the hooks are so the laughter was one example the collective shadows were another example you know I happen to think a whole lot of Jordan Peterson I think he's an amazing guy he's brilliant and I was fascinated just because I was criticizing one little thing people projected a devil on me that was fascinating that's a collective shadow that's if you don't agree with me I'm going to attack you it's not a very high level collective shadow it it is so important in integrals in to let everything inform you we let the body inform us we let the nature inform us we let dreams inform us we let our emotions inform us we let our thoughts inform us we let our projections and other people's projections inform us why would you turn away a teacher everyone is my teacher why would I rob myself of these teachings and this is something that I think a lot of people don't realize about spirituality or true spirituality which is it's not supposed to be a palliative it should make you question like true spirituality is is designed to make you uncomfortable it's designed to make your ego uncomfortable to allow something else to emerge yes yes the the ego wants to be safe the ego wants to be comfortable and it's not a bad thing this is why we're here we survived but it it is antagonistic to developing insight and spiritual growth and it's it's antagonistic to seeing your shadows because shadow work by definition is uncomfortable your your seeing the parts of yourself that you've repressed you're dealing with emotions that you've suppressed and it is guaranteed to be uncomfortable and true religious breakthroughs are the same way the insights so by definition by training it's my job to make people uncomfortable where does that become dangerous though because I think a lot of people rate question I think a lot of people are very suspicious of spirituality because we've we've seen many spiritual communities go bad and while they're going bad a lot of the spiritual teachers are saying no it's just people can't handle how crazy wise I am or how how I'm I don't follow your petty ball to our rules like this this can be very difficult how do we know when things are getting out of control and people are getting hurt this is so important in Bryn's eyes in the the Roshi the Zen master has absolute authority now this is problematic if a Renzi Zen master goes crazy he's got absolute authority he's got absolute power and he's he's the only one that's really this is a serious problem and you you see this problem happening all over spiritual communities you see it with my beloved so Gil Rinpoche the Tibetan Book of the Dead fell out of favor with his students my teachers teacher IDO Shimano had a real problem with this this is a real common thing where these Eastern teachers come to the West it's like they don't have the antibodies for the Western viruses that cultural viruses that they're succumbed to so what we've done in integrals in consciously the Board of Directors can fire me if I get out of hand we have an integrity circle that can challenge me and if if you were to form a complaint about me it would go to the integrity circle and they would evaluate it and they would determine whether there's a real problem and they would intervene and they have my ear and they have my total commitment to follow their advice if they say I need therapy because I'm in shadow and I'm projecting that shadow onto you they have the authority to hold my feet to the fire and if I if I don't succumb they go to the board of directors and they fire me it's in our bylaws and it's consciously put there to compensate for exactly this problem but it's absolutely in in essential we want the most awakened person in charge at least able to have veto power to keep us from doing something stupid as an organization so we're not willing to give that up but we have to have some checks and balances to compensate for my shadows and we have that well in place in this saga at what point does unsettling someone and playing with the ego become dangerous it can go wrong like it almost it almost seems spiritual communities almost go bad as many times as they go well it seems how do people avoid that generally I don't think you do I think you you need to compensate for that institutionally the integrity circle in integrals in which is some of our most senior students their job is to protect other students from my shadows and and their job is also to protect me from collective shadows of the students and individual this is a really important mechanism that we need to have real good psychotherapy and shadow work and people that are practicing at a high level of spirituality we need that to be in place to avoid that exact scenario and if you join an organization and you find that isn't in place make note take heed because it will go badly especially with someone who say and they have no I've heard that from spiritual teachers as well I have no shadows you won't hear it from me what do you if someone says to you I have no shadows do you run a mile should you run a mile no I don't run but I challenge the out of them I laugh in their face and I'll challenge them because if as Roger Walsh said brilliantly I don't care who you are spiritual teacher president of the United States everybody has shadows surely not the president the United States surely not that's the British oh my god does he have shadows surely not brexit right so I think this is really an important thing to discuss and it applies not just to spiritual teachers it applies to workship shop leaders you know you you when you're doing rebel wisdom workshops you need to have the same kind of mechanisms in place and if you don't it's you need to get some yeah and I'll be happy to help you with that we've learned we'd made lots of mistakes in coming to the place where we have and what I always ask is not do you have shadows that's a given do you know what your shadows are that's a more pertinent question and if you can't answer that question and tell me what your shadows are then I walk away mmm that's actually the very first whenever we do any collaborative project that's the first process that we do is going round and we use the format if you worked with me you would learn and then you would learn that I don't take advice very well I always think I'm right that and that is the oh that is invariably the thing that deepens the field and if you don't I think if you don't do that then you're whatever organisation or whatever collaboration you're doing is going to have unspoken stuff under the surface that's going to take you down at some point so it feels like a process that needs to happen I bow to that mmm yeah that's beautiful thanks I'm happy to hear that I suspected as much just getting to seeing the twinkle in your eye when we talk about shadows and spirituality yeah yeah I I think shadow work is the what's really interesting I think shadow work is the key work for right now but also there's a real upsurge of interest in it as well this is something that we've seen in our workshops people are now coming with a concept of the shadow which they would probably not have had even quite recently which I think partly that could be Jordan Pederson popularizing the union idea of the shadow but just generally does feel like the time of the integration of the shadow yeah he certainly had an impact on that there's no question about it and I'm just delighted to see that shadows are something that I have been studying for quite a while in fact a lot of my students affectionately call me and some not so affectionately the shadow Roshi and I I'm not sure if it's because I do so much work with shadows or I have so many shadows maybe a combination I will have to ask them could you give a concrete example of what this is something that we're often people often ask us how do you work on the shadow we talk about the shadow a lot can you give a practical example of how to work on the shadow yes so one of the surefire ways and I've heard you talk about this especially when you were talking about the interview and people's comments when you two were talking if something bothers you about somebody like let's take Trump for example Trump bothers me because he's so arrogant and he's so contracted and unwilling he just attacks when anybody criticizes he attacks them now if that bothers me and you see my energy coming up my emotion which is I'm acting right now because it really doesn't bother me because I've seen that shadow in myself I'm manufacturing that emotion for effect so some people will probably say that's inauthentic and it'll bother them and what does that tell us but they're inauthentic exactly exactly but if it bothered me that Trump was attacking every time he was criticized then that would be an automatic indication that I'm being defensive and that's exactly what I and that would be an example of me projecting my shadow onto him now he has a hook that my projection will fall on because he is like that he's extremely attacking ruthlessly attacking when anybody criticizes him he's hypersensitive to it so there's a hook this big dang my projection on him but if I'd look at him and I just see it's factual you know he's just like that and I can't believe that he's President of the United States and I really see the harm that that causes everywhere I look but it doesn't bother me with that level of personalized emotion now it bothers me because I'm an American and it's embarrassing you know for the rest of the world but I mean that's just showing the American shadow you Britt surely can see that pretty clearly Trump is a great example because on some level he is holding a projection and also the sense is for me at least that he is the perfect trigger for the liberal projections the liberal shadow but my concern is that at the moment the necessary self-examination that Trump has won the election the liberal worldview has been decisively rejected or rejected in the in the election by a lot of people who don't share it there is not there's not a lot of self-reflection going on from what I see in liberal America there's none they are in shadow and they need to do some shadow work you know the the book that Wilbur wrote on Trump really articulates that clearly it just nails that the the fact that the Liberals can't see how much Trump bothers them is even scarier than Trump to me the that that whole thing is in shadow and disowned makes them more dangerous than Trump more dangerous only because they're more evolved and what they're in shadow with is hidden they're much more skillful at hiding their shadow than Trump is he can't hide his shadow it's blatantly obvious which makes it less dangerous to me so what is the shadow that's hidden and that's context Erica's liberal arrogance liberal arrogance and passive-aggressive violence that's been repressed it's it's it's so likely to explode out I mean we we last interview we talked about culture wars that's two shadows conflicting right if if you and I were in that position where we polarized to the point that the liberals and conservatives had then we would be that far from coming to blows this is gonna explode in a very ugly way I don't see anything to make it better I don't see anything happening to stop the deadlock and that's frightening that's really frightening I think I agree because the idea of even a mediator between the two sides just seems like a non-starter at the moment like I don't see that was going to be one of my questions is there a way for America to pull out of the sort of spiral of polarization that it's in at the moment I don't see it short of a disaster so what do you say you asked me that question before you can ask it again I see disaster that's what I see and I don't see a specific disaster I don't prophesies anything but I see the only thing that's going to shock us out of this culture war that we're in is something so severe that it creates a problem that's bigger than the one we're projecting on each other that's the only thing that I mean we're gonna have to have a bigger enemy than each other to unite us into a new war against a common enemy that's how nature solves such problems called war and if you look at the world situation the center cannot hold that William Butler Yeats poem the second coming the best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity that's what I see happening what's gonna happen don't know I'm not a prophet but I really see where polarization leads us I see where it led us in the 30s into the Second World War there Shane thank you again yes it's always a pleasure David I I want to just really appreciate what you're doing and particularly because you're tackling the rough problems and questions that nobody else wants to tackle and the the brave effort that you're putting into this and putting it all out there on the line oh yeah oh yeah that's a Zen thing isn't it way it's an integral set thing right what are my brilliant students brought that in and they did great don't doesn't it feel good oh yeah it's like blowing up hey Shane thank you deepest gratitude anytime I'm so delighted that shadow work is becoming popular because it's absolutely essential our survival may depend upon this work [Music] you
