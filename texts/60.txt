[Music] in a way the phenomena of the IDW intellectual diet web has kind of flagged this up that there seems to be a quality of conversation that's had where we're genuinely going in without knowing the answer this is the meta conversation like that there's one thing to come up the right answers but even more important is how do we have the kind of conversations that will allow us to find these right answers well it seems to me that the beginning is to name it dust Li I wishes to say when I when I watch and was specifically when I watch watch ed like when when these individuals were just beginning to enter into conversation with each other well some of the ideas that they were talking about were insightful and interesting I found that what was by far much more interesting as what you're talking about which was noticing that there was something different about what happened when somebody was well thinking I mean endeavoring to listen to what the other person was saying and in not just responding with their prefab response that they had already written down on a piece of paper or had learned from somebody else but actually really contemplating it deeply and endeavouring to express something that potentially created something new or at least helpful and when I noticed that I noticed two different things one was that that was vastly more interesting and the other one is that it felt like goodness it felt like something that was needing that was that was needful like you know eating when you're hungry or more specifically actually more of a feeling of safety which I imagine is actually the feeling of hero right and it's the feeling of when people are doing something that is necessary in a time of what it is necessary in particular what it is not common I got imagine it's maybe the feeling that somebody has when they see the I'm coming when the fire is raging right courage is a as a part of that sensation and it is certainly the case that in this in this moment in order to speak honestly requires courage and I was gonna say in particular when we have to say is not that which is in alignment with good opinion but oddly enough I think it's even when it is in a line with a good opinion because I think there's something in the ambient environment that feels honesty as a as a bad thing in and of itself I almost a a complicity to always be ever so slightly ironic and never be fully connected to trying to speak honestly but at the same time human beings have evolved in fact won't even say it's the essence of what we are that differentiates us from our primate ancestors to be very very attracted to honest insightful expression so I think both were happening simultaneously I was reminded when you were when he said that it felt like something good a quote that the guy who put together the intellectual dark website use at the top of one of his pages was when two or three gather in my name I am there with them and it's a biblical quote yeah and I was very struck by that it really fits with what you were saying about there's a sense of something good happening when when these people get together and talk in this way yes I think this is right and I think it's deep which is to say that well let me use maybe Peterson's framework just to make it soft wicker self-reflective it seems to me that there is something that happens when to a more gathered together in my name and oftentimes in history we've needed that something to make it and the situation was not easy the situation was complex challenging and so it required that something that whatever it is that happens when we are gathered together in a space of well collaboration was just making it again very simple a space of peace a space of mutual understanding not for the purpose of delivering on the same opinion but really for going deep and trying to find something which is trying to frankly express itself like to listen and so if that story the story that I just told is true then it would be in our bones maybe in our deepest mythology and our deepest traditions I do this religion that this is the place to go that when trouble is brewing gather together answer into this space this is where we do these sorts of things this is how we solve these kinds of problems and you've spoken before that that can almost only happen in indirect interpersonal dialogue it's very difficult for it to happen in any other any other means well I have noticed being able to get there in virtual environments not very often or very common in just texts like Facebook posts it seems like there is a relationship between the the richness of the possibility of interaction and both the possibility and the quality of the relationship so it's a lot better and stronger richer and easier enter personally but I don't think it's impossible if I don't know it's not impossible I definitely have felt entering into this kind of relationship in say podcasts I imagine that in some among some certain of people or maybe it's some future date with this becoming a practice that many people go through that it may actually be effortless and that people are able to enter into this often there's a whole different story that maybe we'll get into another time as to why that isn't how we always are if we are if we are in the matrix as a an analogy and metaphor what is the matrix okay so to be meta just to be aware the first thing I want to notice is that for us to do this right we need to be a space of collaboration so the invitation is to have this not be question answer I am not the authority and you are not the listener but rather we are collaborating on this question so let's put the question in the middle we are exploring the question of what is the matrix so one of the things that really popped into my head very cleanly was this notion of that we've been using just in this dialogue of simulated thinking as being very much like a computer it seems like there's something about the way that the human mind can be made unable to relate to the world and instead run a program run an ideology where it constantly refrains its perceptions in accordance with the ideology as opposed to honestly in humility relating to a reality the makes it exquisitely vulnerable to control I would maybe bring in Vic and Stein's idea of the bullish mental language the the idea I think he said philosophy is about I'd love to know the exact quote but it is effectively undoing the process of the bewitchment of language that there's something in the nature of language the nature of being able to think in concepts that somehow flips into making us a prisoner of those concepts well interestingly enough very cool so as you were speaking you actually said I wish I had the quote and that's the bischmann of language which is to think that the exact specification of the actual sounds is the thing but it's not it's the essence of what he was trying to say and so to convey the essence is the thing that we actually want yes you did which is why I was so interesting like it popped in I actually initially was struggling with the actual words and then I realized that what I really just need to do is to listen there was trying to express itself through the words I think this is very I think that's like a big idea that's not like imagine imagine that I'm not very good at expressing myself and also imagine them trying to express something which is both deep and important well either you're going to eat just gonna have to ignore me right and just move on because I'm not going to be able to give it to you whole cloth in sort of perfectly wrapped magical material or we're gonna have to work together we're gonna have to both identify and recognize there's something here then maybe I have some piece of and if you can sense it at all that means you have a piece of it too so now we're never 'uncle Ekta bleah to kind of get a size of this thing you know it's the nose blind the blind men and the elephant except in this case maybe you're seeing it and I'm hearing it and I can kind of describe it as a soundness I don't really know what it is like yeah this was maybe it's coming from this kind of large lumpy object hmmm that's neat well everything interesting is going to be of that sort mine has never been said before then it's very unlikely that I have a very clean way of expressing it and if it's interesting it's likely it's going to be hard to express and so we enter into that and we enter into a place where if you see if you perceive the words that I'm using as being more of a map more of a hint more of a way to try to sort of begin the process of orientation around something which is itself transcendent and we're endeavoring to actually find a way to tune in to the transcendent using the words literally just as a way to make it more real more shareable more clear and in terms of the what this looks like what this kind of dialogue looks like there's a there's a form of it's almost like a meditation a speaking meditation that I was taught by raffia who is that the guy who is kind of leading helping us lead some of the men's what we're doing and it's called inquiry there's a form that came from the ink of the essence work that almaas put together and the the idea of inquiry is that you acknowledge you don't know the answer so you try and enter a space where you're listening to yourself as you're speaking as much as you're listening to the other person and you are able to be surprised by what my camera my come out and it's a very it's a practice of learning to to feel into what wants to emerge so it's a kind of it's a it's a form of meditation in that you have to learn that kind of nuance and learn that sensitivity to yourself and what wants to emerge which maybe fits with Jordan Peterson's observation that pay attention to how your words make you feel is this something that makes you stronger is it something that makes you weaker there's some kind of as I know almost like really deep listening to ourselves that we need to do to be able to get into the space well I can tell you that as you were saying that I was feeling very felt good and this is because I did not know the name that you described or the individual whose name you gave and yet this sounds very much like what I've been trying to do and yeah it's it's not I don't recall that this has always been the way that I have endeavored to listen and to speak and it's not always but it is always the best and that I've also noticed that it becomes easier that it is possible to actually have this place where you are somehow outside of yourself you're fully in yourself and you're expressing simultaneously and that from that place is where there's something really interesting beings to be possible it's kind of aligning ourselves with the creative principle as again Peterson talks about the logos mm-hmm yeah that sounds really nice yeah it's interesting so as I'm being very very very like noticing very closely it's initially very raw my price is really just a pleasure hmm yes that feels good yeah what was that ah that feels like what happens when something any senses that what just was expressed yes I can say yes to that and then after I say yes to it I can try to put more into it what about it was the thing that was yes I've actually very interested this notion to Louis for a long time I studied ancient Greek I am they've contemplated and this is the way that you just described it was very nice that that the alignment with the creative principle mm-hmm and that feels very clean mmm it feels like it's uh well true in a very specific Peter Sounion sense hmm I wish we could find a way to make that simple that little disagreement it bothers me hmm which disagreement sam Harris and Jordan Peters from the nature of truth hmm do you have a sentence on what it might be I know what it is I just can't make it simple I came to say it clearly all I can try to say it not clearly but that's always it just comes down to the fact that there are multiple different kinds of epistemology that the word true doesn't mean the same thing in every context like for example I can I can true an instrument I can also my aim can be true and then of course the statement can be true and these are related to each other but they also cover a different distance the way I would say it is that is that distinction I used earlier between something which is thought or a model and something which is lived so that a model is true to the degree to which it corresponds with reality call that Harris truth but a practice is true to the degree to which it generates thriving good it's only interest is just literally just two different kinds of truth and different domains and so getting confused about them is just getting confused about the fact that you're actually talking about two different kinds of domains that respond to two different kinds of truth that associate with two different aspects of reality and they don't cross over there's no point in comparing them they can be a relationship as we discussed in Harrison Harris Sam Harris truth scientific truth is able to make it possible for us to be able to be more religious in the sense that we could make better choices if we what is true at the same time Peter Sonia in truth lived truth is about us actually making actually better choices in our actual lives which is just a different thing so maybe that was simple peterson talks about scientific truth being nested within his concept of the truth that scientific truth is a subset of truth whereas the wider truth includes yeah thriving it's pragmatic it's it's about what what pushes us forward as Darwinian beings that the only definition of truth we can have is a definition of what gets us it has to be practical what I would say and this is just the way that I perceive it is that these kinds of truth are distinct but they are also inseparable and that lives truth is more basic or more fundamental than scientific truth but they are distinct so it's not really relationship of containment it's more of a relationship of well it's a very complicated relationship it's not if that is very not simple what does it look like do you think the what we need to do to come together or to to to be able to form the collective intelligence that's going to get us through the next 5 10 15 years well I actually think it's mmm relatively as they said that's easily done it seems like there's two basic moves the first move where we've used the phrase exit or escape the matrix so it's something along the lines of free your mind and your body from this legacy environment this legacy civilization the blue church and all the other accoutrement that environment most notably your mind the second move is well making more of a complex of news become sovereign find the others and turn to a you know two or more among us in my name with them enter into collaboration with them become sovereign as a group in some sense that's it because that thing that gathering of sovereigns who were entering into a relationship of higher level sovereignty has a level of consciousness and a level of intelligence and love of wisdom that is well certainly much more than any of us as individuals or any existing institution has now the only real novelty at the only thing that that we don't actually know how to do it all is how to do that with more than an old-fashioned tribe of people so we can build the skill its ambient it's part of our basic toolkit of being people if we can we can unlearn a lot of the adaptive techniques and strategies and habits and biases of civilization one of what I call game a the blue church and all of its past versions we've done learned that a lot of it but we learn a lot of these basic things but the basic things are still basic so we can relearn that we can instantiate the basic human toolkit of how to be people with each other and in that environment we have what it takes to be able to enter into this relationship of coherence but evolution only got us up to about 150 people it's called the Dunbar limit for wannabe intellectuals sort of the maximum size of a fully coherent tribe we should be mindful of the fact that that makes that that's actually truly coherent only in the context where we're all related really a tribe like every single person that tribe was born in that tribe and raised in that tribe then you have a co here couple hundred and fifty these days with practice maybe you can get it up to thirty or fifty I'm sure that some communities can get a little bit higher but not a lot but our challenge is actually harder just doing that as great as that would be doesn't actually solve the problem we actually have to figure out how to do with everybody we have to find a way to scale coherence well beyond 150 maybe even all the way to everybody certainly into the small digits 15 150 thousand that's new right but the way we're going to get there is by this first step yeah so individuals becoming sovereign recovering that which is theirs in the first place and then entering into this relationship of coherence with other individuals and becomes skillful at that becoming masterful at that and then using that from that place then doing the next work that's the place to do the next work what I find most problematic painful and distressing is when people try to do it from the old place it won't work it can't work that style of thinking and the style of coordination of working together it's just the wrong tool for the job that's sort of what's coming through for me is I sort of sense of trusting the field and it's very difficult to sort of express this in a way that doesn't feel sort of not crunchy enough for kind of game a type people but the sense is if we are able to come together in in that space then the right answers by definition will come up because that's the nature of creativity that's the nature of consciousness that's the nature of getting out of our own way enough for the right things to arise well I I don't feel that I have to go bet sounded to me like it was teleological and maybe I think the point here is I don't know I don't think anybody knows I think some that come to me you can know but I'm put I need to because the only thing that you can really endeavor to do is the best that you can do and maybe that it's not enough it may be that we do not have it in us to make it through this but this is the way that we could do the best that we can do and so if it is there if the answer is to be found this is the way to find it and to feel that it is a meaningful endeavor to do so so that even if the answer isn't there our effort was meaningful how does this link to silver ante so we're dealing with a word a sound and I'm going to actually put that in your mind first we're dealing with a sound sovereignty which by the way if your mind is the kind of mind that knows how to speak language it's going to interpret that as a word and then if it uses words and associates then with Beth with meaning it's gonna download a whole scheme of meaning notice it doesn't have to you could just choose to listen to it as this sound the reason why I'm saying that is that it's very important in the context of sovereignty to be able to actually take responsibility for all of these steps because in a conversation with somebody they may utter a sound that you goddamn think means something specific and they may mean something completely different and if you can't actually be able to slow down and say hold on wait a minute I thought you said this as opposed to getting into an argument about what you for sure no they said be able actually slowed down and say I wait there's something something's off not quite sure where it is it's back up a bit oh when you use the word the sound you added to sound sovereignty it seems like you may have meant something different than what John Locke was writing about or with the the folks in Montana keep carrying on about what do you mean by that so let me describe what I mean by it and the reason why I'm doing this is cuz I think a what I'm describing is a more powerful version of the essence of what that term has long intended to mean I'm kind of recovering it from the legacy of feudalism wrenching it finally from the from the grips of long dead kings and finally putting it back on the place where it belongs which is in fact sovereign individuals but then they're gonna do that I have to actually give it the meaning right you aren't born sovereign that's reapplying the feudalist model right you're born the king to this new thing what does it mean to be sovereign well it means to be sovereign is well first of all it's contextual it describes the degree to which you have the capacity you have the ability to respond to the circumstances that you find yourself in in such a way as to maintain or increase your ability to respond to the circumstances in which you find yourself in it's very simple it's a loop right so let's say for example I am sober and I am standing am I am sovereign in the context of standing means that I can keep standing the likelihood that I will spontaneously fall down is relatively low keep drinking at a certain point I actually lose my sovereignty I will spontaneously transform from the state of standing to a state of no longer standing I have destroyed my sovereignty in the domain of standing we can do this all over the place oftentimes say fighting or martial arts is a good one so every martial artists including boxing and fencing think that is aware of the fact that there's a relationship between your balance your Center where you are in terms of poised in inability to act and then what happens when you extend yourself and so in an optimal space I'm in this place where I can I can respond to anything you do as swiftly as I can with maximum impact and with a maximum ability to be able to respond in the next moment right so I don't want to get into a place where I'm suddenly on my heels where my balance is off I don't want to swing so hard that if I miss I'm not completely vulnerable and I can't do anything and if I do swing very hard I mean that calculated choice the next thing I have to have to get back into into balance have to get right into the stance so it's like a physical example dancers have the same sensibility right it's a sense of being able to be centered and poised but it's always in relationship to a context and it's always very complex you know let's say do you ever watch the the French soccer players Enedina Zidane we might say that he was very sovereign in the domain of soccer but not particularly sovereign the domain of having his sister critiqued by an Italian soccer player if you recall he went from being a masterful champion of soccer to somebody whose head bidding somebody in a field getting his ass kicked out the field tonight so his sovereignty was masterful in one domain but had a sort of fractal or a very specific vulnerability that got popped and caused the whole it cost the whole thing to pop right he literally got removed from the field is no longer even a soccer player so this is the idea now what we can do is we can generalize that so I can speak about your sovereignty in a given domain and then I can sort of think about your general sovereignty which is your sovereignty and an arbitrarily large nymburk domains and of course that that involves more general capacities so and that's that's like the give a man of fish eats for a day teach a man to fish eats forever you could become sovereign in some domain but you can also build a higher order capacity which gives you a generalized capacity for sovereignty in all domains so for example the capacity of discernment or the capacity of just self-awareness so she could do a simple one knowing what your emotional state is being able to be conscious of your emotional state is a general purpose always useful ingredient of any form of sovereignty and if you know that your opponent is goading you and it's making you angry and that's taking you out of your game well that at least gives you the ability to maybe choose not to be so angry not the end of your game if you know that you're getting anxious and fearful while you're trying to walk across the tightrope and that's gonna cause you to fall then okay may begin so that that's a more fundamental capacities especially with general purpose sovereignty there's a whole list of these kinds of capacities so let me hold that for a second come back so now we have a basic idea what sovereignty means in this context the way that I'm trying to use it now what I want to say is the reason when that concept is so powerful and important is the sovereignty is what is necessary to be able to play a role in this new emergent sense making fabric I remember in the broadcast model you had to be sort of a very high quality computer in this new model you have to be sovereign and the more sovereign you are the more effectively you can actually play a role in this thing because the more capacity you have to receive from the world to process it in a way that is responsible that you can actually respond to with the fullest aspect to what it is you have to bear to it you're not merely what's not rocking you out of balance and you have the ability to choose the best choice that you can make whatever it happens to be it may be that you're not very you haven't got many choices but you can let's choose the best choice and then you can send that best choice out with the highest degree of skillfulness you can bring out so now you've got a an ability to listen an ability to discern and sense and then your ability to express and if you have these three aspects in HI in a symmetric relationship and in a sovereign container so that they're able to be Integris against various forms of challenge which can be all kinds of things like one one thing that might overwhelm your sovereignty is just the velocity of input if you hook yourself up to social media and just like scroll through Facebook for ten hours you're probably overwhelming your sovereignty most people's brains can't handle that much dopamine and serotonin and you know nonsense other words they're actually from more simple if you haven't been eating at all for the past ten hours you're likely breaking your sovereignty your body needs fuel to operate to be able to operate effectively so religion and to some extent also spirituality building practices that are able to support an increase in individual sovereignty supposed to be able to enter into relationships with others so as to increase your collaborative sovereignty these are properly spiritual and religious domains so now we're actually reinvigorating the whole notion of religion we're using a more fundamental definition I guess this is the big paradox for me about meaningful collaboration can only happen from a point of deep individual sovereignty to really connect and really connect with someone else can only come from a place of being fully resourced in myself well you were used were deep so as long as you use the word deep I completely agree we can have we could have meaningful collaboration even we're both in reasonably poor sovereignty it's just we just got lucky or it hit us in a place that is most needful and it may be that the thing that our collaboration did is gave rise to how to increase our sovereignty but for sure if we want to use collaboration reliably and we want to go really deep the is now conditioned on a depth of sovereignty and a depth of skillfulness in listening having discernment and then expressing clearly right so the capacity to be present to what's happening without allowing yourself to be moved out of your skillfulness and then the actual skillfulness to be able to deal with that situation well or what is what needs to happen and again we can talk about this in particular domains like maybe in say computer science as a programmer but there's in this new world things aren't simple you are a computer programmer you may be playing the role of computer programmer for 15 minutes but then you're also doing all kinds of things constantly it's constantly flowing and rejiggering and maybe actually had a very interesting person writing a message yesterday about decentralized autonomous organizations noticing that an evil to be able to deal with these things that design them you had to sort of somehow be a sociologist an anthropologist an economist and a computer scientist simultaneously so I guess there's a good example and by the way that'll be a spontaneous emergence of a particular cluster of capacities that might be the thing that you're doing for the next three or four hours and then you're going to shift and now you're gonna be a relation in a relationship with another person and we're making food right and of course we know that we do that now but we do that now in these weird kind of like disciplinary blocks in the future these things and I even in the future in the present these things are flowing and they're mutating very very rapid they were just in a world of faster change and more fluidity so in this world that faster change and more fluidity your sovereignty and your skillfulness need to be based on the most invariant things so you can't just have say skillfulness of computer programming which is like give a man a fish you do have skillfulness in learning or even having skillfulness on the basis of how one becomes having a high capacity of being able to learn that's the deep basis if you build a a deep basis of sovereignty and a deep basis of mastery then you're fully prepared to participate in any form of collaboration in any context and now things get very powerful because let's say you find yourself with a group of 10 people you've never met before in a space that you don't understand seems odd now but in the future we're gonna see that a lot well what do all you do is you each is individual figure out how to get fully clear on your own sovereignty and whatever things you do to be able to really okay calling this up I need to be fully sovereign like you you know martial arts you get in in a fighting stance and then you start from nothing with each other you know for sure that you don't yet know anything so you begin to play experimentally you try different things and if you're all skillful if you all are aware of how this works and you're all sovereign so I say something to you that to a blue church snowflake would trigger them out of their mind but your sovereign so you're aware the fact that we're right now in a space of experimentation and playfulness which doesn't mean necessarily that you're allowing me to abuse you what it means is that you're listening and you're able to discern and you're able to be aware wait a minute he's actually abusing me clearly you actually are able to have perception on that and you can maybe respond to that say hey wait a minute I think we just moved into a weird space what's going on here and you can actually address it effectively clearly call it out in a way that it allows me to realize whoa you're right I was actually out of my sovereignty there and bring it back in and then of course is crucial I'm gonna call this coherence so coherence is when people are able to enter into a relationship where they basically been to form an emergent whole as emergent properties that is greater than the individuals involved greater than the sum of the parts and to achieve coherence first and foremost requires both sovereignty and awareness of sovereignty when you you have it and you're aware of where you are and a continual consciousness of recognizing that you have to maintain a certain level of sovereignty to be able to enter into coherence at all and the be in coherence has the highest intelligent has the highest capacity to perceive and respond to the whatever is going on so you prioritize that so first a - opera - yes okay cool now are we in coherence yes okay cool now let's start trying to do something if not if something is out of coherence okay how do we get back in coherence oh is it because I'm out of sovereignty Oh getting me to get back into sovereignty and kind of building back up one of the practices or techniques to build sovereignty let me do it in terms of sort of dimensions because we can simplify a bunch of pieces there's the body and the body is the basis of sovereignty so and it's kind of simple like imagine a two-year-old who is cranky is not sovereign you can actually think of your body as your little two-year-old so you have to learn how to take care of yourself how to parent yourself at level of the body so learn how to make good food choices learn when you're dehydrated I mean it's amazing how often people are dehydrated and how confused they are by the fact that they are in fact unable to think clearly and have clean emotions when they're dehydrated it's not confusing your body it's a corpsman of automaticity tired are you tired right I mean all these very basic things like I sent it's silly but almost everybody gets it wrong almost all the time so learn how to parent yourself at the level of the body for most people alive today the next one's going to be be aware of your trauma and the reality is is that we were all effectively enormous walking bags of crazy trauma and all the various defense mechanisms that have built up around those traumas and everything experience we have is filtered through that well unfortunately that's just the case hopefully in future civilization we're able to create human beings who don't have that in which case that won't be a major issue but here it is so to the degree to which you can just work through that trauma it generally sucks it's very painful and scary and can lead to having to actually make changes in your life which are themselves painful and scary but nonetheless the more you can work through that the better if you if you find that you're going to be engaging in a race it's probably useful to have learned how to walk first same thing here if you're going to be interacting with other people the more you could have done the work beforehand that has either eliminated or addressed the trauma and the defense mechanisms or at least has made them conscious the better and then of course also build practices and techniques and how to respond and bring so back into sovereignty when you find these various defense mechanisms and traumas are hijacking you there's a good concept called amygdala hijack this is actually a lot of very straightforward Neurology but if you feel like you're under threat let's say for example somebody shows up who happens to VOC the feeling of a bully who used to beat you up and you don't even even conscious of that but suddenly your body is under threat you may actually literally experience a Migdal hijack meaning that the blood is being pulled from your prefrontal cortex and being put into your limbic system for fight-or-flight responses well in that case you're not sovereign but one of the things you can do and then this gets two things one is you may have some habits that you've worked on practices that you've trained yourself to do when you're out of sovereignty and is like a martial artist who's trained how to get back up when they've been knocked down like he worked that over and over and get until it's just unconscious so you you work that error again and the second course is then also always flag yay I just got knocked out of sovereignty awesome I've just been able to identify a blind spot that I wasn't aware of before learn how to be attracted to that rather than avoid it actually see how well you can train yourself to be attracted to experiences that traumatize you not to get into trauma not to be traumatized but to get into experiences that are triggering because of past trauma so that you can become conscious of it so that you can see it and learn what the shape of it is and then you can of course go in to address it and then ameliorate it so you can come back in the next level is psychological and cognitive so at the psychological level if you are still running if you're still a computer but if you're still running the simulator of thinking rather than thinking itself one be aware of that notice the difference between them and begin the process of trying to figure out how to rebuild for yourself your capacity to think now the good news is is that's ambient right that's how we're born fortunately human beings are broadly speaking born with a natural seeking and exploring creative thinking capacity it is beaten out of us it is not natural and so to the degree to which to begin relearning that and we can double click on that if you'd like then you're moving into a space of being able to think and this includes things like not thinking you know the answer not thinking you understand somebody not using the process of inter of communication to achieve power or dominance over someone else this office often times worship is for example willful misinterpretation or self-righteousness and these are all sort of characteristics of what not thinking looks and feels like thinking looks and feels like curiosity it feels like well humility it feels like slowing down it feels like having a habit of responding to confusion by slowing down and being more careful as opposed to speeding up and skipping over it at the cognitive level now we've got this notion of transparent mind there's a really neat concept called mapping mapping has to do with the fact that everybody learned everything by virtue of actually experiencing things and then connecting some portion that experience with some notion like dog dog is a mapping you have an experiential manifold of all the various dogs who've experienced particularly ones when you first experience dogs and the notion of the word dog kept being associated with something in that experience are manifold at first who knows you may have cut out some big chunk of experience and associated with dog with like furry fuzzy thing that's drooling on me and also the couch because you're a baby you have no idea but over time it's sort of the differentials sorted out you've got a fuzzy thing which is dog well the point here is that your mapping is gonna be mapping to some stuff that actually isn't part of that just for you much less for other people and so I say sovereignty you've got a mapping well we've just gone through the process that it's at a cognitive level we can recognize that mapping errors or just mapping errors so flag I've got a map in here it what you just said doesn't make sense to me is this because I'm mapping it wrong or is it because I'm not understanding what you just said okay cool the way that's also a practice but the concept is useful yeah I mean there's lots more but these are examples yeah that's good even talked about that in terms of the context of mysticism so let's go into the notion of self integration this is a key one this is actually the combination so I did body and I did psychology I didn't do the two so let's bring the two together meditation is the the becoming exquisitely aware of awareness how it is that you show up as self absent all of the things and in its relationship with mind alright so one of the aspects of meditation is learning how to separate mind from self learning how to separate thinking or really it's actually the computer mind the programmatic mind from that thing which is actually is the or of deeper thinking so it's both useful in the sense that it helps you actually separate those two and necessary in the sense that it's a primary practice of being able to come into clarity of self which is the basis of all these other things and to do learn things like acceptance like how to actually be available to and open to what reality is actually conveying as opposed to endeavoring to cause it to be what you want it to be it's a practice that is for that it does that as that's the you can only get that through that practice that's one of the things that practice is doing and then another one is this notion of integration this notion of being able to become very aware of all the different aspects of mind and self and body and how they're showing up and what they're trying to say and being able to become compassionate I suppose or loving so as to allow them to express themselves right not to repress yourself not to be a tyrant to yourself not to have some aspect of yourself calling out and trying to call something up and just show it's up and speak itself and repress it and shove it down because then if you do that you're disintegrated you're out of integrity and this will create well it'll create a havoc actually evil for sure come to bite you in the ass at some point and make you extremely vulnerable to a wide variety of blind spots in sovereignty space so of course the key to that is self-acceptance so remember I talked about the mission of acceptance well the recursion on that it's actually able to enter into acceptance with self so that you can actually allow the parts of you that you may judge you may want to have your sort of computer mind has been somehow trying to say isn't a good thing or should not be happening and actually to allow those things to show up and to I'm gonna say honor them more than accept them because what you're doing is you're actually allowing them to be revealed as the purity of the essence of what they are which they are right but they may not be able to be clearly that until you've actually honored them there's a lot of depth here I mean this is not trivial stuff at all and I'm not even doing it particularly well but that's some of that as a birth and returning to the kind of the matrix idea what we are we're talking about I see that that metaphor as being about individuation ultimately it's all about individuation it's like how do you escape the traps of ideology how do you escape the traps of your thought running down conceptual lines because that's what we used to and becoming truly ourselves which is what you were talking about the sovereignty and that that for me is is kind of the framework of the matrix I guess if if what we're we're talking about is escaping from that it is the process of individuation okay so the word individuation there feels confusing to me probably because I have a meaning I'm from Texas so have a meaningful connection to more libertarian sensibilities so when I hear it I map it more in the direction of that which it stands opposed to communitarianism some more like individualism as opposed to individual but then I notice it's you're saying that I also have an awareness of it in the context of child development right that a child as teenagers adolescents are individuating which is that they are discovering who they are by virtue of themselves for themselves and becoming capable of being responsible is that sound like what you're referring to yeah and maybe it also links back into the concept of we can only truly collaborate from a space of genuine individual sovereignty mm-hmm and that's the paradox that many people get hung up on because they want to move to this space of no we want to collaborate we want to do this together but actually you can only get there once you've done the inner work to be able to collaborate from a place of genuine sovereignty well this is also very powerful thing in the context of the the false dichotomy they're just articulated there's oftentimes a well false dichotomy that we I there are individuals or we are communal and it's either consensus or its Liberty but what you're saying and would I agree with completely is the collaboration takes place in a space that is that transcends that dichotomy that it is precisely to the degree to which we are most fully individuated that we are most fully capable of expressing that which is most meaningful and also most capable of simultaneously hearing clearly listening clearly and expressing clearly because we have become clear right we've become nothing but that wish we are and the process of doing that requires a serious amount of skill maybe some of the heuristics that seem to be showing up in these individuals are for example courage yes they have the archetypal virtue of courage which is sort of notably absent from our yeah there was if someone asks me like why I even made some music with Peterson in the first place of what I likes by him and the first thing that came to mind was courage was bravery yeah who is someone standing up for something right whatever that is in in the face you could imagine that like a deep level like in our in our bones or even in our like reproductive organs the part of us that has been all about how the hell do tribes survive has a deep sense of when there are when there is no courage we're probably so when when we feel an absence of courage and then courage shows up we're like okay that whatever that is it needs to happen yeah right and so that's one one piece and then the other piece that we also see is well I guess I'm gonna break this into two one is this notion of a an unreasonable attraction to the truth all right so a sense of a willingness to say to take pain to like suffer in in defense of what is perceived to be true all right so rather than being able to capitulate or to equivocate saying no I'm just gonna kind of like come in and say what I think is true and I'm almost blindly not like calculating when I take the consequence cuz I think it's a good idea but for some reason I'm just wired is one of these people who just can't feel good about things not being true and then the other aspect over here is something about stepping out like a bigger picture like zooming out and taking a look at things that are not right in front of us and trying to say like wait a minute something's going on and again like if you think about this in terms of just straight evolution you can imagine that there's a situation where we've been encamped in a valley for a long time it has worked out we've got a good way of being and but we're noticing for example that maybe the hunt isn't producing as well as it used to where the watering hole seems to be getting drier every couple of years and most people still are just kind of like that's not there there's nothing thing and they're just focused on what's going on but a couple of folks they step back and like wait a minute what's that mean like what's happening here and something there whoa hold on guys we may have to leave now leaving the valley is dangerous as  going from where you are where things working understand what's happening to a new place it's a really bad idea so it's not gonna be well-received which is why it takes a certain kind of courage to be willing to step up and say it but because we've had to do that a lot to be humans and humans more than any other animal we're the only animal that is in fact designed the ability to get up from whole niche like to leave the African savannah and migrate to the to the Arctic we're the only animal that has to have some system that's able to be able to detect when it's time to do that alright so then this is the Buddhist step back and try to figure out okay what is the basis that we can actually use to perceive a bigger picture that allow us to make good choices in an environment where something is wrong and it's gonna be very subtle like you can't what name it very well if it's at the mythopoetic layer so maybe that's what I think is that that's what's happening is it's showing up you
