[Music] sam harris and jordan Peterson had these four debates over the summer you were the moderator of two of those in Vancouver what do you think was achieved in them where do you think the kind of lack of alignment is still and where do you think this debate is I think a lot was accomplished in Vancouver and I'm less intimately familiar with what took place in London and Dublin but in Vancouver we started out with two people who did not really know how much to trust each other and although they didn't arrive in the same place I believe they did come to a mutual respect and even affection for each other that as far as I know persists to this day I think for each of them there is a vindication in the distance that they traveled and then there's a bitter pill and it's obviously much easier to accept a vindication and a bitter pill and so the real question is what in the end will become of the two bitter pills that they each have to face in Sam's case the vindication is that in fact the universe does not need some divine entity to explain any of the phenomena that we see on the other hand the dismissal of people's religious beliefs as miss being misinformed or as a misunderstanding of the universe is obviously not entirely satisfactory these belief systems do appear to be the product of forces that have shaped them for a purpose essentially to benefit the people who - who hold these beliefs so Sam is grappling with the implications of that in effect it is a challenge to a simple new atheist perspective Jordan is in the situation of having a vindication of his belief that these myths in which he has argued that there is a deal of meaning are in fact what he says they are they are a kind of wisdom and they are profoundly important in human history for him the bitter pill is that they are not timeless there is no magic formula that would imbue them with the ability to tell us what we should do in novel circumstances because these myths are the product of adaptive evolution they are limited in utility to the circumstances in which they evolved and because we live in circumstances that don't look anything like the situation of thousands of years ago we should be suspect of these stories and their relevance to our modern problems so I think this has yet to play out and it will be interesting to see where Jordan and Sam end up wrestling with these things going forward but the fact that they can hear each other now and even to the point on the second night in Vancouver of being able to properly steel man each other's position I think is tremendous progress and you mentioned about the archetypes so Peterson's frames those as kind of pre-existing categories of being and you're saying that they cannot possibly be pre-existing categories of being well they can be to an extent but there is a shorthand that we use when we teach evolution and what we say is that evolution adapts creatures to their environment that is not what it does evolution adapts creatures to the environments of their ancestors and it the reason it looks like it adapts creatures to their environment is the environments of one's ancestor tends to look like the environment that you find yourself in but there are lots of places in evolutionary history where that's not true where a creature disperses over a divide or where something changes so that whatever was true for the ancestor is not true for the descendant we modern humans are in this circumstance in a way that is arguably unprecedented technology has rendered the entire landscape novel and so it's not that there will be no element in all of the mythology that carries over to this day but overwhelmingly there will be a mismatch between those myths and our modern circumstances so from the perspective of should we treat them as god-given and learn from them no if ever there was a time not to do that this is that time it's interesting you're talking about archetypes because I think quite a lot of people have a sense that there's something about Jordan Peterson that's backward looking even though the details of when they question that when he's kind of described as the custodian of the patriarchy or whatever the detail of of that is usually a misrepresentation but that there is at least an aspect of him that's that's backward facing in terms of trying to recover old archetypes rather than say we could use these to create new ways of looking at the world well hey I do see some aspect of Jordan as backward-looking I think the image of him that is portrayed is way off you know he is an interesting mixture of traditional perspectives and very modern perspective so you know in a way he's a little bit hard to to properly paint there's also I would argue a real value in an authoritative voice putting the brakes on the embrace of everything new it's not to say that I think we can live in the world that I think Jordan probably expects would be best for us I think that's an untenable solution to our problems however I also think a headlong rush into everything shiny and new is a mistake and so in a way Jordan has carved out the role of of Orthodoxy and to the extent that he now comes to a perspective that recognizes the limits of the inherited wisdom and says well we need to cautiously look forward and figure out what we're gonna do now that we know that our myths are very very noisy relative to our circumstances if he does that people will hear it in a way that they can't hear it from somebody who's so enthusiastic about what's novel that they erode their own credibility I think Peterson is restoring a burden of proof that is correct the burden of proof says do not change that which works unless you have a very good reason the architecture we've been handed is less and less functional so there's more and more reason to face the hazard of change because we simply can't stick with what we've got but it is important to have a force pulling in the direction of not throwing out functional architecture so that when you do throw it out you know why and you are sober about the costs you're going to pay for starting with a blank sheet of paper and I mean it's been said before that evolution is essentially conservative that it conserves it builds on what's gone before and Jordan Peterson users evolution quite a lot in his construction his arguments as a has an 11 area biologist how what do you make of that does he do it well he does it extremely well for a psychologist and I will say as much as I would love to see a landscape populated by people who think about human evolution who outshine him by virtue of the amount of time they spent on the question I don't see many of those he's quite good at it but there is a place where his argument runs out of steam and he continues to go with it there's a place in which he wants to find a timelessness and maybe a particular priority for certain myths over alternative myths that is not justified by evolutionary logic evolutionary logic says essentially the longer a particular piece of wisdom has stood the more likely it is to remain relevant into the future but we're still stuck with myths that come to us from several thousand years back and the world of several thousand years ago is one that not only is dissimilar from our world but in many ways is opposite the ability of human beings for example to damage their through technology it existed several thousand years in the past but it was nothing compared to our current ability to destroy the world out from under us using technologies that even placed the destruction at a remove so we're not even aware of second place and you mentioned before about Sam Harris and New Atheism you do you think that's an even more bitter pill to swallow ah I think the problem for New Atheism is perhaps more difficult because the people who have been most enthusiastic about New Atheism have been very public about their beliefs and their beliefs distilled down to something very simple which turns out to be incomplete there is no God in the sky who cares about human affairs and is meddling in them that much is true but the fact that believers are not delusional is that's a rather large correction for one's worldview so I think there is a way in which having been very public about a very simple story the transition to a more nuanced story is is difficult and you'll saying very confidently that it's not delusional weddy what do you base that on the fact that were belief in deities and the supernatural maladaptive because these things are held culturally it would be very easy to take the software program that runs in the heads of a particular population and edit out that fraction which was simply wrong in fact there's always disagreement within any religious tradition about which portions of the sacred to esteem and which portions to to down-regulate that is the fodder for selection to function that means that anything that we see persistently being passed on generation after generation must be paying its cost and then some because it's paying its cost and then some regarding it as an error is just simply a mistake so this is the very same kind of logic that Darwin used for physiological traits he was sent an orchid from Madagascar that had a very long nectar tube and reasoned that there must be a moth out there with a - with a tongue that long or else it would not make sense for the flower to have invested in this structure after his death the moth became known to Western science my point is that logic simply extends into the cultural realm and it very clearly applies to extremely expensive sets of beliefs that come along with the major religions of the world we know they pay their freight because if they didn't it's all too easy to edit out the part that's just baggage and where do you think this conversation goes now do you think there's any sense in another debate between Jordan and Sam what do you think they've they've concluded it well I think the debate is not so much between Jordan and Sam anymore I think what they have done is they have established the landscape in which this debate takes place in to the extent that either one of them alters their position enough to change what we can see that's great on the other hand now that they've explored the territory I think it's also open for others to join in and talk to either one of them were talk without them present and really the question is just like it is in any scientific exploration somebody discovers that there's a set of phenomena to understand and then others come in and define the details of what they find there that's quite natural so if they're enthusiastic about having more discussions I'd love to see him but even if they weren't I don't think you know it it means that things have stalled out it just means we've been shown where the discussion is and now it's time to have it where would you place yourself between Jordan and Sam well I actually had a discussion with Sam about this very thing and I think said it was clear to him in the same way it is clear to me that I was actually dead center between them in perspective which I you know it's it's just luck that that's the case because my position arose before I had any idea what their positions were but it happens that an evolutionary perspective on the evolution of faith suggests that these myths have a meaning that it isn't timeless and I don't know that put me right between them both in a physical sense and philosophically mm-hmm and you you describe yourself as an atheist do you have a conception of the sacred does that word mean anything oh absolutely I do find sometimes one has to redefine words in order to get the value out of them and I've probably redefined sacred a bit I don't call myself an atheist I think almost anybody who tried to evaluate my belief system would probably come to the conclusion that that's what I am but I've actually been made so uncomfortable by the simplicity of new atheism that my feeling is I can't even afford that saying atheist is now taking sides in a debate where I'm not on one of these sides I would like to be completely hard-headed about what is true in the universe but I do not want to back people into a corner whose beliefs arise through an evolutionary process so I hope one day that this particular discussion has had the stigma taken out of it so that it is comfortable to embrace atheism as no more than a description of what is true about phenomena in the universe that it doesn't carry an ideological component that as long as it carries an ideological component I'm cautious about saying that about myself so I mean that's why you chose the word sacred because for a new atheist that word would be meaningless so if it's not meaningless for you what what does it mean and well I see a a spectrum that runs from what I call the sacred to what I call the shamanistic and really this is a spectrum of caution or would be caution about change there are some things that are so essential to basic function that you upend them as a last resort and there are other things that you upend either because they don't have profound implications or because they simply don't function as they are and you must change them so my sense is that we have a kind of distinction between the sorts of matters that we hand over to a priestly class the sacred these are things you don't upend willy-nilly and the shamanistic stuff which is open to interpretation that is open to you know to hunches to following a thread and seeing where it leads so the sacred is simply that stuff which is so fundamental to function that one ought not tinker casually hmm and the shamanistic shamanistic is that which is up for tinkering either because the implications aren't profound or because the implications are profound and what you've been handed is no longer functional Brett thank you very much you're very welcome you
