[Music] so at the risk of overthinking an internet meme we're going to talk about the NPC meme which is definitely broken through into the mainstream over the last couple of days probably when a BBC article about it New York Times article about it social media starting to respond often twitter band a few accounts and link it to something that one of our contributors Jordan green hall has said before we'd put out a few things recently with Jordan greenhorn he's definitely one of our favorite thinkers and he talks about this idea of thinking versus simulated thinking I think this really helps to kind of identify what's going on and why there's some truth in it and why actually the truth is kind of the truth effect at the moment it's kind of used to attack the left but I think it points to something quite fundamental about the way we interact with the world so to start off by saying what the MPC mean is I'm not a gamer you're a gamer well is it yeah so an NPC in a game is a non-player character so as you're playing a game you're obviously encountering characters in that game who are computer-generated and they can be quite sophisticated so you can interact with them and they might have a set of responses I mean they do have a set of responses they are obviously they're running a script and you might encounter one go off and do something else encounter that same NPC later and they they just repeat the same thing they said before because they don't have free will or agency and so I guess the joke of the meme and I and what the why the meme has been so reacted against so strongly is that it the suggestion is that people particularly who are heavily engaged with identity politics they don't have free will they're they're running a script and they have stock responses to to everything and I think that that whole idea of you have no free will I think that's the thing that's really gotten under people's skin why because I mean it's absolutely core to being to your identity our identity our I think our egos identity is based in large part and that we are free agents in the world and we're making our own decisions so I think there's nothing more there's something that gets under anyone's skin more than than suggesting that you are you're effectively like part of the matrix you are running a script you're not you're not a unique individual well it's interesting you mentioned the matrix because Jordan green Hall appeared in the film glitch in the matrix that we we put out earlier this year and that was about the the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman interview which i think is the is still the sort of perfect example of of this sort of idea of simulated thinking because whatever he said there was a kind of it was like she was running a computer program and I think Jordan Greenhill said that after in the grillage in the Matrix film there was a kind of input/output and it didn't fit he didn't fit into the box that she was kept trying to ascribe into and but she never actually engaged what he was saying so that's a really good kind of example of it but generally we're gonna play a quick clip now from Jordan talking about thinking versus simulated thinking simulated thinking I'm proposin happens when something breaks down this ability to fluidly participate in both modes and in fact maybe even more precisely is went habit mode there shows up as and presents itself as thinking and this is where it gets very dangerous where one is simulated thinking the individual actually may believe possibly quite earnestly that they are in fact actually thinking when what they're doing is actually running some kind of script some kind of habit and of course oftentimes some kind of script there was not necessarily even theirs in the first place they're running a third party script malware as it were so the key point in this isn't just that there are two forms of thinking one is habit mode and one is explorer mode it's that sometimes habit mode is the right way to to interact with the world often it is and Explorer mode is labore it takes time it's not useful the problem with simulated thinking is when the wrong method is used when habit mode is used when Explorer mode is required and that's usually when the situation has changed especially when the culture has changed which we would argue it has and the the methods that have been used up until now in the culture especially is kind of defense strategy from a lot of people on the left of accusing other people of being bigoted sexist racist when they get on to topics they don't like is no longer functioning and I think that's the really interesting part is that simulated thinking works well when when the environment is not changing the environment is clearly changing very significantly especially if you're on on the left and you've been hit by bricks that you've been hit by Trump really we've said this quite a few times it's like if you if you haven't started kind of questioning some of how the way that you're acting in the world has that has contributed to these things that you were not expecting and not wanting to happen then what will it take for you to kind of think of we've talked about the shadow of liberalism which is this sort of tribalism that doesn't want to admit that it's tribalism and also kind of amygdala hijacking which is an interesting idea as well which is you know the amygdala is as part of the brain very old part of the brain which is really involved in our fight-or-flight response and just can take us over because it's based on our survival so anything that threatens our identity or like our tribal identity as well the amygdala can come in and we're ready to fight or run away I'm actually like our pupils get bigger at our blood goes to our limbs and we're just completely charged up impossible to have real thinking in that mode you can't when your sympathetic nervous systems going crazy you can't think straight like oh and we are all prone to it I get into that mode sometimes when I get really angry on Facebook it tends to be online actually which is the interesting thing yeah and so that and then this this idea I think Brett Weinstein talked about around it's pretty like it's pretty terrifying for us on a deep level biologically to say something that goes against the tribe and I want like this kind of similarity of thinking is in large part I think a way to make sure that you stick with the tribe because going into the tribe in the past would have been an existential threat but falling out with your tribe and that's sort of deep-rooted in to us is that it if you fell out with your tribe in any way that was probably the end of you yeah so I think Brett said this again is that we have to be able to evolve past the tools we've been given by evolution if we're going to survive because the old programs that we're running are not fit for the modern world and are probably well not even probably I think it's a definitely self-destructive so I find it's really interesting like if we're in a debate mode kind of the implicit frame as I'm trying to to beat you we're gonna play another clip from Jordan Greenhalgh debate we normally do is very much in there in the direction of a habit mode and as a consequence can quite often fall into simulated thinking and what a debater is engaging in a pattern recognition and rapid response activity with perhaps a specific small amount of focused thinking controlling the structure I think we should be clear that the primary utility is investing someone in a social conversation and that is at a halt conducive to collaborative thinking so that what ends up happening is that when someone shows up who's actually trying to engage in collaborative thinking and someone else deploys the toolkit of debate the debater will show up as winning at least to those who aren't watching closely and the thinker will show up as being oftentimes really rather stupid and so nobody wants to emulate that and so what is up happening is that it begins to select against thinking in both directions which is to say people who are trying to take lose and other people don't even try because it just looks like a bad choice and this shows up all over the place you know the political infighting is of this sort what he's saying is that the strategies that are selected for in that environment are kind of running a script it's running good strategy it's running this then this and then in that frame simulated thinking starts being selected for when you say this I know that I can respond with this and that will win the debate we're not in a place of exploring the question and if someone shows up who's actually trying to explore the question to think in public then that person will look like a moron because they're not they're not playing the same game but then that environment starts to select against genuine thinking and that has been happening for an awfully long time which is which ties into the whole intellectual darkweb concept because the intellectual darkweb if it's anything is the idea that we can think in public and I guess part of it comes from the trust that they have going on each other shows and knowing each other and then they're able to explore ideas knowing that no one's going to try and catch them out or kind of throw insults at them and say well talking about gender difference between between men and women you're you're sexist or whatever but I think that's really really interesting because I think that same process has happened in many different industries what Eric Weinstein calls the gated institutional narrative which is a sort of sort of self-protection thing where genuinely novel thinking it starts to be selected against and starts to be a losing strategy for people in these in institutions yeah I agree with that I think there's also what's been interesting to watch is this kind of accusation that the NPC me meme is dehumanizing because implicit in the ability to have a you know a conversation a collaborative conversation is the idea that we meet each other with a certain level of human human respect even if we disagree and there's been a lot of pushback from you know those spreading the meme saying well we were dehumanized we got accused of being Russian BOTS it's like yeah I can see that we already Huma knows each other all the time it's happening on both sides and it's part of it happens as well I mean we even do it in workshops that's what we tell people to look for when trying to find the shadow that one of their shadows you know we all have many shadows it's where do we feel like total contempt where we think this person is less than human and it's happening constantly and that is something that if we are going to actually get into a place where we can have these collaborative conversations while still disagreeing with one another it's essential that we come from a place of recognizing shared humanity at the very least like that's kind of a baseline because otherwise and we're kind of screwed it doesn't go anywhere it can't go anywhere it's you know it just gets further and further into the other is not human but I am this is another concept that Jordan greenhalgh talks about that what we need to create is collective intelligences that no one of us will be able to come up with the idea so we need to generate a collective intelligence and the only way of doing that is through collaborative thinking it's through I think this you taking what I'm saying and then building on it and building on it and building on it in this generative way and if we're if we're playing the same rival risk divisive trying to beat each other which kind of any YouTube comments thread or any kind of Facebook argument then what we're doing you can win that game but then you're just winning you're winning a game of quoits on the Titanic as the ship is sinking and I think that's true on a on a kind of interpersonal level something like Jordan Pederson talks about well yeah you can you can dominate your wife if you want to if you want to kind of win an argument what does winning an argument mean in a relationship well it probably means not winning being right and then then resenting you for the next 20 years it means how do you win in a way that keeps the health of the system and that's what I think he was also pointing to with his into his [Music] interjection about cavanaugh was how do we have an outcome that it that works for the health of the system rather than working just for one site beating the other again maybe that wasn't appropriate people have their different views on that but I think that was the context that he was coming from of how do you have an outcome from this but that doesn't add to the already kind of existential threats of polarization and partisanship that we've got in the system already yeah and I think it that brings up something that I think it was maybe like a common theme of what we're talking about right here which is it's it's about how we think not what we think like we're very focused on what people think and so much of this is so much progress is gonna be around how we think and then also where we think ok because I noticed like I really struggle with that kind of dehumanizing of the other online especially you know I really I have to prevent myself typing comments I have to you know I notice it happening in myself I notice the kind of righteous anger I don't really get it in person I mean I couldn't meet the same person in person and I have a completely different like oh yeah man just disagree with them but they're say she's cool he's cool you know and just get get into a place that's almost immediately much more collaborative because it's human human and so yeah how and where we think I think that's you know part of the next frontier so we're gonna put some of the clips that we've talked about including the jordan green hall one in the show notes and if you enjoyed this and you want to get early access to some other great films please consider becoming a patron
