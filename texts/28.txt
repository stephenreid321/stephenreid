[Music] we're putting out a whole series of films around psychedelics and you've written quite a lot of addict ecstatic experience just be good to just get a sort of potted history of your writing and interests sure so the first book I wrote was called philosophy for life and other dangerous situations that was about how people use ancient Greek philosophy today after writing that book and after it came out in 2012 I started to look at ecstatic experiences which I define I define ecstasy as moments where you go beyond your ordinary sense of self and ordinary sense of reality and feel connected to something greater than you which can be wonderful euphoric and healing but it can also be terrifying and sometimes damaging and I wanted to look at how people find those experiences today in Western culture how can we find in ways that are good for us as opposed to bad for us so I found I think Aldous Huxley's the greatest writer on this topic and he talks about upwards and downwards transcendence downwards transcendence is when you basically just you want to get out of your normal yo but you do it in an unhealthy instructive way you get annihilated on vodka for example every kind of Avenue to transcendence can potentially be unhealthy toxic and downward so I wanted to try and help myself and others find ecstasy in a way that's good for them and healthy for their society so I spent five years researching that and you know try to put together my thoughts in my in my book the art of losing control which came out last year I was interested in the history of ecstatic experiences and I feel like Western culture rather marginalized and pathologized ecstasy starting from around the Reformation as in by pathologized I mean it got redefined as a mental illness so in the 17th and 18th centuries rationalist materialist thinkers like Thomas Hobbes would say ecstasy is enthusiasm as delusion you're just letting yourself be carried away with your imagination in the 19th century psychiatrists like jean-martin charcot said ecstasy is just hysteria a symptom of a brain disorder all the ecstatics of yesteryear he said from Joan of Arc to Socrates to Mohammed are actually suffering from brain disorders 20th century psychiatry said something similar you know if you say I'm spirits are talking to me I'm connected to the universe that's actually just psychosis so that's the main story I think and as a result of that there's a taboo around ecstasy this is something that Stan Grof talks really well about yeah Stan Stan Grof is very important in this kind of thing so psychiatry pathologized ecstasy so we still have these experiences because they're naturally occurring but we don't talk about them because we don't look ridiculous or stupid or mad or the sense of synchronicities or yeah something that a lot of people when you kind of when they feel safe enough to talk about will say yes I've had that experience where it just felt like there was something more - there was some pattern sudden senses of deep connection to other people say or to everything or to nature very common happen to agnostics atheists believers they interpret them in different ways they're very common Bertrand Russell's walking down the street suddenly feels completely filled with love for the strangers around him for five minutes and it changes him for it you know he goes it doesn't be doesn't if I'm a Christian but it becomes a pacifist for his whole life so the main story is that pathologize ation and marginalization of Ecstasy but there of course being counter currents ever since the Enlightenment bits of Western culture that say no we ecstasy is important this is a this is a valuable good experience a good aspect of human nature we need to keep it alive but these have been subcultures kind of going against the grain from the romantics romantics absolutely Methodist Church 19th century kind of spiritualism and occultism and then there's a mass explosion of it in the 60s with things like Eastern religions things like meditation Hari Krishna or show Tantra psychedelics whether that's from indigenous cultures or or LSD rock roll experimental movie suddenly what had previously been quite minority in bohemian suddenly becomes in a mainstream there's that there's an explosion of inter mass culture of this of different ecstatic extract their practices and of a hunger for intense experiences including psychedelics one of the big problems as well as either we have this mainstream culture which still to some extent is frightened of ecstasy because we're frightened of losing control because our whole culture is about being this well controlled ego so the idea of really letting go of control is frightening to us because we don't want to kind of end up in section then we have these subcultures which you and I have walked in and and you know working to some extent where ecstasy is more accepted New Age culture personal development culture psychedelic culture and so on and we were queer subcultures I would say we're not mainstream culture we couldn't talk about some of this stuff on the BBC for example it's it's a it's it's still a bit to be probably getting less so yeah before I hope say slowly I work in academia it's still a bit to be maybe getting less say the problem in this whole culture is slightly different it's not one of pathologize ation fetishization exactly it's the opposite if the mainstream culture is aversion and fear you get the opposite in in a subculture of over attachment the desire for a spirituality entirely made up of highs yeah seeking it too much and then you say I don't know about you but I noticed it in my spiritual life sometimes I'll go to a retreat or a workshop or a psychedelic ceremony and I'll feel really high and flooded with meaning for about a month or two then a bit less height then I'll feel a bit bored and depressed and empty and they'll go what's the next adventure and it's like it's like a kind of you know it's like a kind of slightly full team rocket pack you know you go you go up into the air for a bit leaflet down stuff so that's a risk is it's addiction really ecstasy addiction I think I first became aware of your writing on psychedelics and an article you wrote for the idler and what I was struck by was that you were not afraid to go into the more metaphysical spiritual depths of what the experience meant and there's a lot of people writing about psychedelics but very few people with your background in academia talking about well what is the nature of the entities that we might meet when we go into these experiences and this is something that I'm also concerned about with with some of the studies that are being done at the moment like how how difficult to fit is this experience for the medical model this is something that a lot of people in the psychedelic world I think a very have a very concerned about there's a kind of push-pull because for the first time they're getting the mainstream acceptance of scientific studies and medical usage but also this brings in a very different conception framework it brings in a materialist framework it brings in the world of like double-blind trials it brings in corporate influence there's something and I have this sort of sense that there's something about the psychedelic experience that is a very difficult fit for for this paradigm right we want reinterment but we want it in a very rational predictable and measured way and I think that's what people are trying to do with psychedelic science and with contemplative science look we're getting transcendence look we're losing control but we know exactly what we're doing and here's a brain scan and so on and that can work two ways you can either end up with a form of spirituality which is actually totally disenchanted because it's been it's become so rational and instrumentalized and actually you're not get you're not going anywhere you know you're just in the same control freak capitalist culture the other way is that is that the science gets spooky actually the real challenge and the you know you end up Michael Pollan talks about you know shaman's in white coats the scientists become kind of guru figures all just weird stuff kind of comes through and and and and and challenges the model that you're bringing well this is like entities this happened with the guy who did the DMT research Strassmann yeah Stratton basically gave it up because he went into the DMT research as a materialist scientist and was so freaked out by not just the things that people were saying but the commonalities between what people were saying that it really challenged it really disturbed it really challenged his worldview and he also felt I'm not sure that I should be doing this right so I mean Strassmann he he wasn't exactly materialist he was a Buddhist he thought when people will take psychedelics they will have an experience of pure light consciousness and that's the kind of idea that goes all the way back to Aldous Huxley who came to psychedelics having very much in a research mist I was very into zen and vedanta and so on and he thought the highest truth was kind of pure light consciousness and that psychedelics would bring us to that highest trees but what Strassmann found instead was people didn't have this kind of clear light experience they had entity encounters lizards elfs all kinds of things but you know some of you know aliens and some of whom weren't necessarily benevolent I think there was one one person in one of the participants you know meets this alien and their participants really scared each case all his love all his love and the entity says something like even here or so till I heard of IDO is quite quite no quite they weren't necessarily loving often they're just kind of detached and like want to operate on you whatever so it's interesting when when psychedelic researchers think about these kinds of things that you might meet on a trip they will often try to bring a Buddhist perspective like Aldous Huxley these are just emanations of your mind so like just as the Tibetan Book of the Dead Book of the Dead says after you die you might meet scary monsters recognize them as just emanations of the own of the clear light of your consciousness that will transform it so likewise at the Johns Hopkins Laboratory there you get given trip guides the drug this is the laboratory has been very key to the psychedelic Renaissance and these guides say anything scary that you meet these are just emanations of your own consciousness recognize it go towards it accept it and surrender to it and become one with it but what if what if that's not the case that's just one theological perspective another theological perspective like say a kind of you know shamanic perspective or traditional Christian perspective might be that these these aren't just emanations your consciousness these are actual separate independent entities which could be malevolent it could be harmful to you and so you shouldn't go towards them accept them and surrender them when it's the job of the Shaymin to defend you from them so I don't know these are interesting I guess the point of this is is that you can't just you know this isn't just science this is also theology and metaphysics and it's also just totally beyond our pay grade who the hell knows right I didn't know what a medicine Medical School has been yeah all that stuff taught you know the nature of the spirit world and this is why you know Ernst younger the writer said to Albert Hofmann you know you're you might be messing with stuff just that you shouldn't mess with you often being a guy who invented LSD yeah you might potentially be opening portals that you shouldn't in the eye of global ayahuasca survey 1/5 of respondents said they'd felt under energetic attack during or after an ayahuasca ceremony it's 20% that's a huge amount so you look at indigenous cultures and the you know the emphasis they put on the need for protection the need for spiritual prophylactics when you're when you're in in you know opening yourself up I don't know should we know about that should we think about that and I said this to Roland Griffiths you know the Leeds scientist I said what's your position on on entities do you believe in bad spirits do you think we need protection from bad spirits and he was like well I would just probably see them as I would not see that as a belief I would not encourage that belief you said but it's interesting weather I suppose let's say in the future we all have lots of different psychedelic centers that we can go to that's already happening right and each of those psychedelic centers will basically have a different model of the universe so you're not just gonna pick your drug you're not gonna just gonna pick your Center you're going to pick your universe do you go to a universe that's totally atheist where everything is just aspects of your imagination do you go to universe where there are good and bad spirits and that Center will help kind of protect you from the bad spirits do you go to a universe which is Buddhist where all things are just emanations of pure consciousness so you know the old days we just had to pick our therapist but you know in 20 years we'll be picking our universe picking our metaphysics yeah exactly so this is and that's interesting and it's I think it I suspect it'll go the way of you know the William James thought you know he was a pluralist that perhaps reality isn't one in he came up with the word multiverse we're gonna you know we're gonna have these multiple universes that we can we can visit in through different substances and through different rituals you know the cultural containers which send us off to these different places I have sort of similar experiences the psychedelics that started a bit later than you yeah but I also found some of those experiences quite difficult to integrate and I think one of the will probably come back to this but one of the dangers is the sort of limited personality the ego attaching to the spiritual experience and making it all about me that that that was a real one danger but the other thing that that I really noticed especially in the psychedelic community was it's a community of people that are connected around the experience and my my personal view is that we have to learn to integrate the insights in a much more meaningful way and what often I found people doing was fetishizing the experience fetishizing the state but not really doing any of the work to bring that into their lives and that's one of the risks of doing this outside of established spiritual traditions because when they work those traditions they provide lots of warning signs and the kind of cultural container and an ethical container for these experiences and one of the things they warn about over and over is the risk of pride and self cherishing when you have an ecstatic experience because you know some Paul writes the letters to this community do you remember which book the call knowledge isn't great but it's the anyway it's a famous passage as always gets read out in weddings it's something like if I speak with the tongues of angels but I have not loved then I am about become a clashing cymbal or a clanging gong or something like that but basically it's writing to this community which is getting really into the ecstatic gifts they're speaking in tongues prophesying you know all these powers and these anything that's that's not the point if you're not doing anything to help people and serve people then you're just making a racket so that it sits and it's very easy if you you know have some slightly special experience to think I'm special and therefore to get attached to it at every time or you can get held onto it and as soon as we do feel special often I think fear and anxiety can come in as well you know because the ego gets inflated massively identifies and holds onto the experience so you have this experience of the divine you think I am divine I you know I'm special I'm really special and that can immediately I don't know if you notice kind of flip into kind of the opposite of that which is paranoia and just fear so on this ayahuasca retreat I went on last year I had this moment where I suddenly thought I'm psychic I I have I'm special I've got special psychic gifts this was in the middle of a ceremony and almost immediately that flipped in that feeling of I'm space so flipped into fear I thought what if I go crazy what if I can't handle that so I thought and I came across this phrase the trap of specialness so when we think I I'm uniquely special in this gift that is a kind of trap which can very quickly lead to feelings of fear and ungrounded miss so the an state that is humility like laughing yourself I'm not psychic I mean if I am I'm so minor you're gonna say I've seen my Lily psychic I mean like maybe everyone's got you know some good but yeah I'm you know it's just like the antidote for that is I'm not that special just laugh at yourself love your egos kind of games and humility you know comes from the word whom us for that's grounding like yes you're the divine someone's that says everyone else you're not you know more divine than anyone else which is something to be said for Christianity you know Christianity at the heart of Christianity that kind of even the symbolism of Jesus is don't get to above yourself yeah and there's there's also something that I've increasingly come to appreciate about the sense of dying to oneself sacrificing who one is and in some sense sacrificing the ego to become who one really is I think is part of the deeper symbolism of Christianity yeah I mean I like the idea of the more you can get yourself out the way the moon the more amazing things you can do or your ego out of the way if you know that we have the Tao or the divine in us and that can do incredible things more than we can imagine if we can get our shadow out of the way our smaller self it's it's kind of it's actually limiting us in terms of what we can do our desire to get the credit for it and the glory for it what do you make of Stan Grof because he he's been one of the big forces of this he talked back in the the 60s about the need for a psychology of the future that incorporated ecstatic experience and the net and the possibility of healing through ecstatic experience and I guess his framing of exotic experience is that it's these these experiences can help us heal or can bring us to more complete what's takes a more complete wholeness I think he's a he's a master I wish transpersonal psychology he must be probably one of the top three top five thinkers in transpersonal psychology and I think that field deserves to be far more mainstream and I think it is becoming more mainstream at the moment I I mean I think his ideas his and his wife's ideas about spiritual emergencies key and I think his 1980 anthology that he edited with his wife called spiritual emergency is a classic work I've never tried holotropic breathwork but I want to I think that's fascinating that you can get into kind of psychedelic states through through breathing techniques and I'm I'm told it can be a way to access like that experience but it's a bit less risky than drinking a lot of ayahuasca so much I know you can come down when you stop basically because that's right that's yeah my therapist after this Rakhi ayahuasca experience I had last year she kind of said to me next you're next it's like no experience should be through holotropic breathwork just so you can ease into it so you know i i've heard some of the interviews he's given I heard his interview he did with I saw your excellent interview with him and I saw I heard his interview with Tim Ferriss and the one thing that struck me is when I listened to him and like when I listen to Rick Doblin of maps and various other people in the psychedelic Renaissance I think they they're real optimists in kind of utopians about how if we have a society where you know the psychedelic non-dual experience is at the center we will then overcome all kinds of problems like the demonization of the other polarization fundamentalism and so on that it'll be a magic transformation because we will all have these non jet experiences therefore there will no longer be me and you they'll no longer be us and them and you know so that's really there's a whole political aspiration a whole political plan with with with them and in a lot of people in this like the Renaissance and my I just don't think as clear-cut as that my one-word response to that or one sentence response would be like what about the Aztecs that that is the culture we know because we don't have many precedents of cultures where there was a psychedelic ritual at the heart of it so the Aztecs had a psychedelic ritual you know they they we know they all did magic mushrooms and yeah this these were not wonderful tolerant liberals they were completely warlike tribe they the reason the Spanish conquered them so easily with just a thousand soldiers is because all their neighbors hated them because they would constantly raid their neighbors who they thought were kind of socially and ethnically inferior to them grab them take them up to their tower and and pull out their hearts and then you know take off their skins and wear their skins so the hippies would look kind of tolerant liberals so I just you know what sort of Charles Manson and John Lennon let's put it that way yeah yeah so the idea that you know there's a magic pill that's going to get rid of that's going to completely cleanse the human heart of all its problems and well this is just this is the president we have so you know in the very small database of psychedelic societies one of them was this was this awful I mean I'm not to say was all awful but it certainly wasn't you know completely pacifist so that's that's that's one issue I have with with snapple that's also the lesson I think both of us where it's certainly in the middle of a psychedelic Renaissance Michael Pollan's book was a real game-changer and there's a restarting of psychedelic research it's definitely underway and I think both of us have this sense of let's look at what went wrong in the 60s let's look at what happened when he had this huge exuberance that ignored the shadow yeah and I think this is this is something that we really struggle with as a culture to hold the complexity of yes this is a really can be a really positive thing but there's also a dark side to it yeah so the the dual nature of the experience yeah because it seems I mean I may be said it's likely flippantly but that's why Charles Manson was such a significant moment in the 60s was this was basically an LSD cult that then decided that the thing that they needed to do to cleanse the world of of evil was to launch a war starting with Hollywood stars and this this happens time and time again when the ecstatic experience is made the centerpiece of of any culture yeah and I'm sure you know many more examples of that as well yeah I think it is possible to have an a cultural container for psychedelics that doesn't involve human sacrifice we've got a hope it is and and growth and Hoffman and others got very into the Eleusinian mysteries and they called for a new alesis the Eleusinian mysteries were this ancient Greek ritual which existed for thousands of years I believe yeah I mean I think it was a real center point of Greece that along with in Christianity's last I think it lasted for like over two millennia and people would go there from all over Greece and they would drink a potion and then have this experience of death and rebirth and if you compare the accounts of participants in the Eleusinian mysteries like they didn't talk about it much because it was secret but Plutarch who was a priest there wrote about it bit and it's very similar to accounts of people on psychedelics they talk about this first stage of shivering and shaking and disorientation and fear and darkness and then an emergence into light and euphoria and it was very central to their politics and it helped to give them a sense of togetherness all these different Greek tribes who might be at war with each other but for that period they would they would kind of declare peace and go and celebrate their togetherness together I think psychedelics do have a role to play at the moment in helping us I think it probably will be a bit messy but the issue is that we've become so conscious so self conscious so conceptual so kind of closed to what's below the surface in us that we kind of need dynamite as Westerners to to get beyond that that kind of you know that modern ego and to get beyond our materialism we've got very stuck in this in this materialist worldview of the sense of the stolidity of ourselves and of everything around us and this is me and I'm this you know this is the table and it's all very kind of separate that's so very reminiscent to the McGilchrist talking about the left brain and the right brain yeah the left brain is sort of this atomistic reductionistic tool and the right brain is is what we've steadily kind of shunted out of Western culture that has an appreciation of the holistic can the inter-relational and yeah the the mystery now I don't know if he's right that this is you know connected to physical changes in our brain I don't know I totally agree with him on the experience level and I just don't know if I if he's right or not on the physical level but so and and I think we're we're disconnected from my own emotions as well from our own are from our feelings will become hyper conceptual I think McGilchrist says this kind of thing I see it particularly in academia as well therefore we you know we do need sometimes this radical surgery just to get us out of our heads but I know for personal experience that you know psychedelics really is radical surgery I mean it can be messy as well it's it's it's a blast but I think it's necessary because because I think otherwise we are quite stuck in our egos and in this sense of the solidity of everyday reality [Music] you [Music]
