[Music] so it's probably about 8 months since we spoke before we did a talk just before Jordan Peterson South Paris at their very high profile discussions and we talked about how to argue to the 90s it certainly seems to me that there's a bit of a shift whereas before the Atheist worldview was sort of quite cynical religious people are idiots at believing what they believe was dominant whereas now I've seen a bit of shit it sort of seems that now the atheists of the ones that look a little bit naive because they're rejecting a huge amount of the world's knowledge they're rejecting mythology and that seems partly related at least to the growth of interest in Jordan Pederson what do you make of that well I first was aware of a shift actually rather earlier in 2013 when my TED talk was so-called banned you may remember there was a big controversy I gave a TEDx talk on the Suns solution and then Ted took it down following protests from militant atheists peas ed Myers and Jerry Coyne who attacked Ed they didn't argue with what I'd said they just said what I said was pseudoscience and Ted had destroyed their credibility by allowing me to be there I'm familiar that's with that kind of attack usually people don't argue with what I say they attack the people who provide the platform so that then led to a persistent controversy which was very embarrassing for Ted and to start with the sort of atheist troll types dominated but there was a kind of backlash and gradually the whole tone of the debate shifted until they became a kind of minority and that talk which they of course couldn't ban you can't ban anything on the internet anymore has now had well over 5 million views and the majority of comments you know supportive most people can't understand why this talk should be banned or why even should be controversial I'm just scientific questions so that's the first time I saw the shift myself before that anything by me was instantly attacked by the kind of atheist you know the troll types his that is a huge paradox because in that all the science was he called the science division as well you were saying there are certain things that you're not allowed to say because of the dogma of science and the dog with his science materialists then came down and said basically prove your point we exactly I mean it was ironic I mean they didn't get it themselves the the irony of it but that's what happened and so for me the first sign of a turning point was then and I think it's accelerated this process and I think Jordan Peters has done a great deal to accelerate it actually and there is something about the nature of this have bottom-up sense making of the Internet is bypassing a lot of the gatekeepers now the people who have already made up their minds about you for example yes the Internet provides a an open forum for good or ill I mean all sorts of crazy people can get their views out on the Internet but it's for me it's been very helpful because because I'm a kind of proclaimed heretic in the world of science I mean it's not me that proclaims that but I'm sort of branded as a heretic then the normal gatekeepers and the mainstream media rather back off when it's anything to do with me because it's too controversial it's not that they're afraid of the views I'm putting forward they're afraid of people criticizing them for allowing these views to be expressed and you've indicated yet or are you is that some way off yet well the point I was making in the science delusion ten dogmas of science that I was talking about the changes that have happened in science since it came out have all gone in the direction I was suggesting and the one weather the greatest change has happened is in the chapter 11 of that book is called illusions of objectivity and it's about the way that scientists believe that science is true everything else is sort of false but science is true because it's replicable and because of peer review and I pointed out in that chapter that the way science is actually practiced the chance of it being replicable pretty low people pray to publish their best results they ignore results that don't fit their theory very often and indeed many journals won't publish negative results or for that matter replications and then due to three years later there was this enormous thing blew up in science the replicability crisis or the reproducibility crisis where it turned out that in biomedical sciences up to 90% of publish papers couldn't be replicated in psychology about 60% the majority of papers in top journals turned out not to be replicable and this has caused an enormous amount of soul-searching within science I mean the mood within science that normally I grew up with it being like that is arrogant you know we know the truth we're the kind of new priesthood everyone else is ignorant and basically deluded and what we say is true because it's replicable and it's subject to peer review it now turns out that a lot of it most of it is not replicable and it turns out to peer review processes very badly flawed again points I made in the science to Lucian and funnily enough three the English cover of the science delusion has sort of crumbling letters of the science delusion is in crumbling graphics and three years after the book was published in the midst of this crisis nature the top international scientific journal in discussing the replicability crisis had a cartoon of the temple of science with the pillars Krum the whole robust science across the top the whole thing crumbling which fitted this imagery very well I'm working on a new edition of the science edition them so dilution Sochi will include the nature cartoon which is ironic as well his nature was where that the famous editorial was published that asked whether your book in 1981 exactly yes Sara nature's been at the leading edge actually of this discussion about the replica the reproducibility crisis within science and you you also in the same book in the science delusion which is called science set free I think in America in America you said that we're seeing a credibility crunch of a scientific worldview is that more than just the rep ability replicability crisis oh yes I mean I think it's the area where it's most clear is in consciousness studies I think because until fairly recently most of science are still the official materialist doctrine is that consciousness is nothing but the activity of the brain it doesn't do anything there's no such thing as free will you may imagine you're conscious but it's a kind of illusion or a kind of meaningless byproduct of the physical and chemical activity of your brain then that's the official view and it obviously contradicts just common sense free well is something we have to take for granted as part of raising children the legal system courts of law you know it's it's just the fabric of all normal human life otherwise there's no responsibility and consciousness studies has also now started well for 120 years been looking at near-death experiences psychedelic experiences spontaneous mystical experiences the effects of spiritual practices like meditation and his enormous Lee enlarge the sphere of what we can talk about and of human consciousness and that means that the the narrow mechanistic view of consciousness it looks very threadbare and in fact question number of leading materialists a jumping ship and going over to Pan psychism the world view that there's a kind of kind of mind or consciousness at all levels of nature including electrons so that's been a massive intellectual shift I mean it's still materialism is the dominant theory and the universities in the educational system you wouldn't get a hint that any of this has changed if you study science at school for example it's still locked into absolutely old old-style materialistic thinking but at the leading edges of science and in the philosophy of mind there's been a real shift in mood well I think that the shift is more in within scientific communities more under the surface to know over to surf ISM the number of scientists who are true believers in the kind of Dawkins type materialist near Darwinian worldview is fairly small I mean as we did some surveys recently through the scientific and medical network in Britain among scientific engineering and medical professionals in Britain France and Germany some atheist materialists are about 25 percent of the scientific community there not a majority agnostics and non-religious people about another 20% said 45 percent classified themselves as non-religious and about 45 percent classify themselves as spiritual religious or spiritual but not religious and so the spiritual / religious is about the same proportion almost equal to the non-religious within science so the idea they're all committed atheists and materialists is just not true but the day the the militant atheists of materialist tend to talk louder and and claim that they speak for the majority and most other people keep quiet because they don't want to be attacked and do you have a sense that that's what's keeping because it's the gatekeepers more than anything the people who are commissioning science programs for the media or who I guess feel exposed if they if they did something or they commissioned something that was not acceptable to the jury coins of this world that they would then be attacked do you think that's what's keeping these other views out of the conversation yes I think it's part of that it I mean they would be attacked they don't just fear it they would be attacked because that's how the Gerry coins of this world work they attack the gatekeepers and for example I was invited to give a talk about three years ago to a leading independent school in Britain be Dale's school they have an annual science lecture open to students and parents is a big event and I was asked to dirt and I accepted and I thought everything was plain sailing and then the New Republic magazine in America published an article by Jerry Coyne attacking the school for allowing me to corrupt the minds of the young saying this whole generation of young people would be lost to science because they'd be influenced by me to adopt pseudo scientific views and he said I hoped his readers and he put this online too he said I hope you'll join me in emailing the headmaster of B Dale school to get Rupert Sheldrake disinvited and he put the email address and started a whole campaign to get me disinvited well luckily the headmaster you know just saw this as being a weird kind of American thing he'd and and the result was that the it sold out was in about two days and they had a wait a long waiting list but it that's the standard technique and that's why gatekeepers and media frightened because they get personally attacked for for doing this so I think it's also the case that many people in media are converted who converse to this sort of materialist view I mean they do personally believe it and they think that a lot of people in science education or these science media feel it's their job to persuade the public that the world is as Richard Dawkins sees it or as Jerry Coyne sees it well the the dogmas of science do you think needs challenged well I mean the ten I mentioned in my book are the ones that I think should be channeled I mean that you want me to go through all of them I can I can summarize them if you like yeah well first is the mechanistic theory of nature nature is a machine the universities and machine you and I are machines animals and machines everything's machinery and what that means is it's made of unconscious matter working in accordance with unconscious laws and forces and there's no purpose in machinery there's no consciousness and machinery the whole universe is unconscious the trouble is that you see when you think of the big bang theory the it doesn't look anything like a machine our present cosmology it starts very very small and it grows and it cools down and more and more structures appear within it the universe is much more like an organism than a machine no machine starts very very small and then grows and develops and develops more structures that's how embryos develop the big bang theory is rather like ancient creation myths of the hatching of the cosmic egg so we've implicitly got a kind of organic cosmology and living organisms it seems to me obvious that they're organisms not machines and we call them living organisms and say they're not really organisms they're just machines which is what mechanistic biology says is flies in the face of common sense and and all our normal instincts and and then it's oh that's a Tony a metaphor it's not even a testable theory it's just a way of looking at the world it's a metaphor another Dogma is nature's purposeless and that just follows machine tearing machines don't have their own purposes organisms do you know if you get on a horse it may have its own ideas about where it wants to go whereas you get in a car it doesn't you know it'll go it's just a mechanism will follow exactly what you want it's not interactive in the sense that it has its own desires the doctrine that matters unconscious says the entire universe is non conscious or unconscious all the styles galaxies the whole universe everything including you and me we're supposed to be unconscious matter so that's why consciousness in humans becomes a massive problem the so-called hard problem and that's clearly not a very viable way of understanding our own consciousness so it doesn't exist or it doesn't do anything and that's the reason we have consciousness studies as now luckily as one of the most exciting areas of science so then does the dogma that all the laws of nature are fixed at the moment of the big bang they all suddenly appeared like a cosmic Napoleonic Code and we're from well-known explains that they just suddenly appeared and I think in fact they're more like habits as a kind of memory in nature as my own theory of morphic resonance is a theory of memory being inherent in nature but it's not just me I mean Buddhist and Hindu cosmologies take it for granted as a kind of memory in nature it's only really in the West that this idea that nature's totally a music then the idea of the total amount of matter and energy is fixed that again is a dogma that got built into science in the 19th century but since then to try and explain the behavior of galaxies scientists have invented Dark Matter there's not a shred of evidence for it but they've invented at least five times as much as regular matter and then having made the universe much heavier and they expected it to slow down in its expansion more gravity because of more matter all those extra it and until about 1999 that's what they thought was happening then it turned out it's not slowing down this expansion it's speeding up safe had to invent another form of energy to push it apart dark energy and now dark matter and dark energy and 95% of reality and we haven't a clue what they are so this isn't so it's the total amount the same does it change actually the total amount of dark energy increases so the universe is not a perpetual motion machine then does the idea memories are stored in the brain and I think that that is not the case I think it works by morphic resonance the brain I think it's more like a tuning system than a video recorder all inheritance is supposed to be material or genetic or epigenetic and again I think morphic resonance is a large part of inheritance and attempts to explain inheritance in terms of genes have run into serious problems as I showed in my book the scientists illusion because they've discovered that genes only explained 5 to 10 percent of most inheritance it's called the missing heritability problem dense the idea of the mind starting with the brain I think the minds much more extensive than the brain and I think evidence for that includes evidence for the sense of being stared out and telepathy for which there's plenty of evidence that goes against the the next dogma that psychic phenomena are illusory they ought not happen because all the minds supposed to be inside the head and the 10th Dogma is that mechanistic medicines the only kind that really works the body is a machine so treating it chemically or physically by surgery or drugs is the only valid way of doing it but the host of alternative therapies and a placebo effect which medicine has had to admit show that it's a great deal - more - medicine than just drugs and surgery I mean any sensible doctor knows that of course people's attitudes their expectations their beliefs play an enormous part in whether they get better or not people are lonely isolated depressed have reduced immune system functioning at less resistance disease diseases people who feel loved prayed for cared for who hope they'll get better who expect they'll get better who have faith in those who are looking after them do get better much more than people who don't believe those things so the mind influence is netted that shows up in the placebo effect which is now very very well documented so medicine itself is it's very effective up to a point but the point is it'd be much more effective if instead of excluding all these alternative therapies dismissing them as pseudoscience and quackery and they were looked at scientifically and wherever anything works it should become part of medicine and where did you whether your interest in these subjects come from why why do you have a different path to the kind of classic material scientists but I became a biologist because I'd loved plants and animals so as a child I kept a lot of pets I collected plants and my father who was a micro he had a microscope lab at home and was a herbalist and a naturalist he encouraged me so a lot of it came from him I did biology because I really liked animals and plants and by the time I got to be an undergraduate where I was at Cambridge and I realized that the first thing you do in biology classes is kill what you're studying and and grind it up and analyze enzymes and things I was doing biochemistry at Cambridge and it wasn't really looking at the things that I found most interesting and for example as a child I kept homing pigeons and I was fascinated I still AM how do pigeons home I was no one knows even to this day we were never going to find out by killing a pigeon and grinding it up and looking at the enzymes and the so I was I just found that the questions I wanted to look at in biology weren't being looked at and it was just in this reductionist molecular biological phase and I wanted to find a more integrative holistic kind of biology even as an undergraduate I discovered the writings of Goethe the German poet and and scientist who had a vision of a different kind of science and I didn't know if that was possible but I managed to get a year at Harvard to study philosophy and history of science to get the bigger picture and realized that at any given time the beliefs of the scientific system are not the truth they're a paradigm the model of reality Thomas Kuhns book the structure of scientific revolutions had just come out where he has the idea of scientific paradigms and paradigm changes so from the age of about 21 or 22 I had the idea that could be a major paradigm change in science and I wanted to find ways of accelerating that process so this for me is a very long term quest my book the science delusion also and set three years the most systematic a statement of this that I've done but I mean it I've been working on bits of this virtually throughout my whole scientific career and where you feel whereas because there's a lot of people in this is a broader conversation that are have a sense of the need for a paradigm shift and perhaps accelerating certainly even even the structure or the way that we frame what we're doing rebel wisdom is we believe that a lot of the paradigm shift is being speeded up by online media like sort of the ongoing crises seeing around us do you have a sense I mean it's very easy when we're in these kind of little worlds to think that oh it's it's gonna happen soon or we're on the verge of it do you have any sense of where we're at well at least his regard signs there's no shift in the science education agenda I mean there's tiny pockets here and there of more alternative or holistic science but the mainstream science agenda hasn't changed really so generation after generation of young people are being indoctrinated with the mechanistic world view it takes many of them years to grow out of it if they ever do so that's a major weakness and paradigm shift but the educational system follows rather than leads of course it follows mainstream scientific thought and mainstream scientific thought is very influenced by what you can get paid to do most scientists do what they're funded to do they're on a short leash two or three-year grant cycles and they do what the grant money is available for and the vast majority of it is available to support in medicine you know drug companies molecular medicine sort of that kind of approach the British Medical Research Council spends about just under a billion pounds a year of our taxpayer money to fund medical research how much of it goes on alternative medicine placebo effect mind-body medicine you know looking at Chinese or Indian traditional medicine you know acupuncture and virtually none because it's all focused on molecular medicine mechanistic medicine it's extremely narrow focus so if you're working in medical research you're not going to get funded to do anything that's outside that model so there's plenty of people working within science you'd love it to be different and lots of scientists have more holistic views they're in their spare time have a sense of living nature and themselves as being part the planet and the ecological sense of the need to change many have also experienced psychedelics or mind-altering substances or meditate or have spiritual practices but when they get to work it's a matter of doing what you're paid to do so for me one of the big changes that I hope to see is changes in funding and this is an area where private funding can make a really big difference there are no more billionaires there than there have ever been before many of them have got rich through science and tech II type things and in the last two three years I've been approached by at least three major players in in the billionaire world who've said that they'd like to find ways of making science more fun more exciting and prepared to put money into doing that and I myself have been funded privately for 30 years now by maverick business people who made their money by being Mavericks who liked the fact that the kind of science I do is maverick science they think is more fun and more exciting than just more business as usual and if it were possible to organize people who've got far more money they can than they can possibly spend or to influence some of the larger foundation is to be more adventurous I think things could change and I know enough people in that world know there are big players who would like to see a change there's just they don't know quite how to bring it about there has to be means of setting up ways of doing this one of my ideas is setting up a kind of dating agency for donors who want to see unusual science and people with non-conventional science projects and so that they can sort of meet you know have dates and and and see what works and and put people together this would have cut out the middleman in the four of funding organizations with big bureaucracies who demand enormous ly lengthy grant proposals and stuff most of these wealthy people don't want to wade through pages and pages of reports and grant proposals they want a personal relationship with researchers who tell them what they're doing and who and with the ability to fund something really new and exciting so I think that's one way forward in fact is probably the most promising way forward the other way forward I think will come through a breakdown of the present healthcare system which is just too expensive and people will be forced to look for cheaper ways of bringing in healthcare and most alternative systems are cheaper than high-tech healthcare it's kind of going back to a almost kind of Renaissance patronage yeah I think I think that's what well it's it's actually it's already happening I mean it's how is worked for me that's why I've been able to function as a scientist since I was sort of excommunicated by the editor of nature in his famous book for burning editorial that he proclaimed me a heretic and tried to excommunicate me and believed that that would be the end of me but it wasn't because I've always been very fortunate to have people who believed in what I do and who've been prepared to fund it and one thing that helps is the fact that I both as a matter of principle and personal disposition I try and design the simplest possible experiments to get the most effective results with minimum cost and you know I've brought up in the British minimum cost experimental tradition so luckily this research isn't very expensive and actually in general holistic research is much cheaper than reductionist research if you're studying very small things like subatomic particles you need a 10 billion euro Large Hadron Collider to do it if you're studying the behavior of Jack dolls all you need a binoculars and a clipboard and paper or a computer so you can actually study things more easily if you're working at a holistic level and your new book is going beyond the science of spiritual practice do you have a sense that and also it's a sequel to another book called the science of spiritual practice is that because you're you're seeing that as a kind of window of validating validating spiritual practice as a way in to the materialist world well partly I mean what I think's happening at Memon is the basis of my last two books science and spiritual practices and ways to go beyond and why they work my most recent book is that in each book I discuss seven different spiritual practices which have been studied scientifically which have measurable effects because this is an area where science and spirituality are converging it's not any longer that kind of old standoff sort of scientists saying all that stuff's rubbish is a waste of time it's not spiritual view saying you know science is just too crass and and and and I just can't appreciate these things what's happening now is there have been many thousands actually of serious scientific studies of spiritual practices such as meditation which show how they affect physiology brain activity different regions of the brain health and well-being generally speaking these practices make people happier and healthier and live longer and so the science actually illuminates the spiritual practice and helps to validate it and spiritual practices enable anyone who wants to to explore the realm of consciousness and its connections with more than human realms of consciousness which is what spirituality is traditionally about the idea that we're not the only conscious beings in the universe and we I mean the normal materialist view is we are the only conscious beings apart from animals less conscious than us unless there are little green men with similar kind of science and brains to us on other planets but all traditional religion is based on the idea that there's human consciousness is one level of conscience but there are levels beyond ours that are more inclusive much greater and higher levels of consciousness to which we can form the connections and in which we can participate through spiritual practices you mentioned before some of the forces that are stopping change are we are we looking at some group think we're looking at you think that mostly financial or you think they're mostly cultural well they're both I mean most people have been to university have been pretty well indoctrinated with the materialist Atheist worldview and if they're going to discover any other worldview they have to do it outside the formal educational framework so the educational system is I think you know basically a hangover from 19th century materialism and enlightenment rationalism which is enlightenment rationalism is the idea that science and reason are in the got Vanguard of humanity religion and spirituality are just superstitions left over from the Dark Ages and the scientists of the new priesthood and we march forward in through science and technology to progress I mean that's the standard view there's some truth in it of course and we have much better smartphones and certainly much improved dentistry compared with 50 years ago and there is a major advance in technology all the time but that worldview is underlying the educational system in practically every country in the world that's what people are educated into and that I think is a major obstacle because it fills people's minds with this 19th century materialism and in countries like India and in Japan people are educated with this most some just don't believe it they they believe it when they're at work or when they're at school but as soon as they get home an evening they become fairly conventional Hindus Muslims Sikhs Jains or whatever I lived in India for seven years and very few Indians materialists atheist types but the science they do is like that it's just that they see that as a separate compartment separate bit of their lives those are the rules if you want to get ahead you've played by those rules but you don't really believe it you don't believe that's the ultimate truth whereas here a lot of people do really believe it and they feel that they can reject all traditional religion and spirituality because they now know the truth and anyone who believes these other things is ignorant deluded childish etc so I think that cultural thing brought about by our educational system is a major obstacle the funding thing is also a major obstacle to the change in science on the other hand one of the things that's positive is the spread of spiritual practices I mean millions of people now do meditation where as 50 years ago most people had never heard of it millions of people do yoga millions of people do martial arts which is explicitly recognized as a kind of spiritual dimension it's about the flow of energy through you and between you and your opponent is it's not just brute force and muscles as sort of force systems and bones as levers I mean it's it's it's much more subtle than that and and with the spread of psychedelics and the this new wave of research on psychedelics where many people are actually experiencing altered states of consciousness there is a massive shift happening but it's not happening within the educational institutions or within the political institutions but it's it's very much to the Internet is actually one of the main media for this and I mean your programs part of that process and who do you think are the really important thinkers that have probably been kind of not part of the mainstream of thought but are really important that we integrate if we if we're gonna move forward well I think that the the I mean young is one you know because he has a more inclusive view of the psyche than regular academic psychologists or the narrow and explicitly and dogmatically atheist views of Freud so I think Ewing is one of the key people in psychology I think that the shamanic traditions of understanding our living connection with nature or another and these would not be sort of famous people usually traditions from which many people are learning in workshops and and so on but not they're not like professors in universities an area that most people don't think about at all is is theology and there's some very very interesting work going on in contemporary theology you see after the 17th century the in in Europe theologians had to adapt to the idea of nature as a machine scientists all had to side to nature as a machine and where does that leave God it leaves God some outside nature possibly creating it in the first place like a kind of engineer or mathematician a kind of mechanistic God who's like a human engineer making machinery and it's a view that worked quite well for an industrial age where it's all about machinery and engineers and mathematicians and engineers are at the top of the priesthood as it were but the medieval view in the Christian West and in sufism in Islam and in Jewish mysticism was that God is permeating nature God is in nature and nature is in God that you it's not that God separate from nature but every moment the natural world is sustained by the divine being there's a kind of theophany or a revelation of God in in plants and in animals and in humans in the heavens and in all nature what's happening now is there's a move in theology to go back to that mystical theology of the Middle Ages and reconnect with this much more inclusive view of spirituality and one of my favorite theologians as someone called David Bentley Hart har T who wrote a book called the experience of God being consciousness bliss which shows that ultimate conscious reality as conceived of in Western Eastern and in other traditions has much more in common these views than they have that separates them it's basically a threefold model of ultimate reality which the Hindus call set chit Ananda being the ground of being is conscious yet is the contents of consciousness names and forms the kinds of things you think about or perceive and Ananda is a joy or bliss which comes as part of this ultimate divine consciousness the Christian version is the Holy Trinity Father Son and Holy Spirit the father's the ground of being the son is the law gas forms patterns ideas word and spirit is the moving principle which is also blissful and I think spiritual practices that involve movement like music and sports tap into this kind of spirit in aspect I think practices like meditation which involve going to the ground of consciousness and relate to this Sat or father aspect the basic aspect of the divine sustaining the universe through conscious being and the logger saw the form aspect it's what we appreciate through beauty the beauty of flowers the beauty of animals the beauty of art the beauty of architecture so I think these different practices relate to different aspects of ultimate reality and that's as I as I say in my new book ways to go beyond and why they work I think why they work is because they relate this ultimate conscious being conceived often is surprisingly similar way in different traditions and even Taoism in Chinese tradition which starts from completely different philosophical principles is this is essentially a Trinitarian that you've got the yin and the yang these polar principles that interact each has a bit of the other within it they're constantly interacting in this dynamic polarity but they're contained within the circle there's the wholeness that unifies is the ground of both of them so that again is a kind of threefold model and these are any models all these traditions say that ultimate reality if it's the consciousness of the whole universe and also transcending it is always bound to be beyond human conception given that we've got limited Minds that have adapted to dealing with practical problems on one planet in one galaxy highly unlikely that we could conceive of all we can do our best we can make models but ultimately it's going to be beyond conception and known only through a kind of direct mystical insight and how you describe your beliefs now because I understand that you you you have a huge interest in different forms of spirituality but I know now that you you are you a practicing Christian or if you come back to Christianity in some in some way I am yes I when I was in India when I went to India Rose still an atheist from my scientific education but my view of the mind had expanded through taking SD in 1970 or 71 when I first took it totally changed my view of what mines were like then I took out meditation transcendental meditation and yoga and so when I first went to India I was primarily interested in Hindu philosophy and then I had a Sufi teacher for a while and then I found myself drawn back to my own tradition which I'd rejected when I was a teenager partly because of my ideas about morphic resonance it's more more natural for me to be in line with the whole line of my ancestors and my traditions my whole culture is shaped by that and to amputate it is a kind of violation of the whole tradition and much better to come to terms with this and I thought and so I was actually confirmed in India at the age of 36 and then I found a wonderful Christian teacher a Benedictine monk who lived in an ashram in South India called father bead griffiths an English monk who'd been in India for more than 25 years and he for me was the perfect bridge between East and West he was deeply knowledgeable and influenced by the Hindu tradition we did yoga in the ashram we had two hours of meditation every day and so that was for me a kind of integrative experience since I've been back in England I rediscovered the Anglican tradition in which I was brought up and just came to appreciate in India I'd appreciated the temples and the pilgrimages to them I suddenly realized we call these unbelievable temples here in England the cathedrals you know in astonishing buildings built to express and expanded consciousness they're not functional buildings these vast vaults and soaring structures are there to express a kind of altered state of consciousness the stained glass windows in the Middle Ages when most people lived in huts and earrings sort of mud colored would have been you know psychedelic I mean they're still psychedelic the sacred chanting in these cathedrals happens every day and choral evensong the service sung by incredibly well trained in beautiful choirs in the evening all these things have just incredible cultural wealth and to be part of it and to be inspired by it and is I found quite wonderful and then rediscovering the tradition of pilgrimage in England I'm a patron of something called British pilgrimage trust - we're reopening the old footpath pilgrimage routes to the holy places of England that again is so just a wonderful way to relate to the land and to the history and to these ancient holy places but in a completely modern way the one of the things the pilgrimage trance does is has apps that work on smartphones who can find your way as you walk through the fields and the woods you can just do it with your smartphone now whereas a medieval pilgrim of course wouldn't have had that and I myself make a practice of going to church every Sunday morning wherever I am which means that I relate to the local community to the local holy place to have a space and the week when I can give thanks and pray and sing with other people if I don't get to church I don't have a space to just other things crowd in the 24/7 cultural crowd soon and I find that you know singing with other people is a wonderful thing to do it's a spiritual practice in itself praying for others and for the world is with other people I've joked myself every day anyway but today with others I think is more powerful and to be in these old holy place when I'm in a village I get to the village challenge may only be 3 or 4 people there but it's still I find sometimes it's boring that sometimes they're boring sometimes often there are quite good ones actually but for me I nearly always emerge feeling uplifted and in a better state to start the week and if I don't go and I just read depressing news in Sunday newspapers or or have to deal with emails or something I so I found these really helpful these traditional practices thank you [Music] you [Music]
