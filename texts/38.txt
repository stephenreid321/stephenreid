[Music] this fits into a lot of what I've seen Eric Weinstein talk about as well is that what we're seeing at the moment is a kind of a war on heterodox thinkers that there is some force that the that fears individuality in some sense I think that's partly at the root of this I think that there's some nuance that needs to be injected into the conversation what's the difference between a cult and a religion I think that the cult is a negative thing I think religion isn't a negative thing I don't think that religion itself is negative and if you look at people who get into cults and have to go through certain steps of deprogramming from a cult there there's certain sorts of ways that you get sucked into a cult and certain things that you need to do to get out of it that are alive and well and the grievant studies social justice progressive mindset there's a lot of like you're praised for certain characteristics and that make you feel good but even though you're being praised for individual characteristics that's not the same thing your identity is not necessarily the same thing as your individual this is such a difficult thing to pull apart as well because you're trying to hold it the complexity of two perspectives like there's there's a huge reaction to this from the write for example and so a lot of the reaction against the social justice groupthink is easily characterized by people as well this is just coming from the right but I think the complexity that has to be held is these are good values inclusivity is a good value treating people with respect is a good value yes but if you make these your primary axioms then they tend to lead to madness if you make inclusivity and diversity your primary axioms rather than the dignity of the individual for example rather than self-realization rather than free speech then you're in danger of like if you make care rather than truth your fundamental Val then you're in very dangerous waters very very quickly because by definition you are going to then have to stop certain people speaking if you think that what they're saying is not is in danger of offending others for example it's about and that's where it maps on to the religious mindset really really clearly it's like your religious perspective is what are you making your primary Aksum is what are you making your primary values yeah and that's that's a very delicate conversation to be had because it's very easy to say this whole social justice world is a cult and we've got a we've got to fight back against it and it's really it's it's in danger becoming a new religion but to be able to hold the complexity of saying we're not saying your values are wrong we're saying that taken to an extreme they become wrong yeah is it like it's it's almost like threading and I have a needle to make that to make that conversation or make those points in a way that doesn't that allows people to hear them if they're already minded to go along with this sort of very black and white narrative of goodies versus baddies and yeah you see what I mean it's almost like you know that that first scene and Indiana Jones the first one Raiders of the Lost Ark where he goes into the temple and he swaps out that gold bag with this statue I don't want to get to Peter Sounion but what happens is there's this swapping out of the ideology with the individual where the individuals taken out and what's replaced as the ideology so any criticism of the ideology feels like a personal attack and that doesn't necessarily have to be tied into the care principle the care harm principle I think that that can happen anywhere any ideology any religion taken in to that extreme where it's an imposition rather than a journey of self-discovery it's a communal rite of passage into a unification it has the capacity to stir up a lot of defensiveness whenever somebody criticizes that you [Music]
