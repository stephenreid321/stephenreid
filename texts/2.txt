[Music] Jeffrey I was really taken with an article that you wrote for Colette called the neurodiversity case of free speech loved it if you could just kind of outline the case that you made in that piece and I'd love to talk to you about I mean the piece was inspired honestly by the James d'amour Fiasco with Google right where this lovely ass P programmer d'amour is trying to approach Google his company saying I think you guys are doing certain things wrong and getting certain certain policy issues wrong about sex differences and why there's certain inequalities of outcome and he got hammered absolutely hammered even though he tried to express his concerns systematically and logically as possible right and Google basically said you can be systematic and logical but we are offended this is outrageous you're bad we're gonna fire you and then I looked at my own University's speech codes our own policies about what you're allowed to say and they basically were full of language that said don't be offensive don't be outrageous try to anticipate how people will react and as someone with Asperger's myself who has trouble with that right where I don't always understand other people's beliefs and desires as easily as as normies do I thought how the hell am I supposed to know what is going to cause a fence or what will cause outrage that's a totally subjective judgment so if you're putting the onus on someone with Asperger's or any other kind of neurodiversity to kind of interpret a speech code and to be so you're basically asking everyone to acquire a telepathy superpower to know automatically before I say something what will cause offense and not to say that and I thought particularly at a university that is a ludicrous and oppressive attitude to take because there are a lot of ass piece at university right they're over-represented in science technology engineering math and in psychology so you're basically asking academics don't have the kind of personality that leads you to become an academic and instead download this telepathy superpower will allow you to navigate this PC minefield this also applies to some of the kind of aftermath of the me to because now in many areas what's being said is that we can't have any unwanted sexual attention but you're asking someone to then know exactly what unwanted sexual attention is yeah so to the extent that men tend to initiate sexual attention and women sort of react to it you're basically putting the onus on young men to somehow understand which woman will be receptive to you know courtship under what circumstances and that's a that's one of the very hardest problems for young men to figure out with with the male brain it's even you know it's doubly triply hard if that young man has Asperger's or any of a number of other mental disorders or personality variants and I I don't think it's it's sort of fair in a moral or legal sense to say you have to be a mind reader you have to acquire this telepathy superpower and if you don't you should not participate in the mating market at all and that's the message a lot of young men on college campuses are getting this is what I hear again and again in office hours and classes as young men saying I am terrified to even try to date any woman on campus because I don't know what the rules are and if I make a single misstep I can be thrown out expelled you know lose lose my fellowship my grant lose my college degree basically for an innocent error of misunderstanding what I find really interesting about this argument is that it it it is actually very inclusive it's actually kind of often what comes in with this sort of sensoria sness of the kind of the more extreme social justice left is this sort of sense of thou shalt not but what you're saying is that that sensoria sness itself is discriminatory against people who don't see the world in the same way as the people making the rules yeah the irony is the social justice left say everyone must be treated equally you know regardless of race ethnicity religion sex oh except if you have any form of neurodiversity the means you're a little bit socially awkward or overly assertive or overly argumentative then you should be expelled you should be ostracized stigmatized your life should be ruined there is no place for you in our culture and that's an incredibly unwelcoming you know divisive unincluded attitude to have to act like everybody is expected to know these sort of sensitivity rules at all times and have you seen that happen in your campus specifically I've seen it happen a lot and and yet it doesn't happen quite as much as you think why because young men and particularly learned to self-censor like they learn really quickly oh my god if I'm taking human sexuality class there's a lot of questions I should not ask because 70% of the students are female and a lot of them will give me pretty nasty looks if I raise certain issues so what you end up actually seeing in in like my classes is the only guys who are willing to speak up are basically the mature students like the granddad is coming back to college age 65 and is just curious to learn stuff or the vets right they've served two tours in Afghanistan they've compact they don't give a shit they'll say whatever they want but the young men who are 19 who don't have those life experiences and you have a lot more to lose are incredibly self-censoring and you can hear it in their voices that the fear with which they approach a lot of these topics and this is this reminds me a bit of Eric Weinstein in an interview that we put out a documentary put out called glitch in the matrix to the origin of the intellectual dark web was that this these sort of tales of the distribution that kind of the really obnoxious or the really difficult people are often where the genius comes from yeah I mean where would civilization be without guys who have Asperger's you would lose literally about 90% of all the major technical and social innovations that have happened in the last several thousand years so if you shut down the aspies right what you would have shut down would have been like the entire Apollo program the entire tech industry the entire industrial revolution the entirety of science most of medicine all lost if you censor people who show all kinds of freaking neurodiversity and it's not just Asperger's there's also people with kind of light forms of schizophrenia called schizotypy who sort of have like weird beliefs and are eccentric and have have strange views of the world even people who are a little bit sociopathic or psychopathic can contribute amazingly to society if they learn to harness their particular strengths and weaknesses in kind of pro-social ways so if you only want the kind of normies to contribute to society like you could do that but good luck sustaining and advancing and civilization on that basis and as you said in the piece there's a kind of paradox of wanting to respect diversity but actually what you insist on is a kind of a modern homogeneity of different personality types yeah your homogenizing personality traits and you know when I I've written a bit on on mental illnesses but almost everybody who who is serious in psychology knows there's kind of a continuum between quote normal and personality variants and personality disorders and light mental illnesses and then like low functioning serious mental illnesses and you know Asperger's is kind of on a continuum with autism maybe it's kind of on under debate schizotypy is kind of on a continuum with schizophrenia sociopathy is kind of on a continuum with psychopathy but it's a big mass and nobody really understands the variation the point is there is variation it does matter it particularly matters in social interaction and communication and trying to take other people's perspectives so if you have a social justice left that's saying everybody must be exactly equally sensitive and built and able to anticipate any possible discomfort or a fence or outrage they're basically silencing the majority of people in society II think that's more applicable to universities and elsewhere and especially at universities right the universities are kind of a continuation of medieval monasteries where all the freaks and weirdos and nerds and eccentrics hung out you know that's why they became monks and like let's all get together and do like calligraphy and worship God and whatever universities used to be a sanctuary for the unusual and the eccentric and I think they still should be but if you let them get taken over by the the censorious social justice left then universities lose their whole reason for being and and like then where did the eccentrics go well they're going to go onto YouTube and be a lot less quiet about their weird beliefs and what about I know you wrote quite a bit about the James d'amore case what was it in particular they exercised you about that because here was a well-intentioned break did you identify with him I identified quite a bit with him I thought like if I was younger and I'd gone into the tech industry I and I had kind of his similar libertarian politics I could totally imagine that kind of thing happening to me where I go well google you're not being very logical about this sex differences issue here's how I think you could do better constructively right and he took such pains to express himself in constructive ways and a footnote and like link to the scientific literature and nobody cared they were just like we don't like your message you're a bad person you deserve to be burned at the stake or the modern equivalent which in some ways is actually worse so ya identified pretty strongly with him and you know reached out tried to be supportive and my worry is there are literally hundreds of thousands of other young people of both sexes like him working in tech and other industries who are now operating in a state of complete terror and aren't sure what they can say under what circumstances and where the companies they work for doing a continual bait-and-switch where it's like we welcome your in but please be radically honest please let us know how we can improve our goods and services and improve our internal HR procedures and then these people's like take the bait and speak up and be hammered it's kind of like one now in the 60s early sixties said let a thousand flowers bloom we're going to have an intellectual Renaissance everybody say what you really think but all they were really doing is gathering information about who to crush in the Cultural Revolution and I mean the other part of the James d'amour the situation was the fact that the the media was very I think there was there was an article by kana Freitas Frias door from the Atlantic where he said something like he's never seen a document that was so publicly available to so many journalists mischaracterized so much and I think yeah he basically said that was a there was a unique situation and it was a collective failure on behalf of of the media to construe it as an anti diversity screed when James do more specifically framed as these are ways that we could increase a gender diversity in the workplace yeah I mean for me personally it was also a turning point and realizing that journalists do not generally have the professional ethos to do journalism at least not in America not anymore before that I kinda sorta trusted journalists to get it right mostly because I'd interacted with science journalists and science journalists generally are good smart and honorable people and try to get the science reporting right but oh my god once you go outside that that bubble and you get into kind of general journalism clickbait journalism voxcom all that stuff then you know I don't think it was a failure of journalism to read the d'amore piece I think they intentionally either read it and mischaracterized it or knew that well if we read it it might soften the reporting so we're not even going to engage with what he said this is crucifixion time right this is the time to do our virtue signaling and tell the world not just this is Badman but to set the social norm that says and furthermore all of you other motherfuckers out there with this condition don't you dare say anything even close to this because we will ruin your life also and what do you think it says about the the current kind of culture of the media that it was mere mischaracterized that that way I think it shows that most journalists now aren't journalists or activists and they don't really care about the truth they care about and spending their particular narrative and they will sacrifice the truth very eagerly to promote that narrative so if they have a certain you know role of the evilness that they want to fit you into they will fit you in there regardless of whether you really belong there or not and I think we saw this over and over and over after d'amore with you know Trump and was the reaction to everybody who even sounded like they might vaguely support Trump or with brexit and everybody who sounded like they might even vaguely be sympathetic to brexit and so I realized we're not really living in a in a free speech society we're living in hegemony where journalists are doing this this ideological instruction and ideological capture and the only zones for freedom are the kind of IDW stuff or what you guys are doing YouTube I hope I hope YouTube stays relatively free and I mean what a again sort of coming back to the neurodiversity argument what I really love about that is that it reframes there's an ideological capture of the media as well did you get much pickup from it have you seen that argument getting much traction because it does seem that it's a very effective argument against the exclusion of certain voices in the media landscape yeah I think my neurodiversity he's got almost no traction precisely because it was a real good argument I think it would have been extremely awkward for journalists who read it and I know some read it to go oh my god the guys write existing speech codes are discriminatory I even did a follow-up piece called the cultural diversity case for free speech that was about how do you create let's say campus policies that are genuinely welcoming to grad students or faculty from other cultures Brazil China Iraq Japan whatever how do they come to America and actually learn what they're allowed to say can we perhaps provide a list to do topics that they can avoid can we give them good training for how to engage with American political arguments what's like okay here the the views in American society generally holds but here are the views on campus that you're only allowed to hold and that also I thought was a powerful argument it was also inclusive it was pro diversity it's like we should have grad students from other cultures we just shouldn't have a bait-and-switch where we go we're a free society oh wait but not about this issue because this is the paradox of the social justice left as well is that they love marginalized people poor people in the abstract but they actually hate their views yeah and it gets them into such an awkward corners it's almost hilarious like if you're teaching a human sexuality class and talking about meat choice and then maybe you have a young Indian woman in the audience say I'm married actually it was an arranged marriage my parents found my husband for him I didn't meet him until the day of the wedding and you know what we're really happy the American women had can't even process that like you're patriarch Ilia pressed because it was arranged but you're happy so it's okay so like it's a suitor - it's a pseudo diversity they want they don't actually want people from different cultures and lifestyles and mating conditions to actually speak up about their experience they want to just impose their a little worldview on everything that happens and to the extent that you know a student from India kind of buys into what they want then like your honorary American leftist and that's okay but if someone actually challenges what they're saying a their first instinct is ostracism and silencing and be they have no logical argument against a different culture you see there's quite a lot with the reaction to Coleman Hughes who's written quite a few pieces for Collette there's sort of this unspoken deal in these kind of social justice subcultures which is as a person of color you play a certain role and we will give you a hierarchical position but that role is to make us feel guilty about our white privilege it is to kind of to fit into a certain narrative and and there's a kind of devil's bargain there with with the people going into it but if that person refuses to play that game like Coleman Hughes for example with his pieces about Colette saying there are cultural reasons for black failure that are not entirely due to racism for example he they don't know what to do with it that someone as soon as someone comes up slips out of the script it's a very different conversation and no one really knows how to react yeah and that again you know illustrates that social justice left pays a lot of lip service to diversity but they they aren't actually capable of processing anybody with a kind of complicated patchwork of views you know maybe we we should step back from it and say maybe we don't want the social norms of communication to be set by a bunch of absurdly immature eighteen year olds like maybe they should actually respect people who have a little more life except instead of thinking well if it feels wrong to me I should protest it and shut them down [Music] you [Music]
