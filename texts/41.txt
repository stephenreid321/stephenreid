[Music] Tarson great to see you again yeah it's good to see you again David so just a little bit of backstory we've been putting out a few pieces recently with Brett Weinstein a lot to do with his discussion with Richard Dawkins in Chicago where he I think the consensus is that he certainly challenged Dawkins pretty solidly on his sort of new atheist dismissal of religion a lot of people seem to have been persuaded by that and then another couple of pieces as well where he was reflecting on the sam harris and jordan peterson debates i am really interested so often after that you got in touch with me to say let's catch up because i know we both think that this conversation is really really important and why did you get in touch what what what did you feel sort of watching those brett those interviews with brett well I think that the I think it's very anyway I'm very happy that that discussion with Dawkins happened but I think I'm left kind of a bit I would say not frustrated or feeling like this isn't going far enough and the sense that I get from Brett because I listened to the interviews that you did with him is the same impression that I got when I had a discussion with him in Vancouver about was a year and a half ago now um is that he views religion let's say as a series of heuristic formulations that you could call the rules that if you follow them then you have a better chance to survive let's say but I think what's missing is to understand just how deep religion what religion is addressing is not so much a bunch of rules but is rather structural that is it is it is representing the very structure of reality in the manner in which consciousness engages with reality and so it's a far deeper issue that's we're dealing with and so when I hear Rhett saying things like you know we can't rely on these old texts because you know they're all dated and they're talking about things that aren't relevant it's because he's looking at the surface rules he's looking at the surface details but he's not looking at the patterns of behavior and the patterns in the stories and in the rituals which are there to rather do things like establish space establish time establish hierarchy establish our relationships to others within a unity and so all of that is really what religion is dealing with I guess you'd you'd agree that he's going further than someone like Sam Harris was for example I think so I think that Brett is able to see at least the utility of religion or at least a utility that religion religion has had in the past and so that's kind of something that he wants to offer up to religious people hoping in a way that then religious people will feel less offended by evolutionary theory so I think that in a way he's kind of lending a hand out but there's something in the way that he lends his hand out that's also kind of condescending because he's saying you know religion is this but people who have thought deeply about and some people do think that it's true if you meet some common person on the street they might think some those types of things about religion just like if you ask them about evolution they'll have silly ideas about evolution the problem is that religion isn't isn't democratic there's something that is kind of the patterns in them although they can be discussed they're rather stable um and so I always get the feeling like no you're not you're not dealing with what it's really about which is this more structural element of human consciousness because what's really interesting is you posted on Facebook a clip from Jordan Peterson he was on the Dave Rubin show quite recently with Ben Shapiro and it was a brilliant clip and I'm gonna play it in a second and it was about five minutes or so where he talks about it's as if there's a structure underlying being and it's a brilliant enunciation of sort of a religious understanding of the world and you posted it and I think you said something like wow he goes deeper than he's ever gone before or something like that and I sent it to Brett because I talked to Brett quite a lot about these questions on an off-camera in Portland and said what do you make of this and Brett's pretty much said yeah I completely agree Jordan is pretty much supporting my position on this and so this is really fascinating you both had such a strong reaction or a different reaction to the exactly the same piece let's play it now and then we'll pick up off the back of that well so here's here's the idea and it bears on your question although I don't exactly know how it's as if there's a spirit at the bottom of things that is that is involved in the in the in the bringing to being of everything so like so for example people talk about evolution as a random process but that's not true it's not true the mutations are random but there's also a lot of sources other sources of genetic variant variation but the selection mechanisms are not random so now then the question is what are the selection mechanisms so I'm going to have to go a bunch of well here's one selection mechanism it's like so human females are very sexually selective that's why you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors so the male failure rate for reproduction is twice that of the females okay so the question is well how is it that males succeed differentially and the first answer is well females reject if human females reject but then the question might be well they reject on the basis of what and the answer is well it's something like competence and then the question is well how is competence defined and then the answer to that is well men put themselves in hierarchies and they vote on each other's competence and it's really counterintuitive in some sense from a evolutionary perspective because you'd have to ask yourself why would men put themselves in positions where they elevate some men in status and then give them a huge rep reductive advantage given that that's to their reproductive disadvantage in some sense ok and there are reasons part of that might be let's say you decide to follow the best leader in a battle well then you don't die like he might get all the women but you don't die so at least you're still in the game and it might be the same if you're following the greatest hunter and the greatest hunter wouldn't be the person who was best at bringing down the game it would be the person who is best at bringing down the game and sharing it and organizing the next hunt all of that right and so men will organize themselves into groups and privilege certain men and that puts them ahead in the reproductive hierarchy and so what that means to some degree is that there's a spirit of masculinity that's shaping the entire structure of human evolutionary history that's what that means and then I think okay well that might just be a biological epic phenomenon and so it would be a spirit that it's the spirit of positive masculinity that manifests itself across epochal ages millions of years perhaps and it actually has shaped our consciousness actually and so you can think about that as a figure and it would be the figure that emerges it's like it's like the it's like this it's like the essential spirit of all the great men who defined what greatness constituted that's a spirit okay now that's a purely biological explanation you could say well that's gone for all intents and purposes you might have an image of that built right into you even the sense that you can experience something divine and paternal might be merely a reflection of that evolutionary process so that would be a biologically reductive argument for the existence of what we experience as God but then there's another possibility too which is that that's actually reflective of a deeper metaphysical reality that has to do with the nature of consciousness itself and I would say that I think that's true is I believe the biological case and I believe the biologically reductive case but I don't think that exhausts it I think that there's a metaphysical layer underneath that that the bile or that the biology is a genuine reflection of and that's the sort of the macrocosm above and the microcosm below that we that we are really reflective including in our consciousness of something about the structure of reality itself and that might involve whatever whatever it is that God is I think that in the discussion that's been a that's been going along with Jordan and the new atheist and Jordan you know based on discussions that I have it privately with him I felt like this is something that he had never really said in public which he had enunciated in private think that he was tyent trying to deal with which is that he's been able to build this bottom up case for let's say the structures of religion or the idea of deities or the or the notion of the the Heavenly Father let's say he's been able to build it up and explain quite well how you know certain biological processes will lead to this this formulation or to these images but what he hasn't done so much when he was doing that there is to say the reason why those patterns brought about these images in the first place is because they necessarily have to be a representation of reality itself or at the reality to the extent that we can engage with it and so the notion is that the reason why this images pops up and comes up bottom-up is because it is participating ended up the structure of reality itself and so the image of of deities of deities or of God or of the transcendent they are capturing something about the manner in which reality works itself so that's why when we engage in those patterns in those structures that's why they then become a a way to make the dates for Humanity to thrive or for the human species to to continue I know if that makes sense well I mean the question that comes up I guess is that that may be true and I think I think in that he also says that the danger here is that you're explaining religion versus explaining religion away and I think Jordan in that clip says something about you can explain it this way it is a pattern of being that doesn't exhaust the possibility that there's a metaphysical structural there's a metaphysical aspect to it as well and I guess but the idea is that why is there this pattern of being that's what we got kind of come back to is that why does reality lay itself out this way why does and and he hits the nail right at the right place which is he talks about how it's basically the structure of consciousness so this hierarchy that this higher key that he sets up is the structure of consciousness and so that's why there are analogies that say between the hierarchy sets up in terms of this idea of the spirit of the Father which kind of rises up and manifests itself as this transcendent father and also it's an it's analogous to the idea of space which is you know you create a center of space and then you lay out a space around it the notion of a center of time around which a cycle will will then proceed and so all these are at the center of a community in terms of a chief or in terms of an ideal that everybody gathers around and creates unity around this this thing that is above them and so that this idea is that the reason why this is is because it's the shape of consciousness and consciousness becomes the analogy to the structure of the cosmos sets up where this are the way in which we interact with what causes the universe to exist if the idea is that the pattern is not arbitrary it has it's not it could not have been in another way it that's the pattern of reality but I mean I guess I can follow you up to a point my what I am wondering about is why is that specifically Christian in in that sense what do you are it's not specifically Christian it's not receiving Christian it all I think that all religions are addressing this mystery are dealing with this mystery in a way that's why there are so many analogies in in all the different religions that's why you know for example this idea of centered space this notion of centered time the idea of rituals of establishment are there in in all religions I think that in terms of Christianity would it let's say what it has offered is the let's say them this point or this this bringing it all together in the you know in the person of Christ but doing that in a manner which also brings it back into us which you know st. Paul talks about Christ in us that that's that that Christ has revealed to us the mystery hidden from the beginning of time which is Christ in you and so Christ also brings it into the the person and and so you have this possibility of participating in the life of God and so the idea most let's say even at the early stages of Christianity you know people like Justin Martyr talked about how Socrates how Plato were Christians before Christ in the sense that they they participated in the life of the low and so it's not a strange thing for Christians to believe that Christianity is kind of the is is is a combination of this story and so it's all religions somehow participate in that story hmm and you you've said before just before we started recording you think this is where this conversation needs to go I mean I've got a sense of there's a there's either an expansion of the word atheist to to say okay atheism doesn't mean believing in a God outside of space and time creating something but it could mean an imminent and in an imminent creative principle that that doesn't need to have a sort of religious substructure or do you not think that's possible well I think that the first thing that needs to happen is I think that atheism needs to grapple with classical theism needs to grapple not with kind of modern visions of kind of modern evangelical and modern fundamentalist thinking but needs to grapple with a more profound mystical vision of theism which is that it's not so much that we understand God as this being that's outside of the world who created it and almost like he's just this very very big invisible being who creates the world that is not what what traditional Christians believe they they believe that God is transcends all of creation because he's the source of all manifestation he's the he's the source of everything that happens but he's also within he's also the root let's say the ground of being you would say he's the root of all things that as they appear and then he's also hidden in each aspect of manifestation and so the logos is the purpose of things or the logos of things is hidden in all all manifestation without a center without a purpose without a logos the world doesn't exist and that's where we get into this idea of attention and the notion of you know this notion of salience and and this new kind of consciousness science which which notice is how in order for us to perceive something there needs to be kind of this coming together and just you know these these uh you know like for me to perceive a microphone there's some strange magical thing which needs me makes me capable of perceiving that all the parts of the microphone somehow cohere into something which is above all its parts that's actually a description of something that sank lights st. Maximus would talk about that hidden in all manifestation that all level is are these hidden sparks these hidden purposes that human consciousness engages with and the human being becomes the laboratory into which all of these things come together we're kind of co-creators we participate in the existence of the world through through through our capacity for logos and reason and and consciousness and in that conception is is God identified with the totality of everything or is it you know God God is God has to God has to both transcend everything but then also underlie everything and so it's not you the problem with talking about God is a totality of everything is a that it's it's kind of like this quantitative thing it's almost like you take the entire universe and that would be God but then how does that also come how does everything come into one how can you even say everything and so above that everything appears this infinite non sayable unmentionable possibility which is you know the divine essence or you know that I always say the infinite is the best way to talk about it and that's the highest vision of God in a kind of traditional theistic way in a vision and how do you think this conversation should move on well I think I think that there are two things first is exploring the place of consciousness and I really would wish I really wished and I think I've said this to you before I really wish that that salmon and Jordan when they talk could have talked more about consciousness because the the this notion that the world kind of that consciousness participates in the way the world lays itself out and that's our primary in your face let's say with the world before science let's say that science comes second the first interface we have with the world is this phenomenological reality of encountering the world and so plunging into that is what's going to help people understand what religion is talking about and it also helped people to demystify some of the language that religion uses because it's taking that point of view as being the first point of view and so you know like I always tell people it's like no matter what you say the Sun still rises in the morning and it still goes up into the into the sky and it sets at night and that's actually the most important part that the Sun has for you because that's how you settle your day that's how you your whole life is structured around the fact that this Sun gets up in the morning and so that reality that phenomenological reality is primary science actually comes second and I think that that's and and if you plunge into that phenomenological reality and the way the world lays itself out then all of a sudden let's say rituals of centeredness rituals of of things like communion things like sacred spaces will start to make sense because you'll see that without those things start to fragment and and and fall apart and that's what we're seeing in society today and so I think that that's the consciousness is the key and then also really going past this idea that religion is just a bunch of things that people need to do that it that although there it is part of religion but to understand how it is it is really a language and a way of being which which participates in the existence of reality that it's a very ancient understanding of how it is that things can be both multiple in one at the same time and how that actually happens I think I probably share with you a sense that what's needed is is certainly a renewal of a lot of values that we've lost and a lot of the sacred I have a sense that you would like to see a renewal of Christianity would that be be right or do you think that we need a new some kind of new spiritual or religious tradition that that kind of I can't really see like a real renewal of Christianity happening well all I can say is I think that it's very difficult to change the story we're in um I think that the chore the story will change there are some things which are kind of you could say providential in the sense that there are these these historical patterns that you can't change you can't you can't just decide that you're going to now let's say start a new spirituality you can do that people have done that we've seen it happen in the 20th century you know millions of time then it's participated in the fragmentation of Western society I think that to me until until the big change until the massive shift you know until what Christians gonna call the the return of Christ or this moment where everything's going to going to change and we don't know what that looks like it's a it's an imagistic story about you know the this thing that happens in the world which changes everything until that I think that to stay inside the story is the best is the best bet for us now and in all the efforts that have been put to to do something else have been subversive in my opinion mm-hmm and what does that mean studying inside the story well that means that means staying inside the Christian story you know for all its for all its messiness and for all its kind of dimming and it's kind of approaching a sunset I don't think that there's another story at least for Western culture right now I think that the two stories for Western culture have been Christianity and Judaism and I think that those those are there and and they're not they're they're not they're not going away until something massive happens and so and I know a lot of people might think that's odd that I would say that but I think that that it's when you start to understand that things unfold in these patterns and in a way we we have very little individual control over how those things unfold and we're playing out let's say the Christian story right now in the Christian story there is a a breaking apart it's part of the story there is a death it's the death of Christianity is part of the Christian story and so we're kind of going through that right now and I think it's inevitable and I respect people and I totally respect people who would say in the light of that that I would rather do my own thing let's say I understand that I respect that but I but I don't see another another true viable path let's say for the West besides that hmm I might be depressing for people to hear yeah I mean I think that's that's a very live conversation when a lot of people I speak to the need for a grand narrative what is the grand narrative is there the possibility of resurrecting a grand narrative I I have to say I'm skeptical that that can be Christianity given the fact that we have sort of seemed to have decisively left it behind at least we're a lot less religious I think in the UK than you guys or you're not in the States but they make or at least yeah but I think that that is the key question it's like what does the grand narrative look like how do we recover some of these timeless truths and can it be done within a context that looks different from how it's been done in the past but it will have a lot in common with it I mean it will have to have a lot in common with it but then again I also come back to the fact that Christianity has accreted this immense depth and wisdom over such a long period of time that the idea that we can sort of come up with something off the caf seems pretty unrealistic at the same time yeah I mean I think that that's why I talk about kind of Providence you won't understand what I mean by that but in the sense that something has to happen it's it's not it's not just like it's really not just that we can decide to change the story there there is something there's a deep shift that needs to to occur for the story to change and it's something that we as individuals just as individual we can participate in that ship but as individuals we don't have that much power to actually affect you know this this story that's it's going on so that's kind of how I see it and I think what's going to happen I think that if I want to come back to the to the problem of a Brett and the problem of where the discussion needs to go one of the one of the difficulties that the reason why I also wanted to go back to consciousness is because there is I think in the way that Brett talks about it and this is what I brought up in our discussion the first time we talked is is that he takes for granted the position like he takes for granted his moral landscape he he thinks it's obvious that we should act in certain ways and and he doesn't have he doesn't have a he just takes it for granted we don't know what the source of that is we don't know what the source of his direction is he says he's a liberal he's obviously left-leaning and so it seems to come from that side let's say but there's another side right there's another side which is the the the right wing and those right may people also have their there um let's say their priorities and so to think that it's just obvious it's not if it was obvious there wouldn't be this clash and there wouldn't be this discussion it isn't obvious and so unless we do find a common narrative then those two opposites like I've been saying forever are just going to manifest themselves again and we're going to have the same clash we had you know at the beginning of the modern age you know right now we're just surfing we're just surfing let's say the it's horrible to say that we're cut we're kind of surfing the Holocaust like the Holocaust was such a shock you know that we're kind of we're still in awe from that and we're just we're just kind of surfing the end of that wave and we're reaching the end of what that it's a shock could could afford us and now we're once again seeing the same same story happen again and and unless unless people find a grounding and the grounding isn't just a bunch of morality like I said but he's really is is rediscovering the notion of what makes a center what makes what makes something exist what is you know how does time work how does consciousness engage with the world I asked before where you think this conversation goes I was kind of thinking about the sense that Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had these very public events that went some distance but didn't as far as some people hoped in terms of coming to a bit of a conclusion or pushing the debate forward enough who do you think are the right people to be having those kind of debates to push it forward well I think that I think that the discussion that Jordan had with Ben I think that those are the discussions that are going to attract a lot of attention because they're diving into the the crux of the matter in terms of how do we find a coherent set of values and how do we establish you know how do we establish something which is coherent like how do we bring things together so I think that that's why that that conversation attracted a lot of attention and I think that that's the the future I think that the fact that you're talking you know on your channel that you're talking to like Zen masters and you're talking to people that are both in the let's say in the secular world but are also engaged in religious traditions I think that that's the best way to go about there's a there's a fear that I have in terms of this intellectual dark web phenomena is that it's kind of catalyzing itself where you basically have all kind of secular atheist types and then you have bench Pierrot who's kind of like the the exception so so I think that if we broaden the discussion to involve more more people like Dave Rubin is talking to Bishop Baron from California who's a who's an excellent person who really understands kind of Christian ontology and the metaphysics of Christianity those types of discussion I think widening it out so that so that there is more of this discussion between the more rationalists and the scientists and kind of spiritual tradition I think I think that that's the key to to coming to something that has more more depth let's say because I guess that's the point I was I was thinking about is that I mean even with with Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson they're both coming from religious tradition so it's not like I guess what I'm saying is where's the open-minded religious person and the open-minded atheist that can come together and and one could potentially change the other's mind and come to some kind of synthesis that maybe Jordan peanuts and Sam is one table to come to I think you'd be surprised I think that I think that they're quite people like Paul van der clay for example is someone who there are some things that he won't budge on let's say some some basic tenets that he won't I don't think he would budge on but you know like even myself I came into this discussion with Jordan you know several years ago thinking that science was not let's say not and not particularly appreciating the way that science was totalizing the discourse and and feeling like like they were missing out on on you know the highest thing and so then in my discussion through Jordan I've discovered the science of consciousness I discovered you know how evolutionary psychology can talk about these things and different with different angles and so I felt like my position has changed quite a bit in appreciating let's say the role that scientific inquiry can play right now and so I think that there's quite a people quite a few people that actually would be able to have these discussions the the question is also one of the problems with it the intellectual dark web right now is that it's also a high profile game where it's only people who have a certain let's say visibility that are able to have the high level discussions and it's not always the case that those who have the highest visibility are the ones who are the most interesting and the most let's say proficient in what they're supposed in what they're talking about so let's say well should our audience for checking out well I think that people who want to at least understand Christianity I think that Bishop Baron is someone who is definitely interesting there's a writer his name is David Bentley Hart I think that a lot of he's a bit he's a bit abrasive because he doesn't like New Atheists but he does talk about he wrote a book recently called experiencing God which talks about the relationship between consciousness and our experience of the divine and how the those two are structured alike and so there are writers like that David Lee Hart is definitely someone I would encourage people to look into great jónasson been a real pleasure again speaking to you until next time thanks till next time [Music] you [Music]
