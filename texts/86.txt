so this is the latest rebel wisdom podcast an exciting one because this morning I did an interview with Jordan Peterson which is the second interview that I've done and the first time I've seen him since I saw him last October which we then turned into the documentary truth from the time of chaos and then glitch in the matrix so yeah really exciting - yes I sort of see where he's at and obviously the kind of trajectory that he's been on since then has just been so exponential and yeah I was really pleased with like we talked about sort of being a bit concerned he was getting burnt out and didn't get a sense of that at all from from meeting him it was really yeah he was on good form and I think we got some really really interesting stuff and we're going to play some of it in this podcast referring specifically to the Sam Harris debates because that just happened and yeah so he's done four four debates with Sam Harris now - in Vancouver one in Dublin one in London on the subject of religion versus atheism and the other thing is to kind of look forward to what else is coming up we just come back from the u.s. we've got a huge amount of content some really exciting stuff we just put out an interview with Paul van der clay the kind of pastor from Sacramento who's becoming kind of a little mini online celebrity because it was commentaries on Jordan Pederson and one person commented the pastor of the IDW Paul van der clay officially the pastor of the IDW congratulations Paul it's now official three YouTube comments making the same one makes it actually official so good so yeah Sam Harris and Jordan Pederson so I haven't been to any of these debates and but we've listened someone's very sneekly put some of the audio online so I've listened to some of the stuff in Vancouver and some of the stuff from from London a couple of nights ago and we've also commented quite like we've been interested ourselves and kind of this interplay between like we've said quite a few times for for me for you I think as well John and Peter Som represents a kind of potential reintegration of the sacred grounding in neuroscience grounding it in mythology and it's clear that Sam Harris is very sort of the irony is they're both within this kind of loose collective called the IDW but they've clearly got very different perspectives which I guess is why so many people have gone to see them talk over the last kind of four days from me you know equally listening to the kind of the bootlegged stuff and kind of engaging with the debates there is a sense of something new happening in the sense that the traditional kind of new atheist argument has this real focus on religion almost as a political force and the kind of irrationality of it and all of that but some of which I can engage with some of which I would even you know agree with but what Peterson seems to be bringing and what these debates are kind of exploring is a different kind of exploration of maybe what we call the religious impulse rather than looking specifically at religion but taking that deeper level and looking at the impulse within us as you know the biological historical cultural impulse in us which is so deep to be religious creatures and I you know I feel like Jordan Peterson it's coming or or reintroducing that into the culture and Sammis is holding a different piece which is a kind of warning against the fundamentalism that can come about with religion which is a fair warning definitely but the paradox that we're going to explore is that that kind of viewpoint in itself we could call scientism is in danger of becoming a fundamental fundamentalism itself it's not already if not already and this is something we're going to explore so we're going to play a clip now the first one of first questions I asked Peterson Peterson about this which was started by talking about the IDW which we'll put out at some future time but the what a lot of people are sensing from the IDW why it's sort of quite kind of intellectually dark web for any of that people haven't been watching our other stuff is there's a sense of they're asking really big questions and there's some really big ideas and great thinkers in it but ultimately what I think people are tuning into is a sense of people thinking in public and a sense of this is what it looks like for two people to engage in a generative dialogue around different ideas and one that sort of builds so so yeah that's that was the starting point of this question that we're going to roll now there's a kind of intellectual curiosity and a sense of people thinking in public and and there's also a sense of maybe the potential for people to change their minds or to discover things during the conversation well that's partly the appreciation of the intelligence of the audience it's like and I would say it is actually the manifestation of the process of thinking that's more important than the conclusions that are generated even in these discussions that I've been having with Harris like we are trying to to argue out to different viewpoints because Harris believes that values can be derived with with with unerring precision in some sense using the proper methodology from facts and I I believe that it's more complicated than that that there has to be intermediating structures and those are really narrative in in their nature so there's a technical argument as well as a variety of sub arguments about the relative role of traditional religion and so forth but the outcome of the debate about those issues is partly what people are coming to the talks to see to determine what should the conclusions be but a much larger part perhaps is to in to observe and engage at least by proxy in the process of dialogue and that's more important because dialogue is the process by which complex problems are solved which is what makes me a free speech advocate fundamentally was not an advocate it's like I realized that that the protection for free speech is protection of the mechanism whereby complex social problems are solved and were were the people in this group and many other people as well are acting out that biological process and and people are happy about that as they should be based on what Jordan Peterson was just saying and then also listening to the pod sort to the debate what really struck me was was one particular moment when Sam Harris mentioned you know talks about the mystical or I don't think he would refer to this mystical experiences but the deep experiences he's had through Buddhism and I believe psychedelics as well and then he kind of makes a comment around yeah but I wasn't sort of Marshall tol'able was the word but something around that I wasn't kind of gullible enough to kind of attribute that to something other than the workings of my own mind and then Peter says it says you need to take a bigger dose and sir it's a great moment in the debate as well and it really you know even though it's kind of a fun moment it also points to maybe for me one of the deepest aspects of this because in the debate I get a sense that Harris his his understanding or his model of religion that he's putting out is one which is very much the structured religions and Andrew Sweeney in a recent piece on rebel wisdom he mentioned that this model of a God with like a bearded man in the sky that the kind of atheist tend to use is not really the religious understanding of the model of God that people who for whom religion is important part of their lives use no one who's serious about religion believes that type of model at all and that's that's an interesting thing for me because it gets back to that point of there's a difference between the internal experience we have the internal religious experience which is about experiencing the transcendent it's not believing in anything it's no belief there's no space for belief it's you have an internal experience that is that is religious drive and that is the religious experience I think Harris is absolutely right in the sense that you cannot take that experience I can't have some deep psychedelic experience if you like David I've just figured out that everyone's we're actually earth isn't earth we're actually all sitting on a massive green elephant and I really need everyone to know this so we have really going to put this out there you can't do that because science is the language we use for you and me to agree on what we can both agree on like look through this telescope what do you see okay well I have a hypothesis about it well you're gonna try and disprove my hypothesis until we reach a synthesis where we can be reasonably like really really sure about what's in that telescope so those two things they can't cross over and the integral studies as big on this they can't cross over but they can coexist so finally the Petersons point around its the discourse that's in a sense more important that really connected with me when he when he says that because they could do a thousand debates and they are never ever going to solve this the science versus spirituality thing yeah I mean listening to the recent one at the o2 you get the sense oof and I guess you've got the sense since Peterson and Harris started talking that they're talking past each other yeah and you frequently hear Sam accusing Jordan of not answering the question and it's interesting listening to that because I didn't get that sense that Jordan was him was avoiding the question like it's interesting I mean I probably listen to a lot of Jordan Peters and stuff and listen to quite a lot of sam Harris's stuff as well like I've got a lot of respect for the waking up podcast there was a spectator article this morning really good spectre article maybe we'll link to it under this where the writer was saying he he thinks Jordan Pederson has a bigger view than sam Harris that he understands Sam Harris's perspective better than Sam Harris's understands Jordan Peterson's perspective now I think that's true obviously we've we've done a lot of stuff about Jordan Peterson and just a point we did actually ask if sam Harris would be available for an interview while he was here in London but he wasn't because I'd love to put some of this stuff to him so Sam if you're watching we'd love to interview you give you a chance to respond and but I but I did get the sense that there was a frequent kind of reducing to caricature by Sam Harris that I didn't think I didn't get that feeling from Peterson Peterson staff is a huge amount of his his comments with yes yes but like including like he includes a lot of what sam says sam kind of seems to continually reduce it down to the material or to the human and peterson says yes and which which is really interesting because we talk about integral theory quite a lot in the whole idea is yes and peterson seems to be yes handing sam harris an awful lot he's saying to sam harris is saying we'll hang on are you saying that this was divinely inspired how can you tell you that this book was divinely inspired and peterson is saying well we don't know where creativity comes from that in some sense creativity comes from somewhere we don't understand and if you take creativity over millenia where things are refined and refined and refined what is kept of that particular story has to reflect something has to reflect some kind of divine reality or what it has to reflect some kind of reality which you can choose to call divine or not and Sam continued kind of just brings it back to know this is just people's imagination or just this this is just so I do feel yeah very frequently the Peterson takes does understand that incorporates Sam Harris's reductive world view but frames it within something more and yeah I think that's a good point another thing that struck me somehow it actually makes a really good point towards the end of the last debate where he says look he starts talking about consciousness and our understanding of what consciousness is and he said you know that could've been a place we started this particular debate and they may well have covered that in the in the first two I'm not sure if as I've seen them but that is I think a really key question because there's you know we talked about the soft problem of consciousness and the hard problem and the soft problem is effectively how is our neurobiology involved in how we perceive the world and that's soft because we can do brain scans and we can look at it and we can you know we can experiment back and that out pretty much the hard problem is what is consciousness and you know is it local or non-local as in is consciousness a quality of the universe which is everywhere and we happen to be recipients of that really yeah pantheism effectively or is it specifically just in the human mind you know all of that question that has not been answered yet and it also there is a sense that it can't be answered yeah so and this is this is where I keep coming back to the the sort of my real frustration with the more strict strict materialist types because you can't have a worldview that says well we understand pretty much everything apart from consciousness like okay so you can understand absolutely everything apart from the thing that's experiencing absolutely everything that's a pretty big hole in your theory and to maintain this kind of very dogmatic materialism without accepting that this is you you're like okay just give me that one miracle of the fact that we can experience anything and then I'll explain everything it's like no sorry you're you're asking for a it's a different kind of because they argue that religion is sort of miraculous or magical thinking it's like no actually you've got a magical thinking going on as well just the same as believers yeah that's that's a good point as well and and not just the magical thinking but also the the dangers of dogmatism that can come about not talking about some heresy necessarily just that what my experience of very extreme materialists because I'm one of the organizers of breaking convention of psychedelics conference and that is possibly the main tension of that conference is we have neuro scientists and we have I guess Psychonauts and explorers and artists and poets and all sorts and the tension is between the materialist worldview and one which is more centered on the phenomenology of the experience and mystery and faith not faith isn't quite the right word but the religious experience let's call it and I noticed what I pick up from the extreme materialists is a value system in which internal experience and the claims or the the value of internal experience is lower than the value of scientific reason always that those two things there now I think they should be on equal footing but in different domains and serve different roles but the smugness and the snide miss comes I think from partly from that value structure yeah I think this is a good place to start the the second Jordan Pederson clip because yeah I think it talks to this sort of potential dogmatism on the materialist side as well so roll number two I read The Spectator review of your recent conversation I think you've now come to the end of your debates for Sam Harris and they said that you expressed a little bit of irritation at some of the when Sam didn't grass some of the points that you were making or that you didn't fully appreciate that he'd and understood them I also think that Sam Harris in particular like he's built a whole kind of personality career several books on this atheism position do you think that he can argue in good faith from that perspective could he turn around and say well actually no you're right Jordan this atheism thing is it I think he was I think he was I think he was conducting the discussion in good faith I actually think that what Sam is doing is a good-faith project you know he I think there's conceptual muddiness about it but you know his basic premise is that we could come to an agreement that working to reduce unnecessary misery and suffering is a universal good okay fair enough that seems like a reasonable proposition I don't think it's a proposition of fact and he claims that it is but that doesn't matter still it's fair enough then and then you know so that's one proposition another proposition is it would be really good if our systems of value weren't founded on air and what do we have that's not air well we have facts we have objective facts I mean look at the technology look at what we've done with our science it's like you don't want to underestimate the utility of objective facts so maybe we can ground the value structure in the facts it's like well that would be good if we could do it so and and so and then he his ethic let's say is an amalgam of those two propositions and I think that his project is honorable and and and I think he's committed to it he also rightly is concerned with the dangers of the fundamentalist dangers of revealed truth and so is very skeptical about about the axiomatic claims of dogmatic religion it's like yeah fair enough but his the mechanisms that he outlines to derive values from facts are insufficient in my estimation I don't think that his argument is sufficiently sophisticated even though I don't doubt it's I don't think that Sam is any less committed to an ethical good it's not obvious to me that he is than I am you know and he's argued and discussed fully in good faith as far as I'm concerned you know with the with the odd error because no one is negotiating 100% all the time in good faith I mean that's a standard that no one can can achieve but I think the discussions have been unbelievably productive and and we'll see that certainly the crowds are responding I don't think the crowds would have been engaged if Sam wouldn't have been wouldn't been discussing in good faith you know because the engagement is actually an indication that a good faith discussion is is occurring otherwise it gets dull very very rapidly we'll see what happens when the videos are released and that'll be in August once there the sound is edited and all of that and and then people will have a public debate about how it how the discussion proceeded I also think that each discussion built on the previous one and that we both ended up I think we both ended up more informed and more articulate than we started out so that's a good that's a really good thing I certainly understand his arguments much better than I did well a year ago let's say I think that exchange kind of illustrates the point that I made I mean like they asked him whether sam harris was arguing in good faith because if i mean if you look at it from this perspective look sam house is written like two or three books on atheism he is one of the most kind of noted celebrate' celebrity atheists with possible exception richard dawkins so he had a huge amount professionally at stake so i guess my question about good faith was is it possible for him to change his mind and i was kind of looking yeah i really didn't know what what jordan would say about that i had a sense that yeah that there was some irritation sometimes in the way sam was kind of caricature or or minimizing some of the things that he was saying so i was genuinely interested in whether he thought that and genuinely kind of yeah really interested in his response which i kind of found to be like that there's a this fan seemed to me to be a lot of generosity in there it's like we all really value sam's project i think it's really good and a lot of honesty about where he sees and conceptual modernist and and all the rest of it but the interesting thing for me is reading below the comments on the leaked the recently leaked talk from london and I've seen this a few times like the Matt Dillahunty talked with Peterson as well I find this the material the sort of atheist types to be far more dismissive of Peterson Oh Sam destroyed Peterson Peterson's avoiding arts answering the question all of this I find them far more dismissive of Peterson that I hear Peterson being a Paris or generally Peterson's fans being of Harris which is interesting it kind of speaks to what we said before the danger of a dogmatism in the Atheist camp that can become a kind of new religion yeah and as you're saying that I'm something came up for me which I thought in the past which is when atheism does go that far and it won't be all of his supporters but it'll be you know some there is that strand in the world when it does it becomes a religion in a sense based on being able to control everything there's there's a real sense of that for me because you know Peterson in that clip talked about it will be good if our values weren't based on air and that really stuck with me I was like hmm but going back to that sense of we don't know where creativity comes from we don't we don't know just that with respect for the mystery respect for the mystery and the ego really doesn't like letting go into a mystery you know that's that's part of the inside of a lot of the Eastern traditions as well so that kind of strikes me as an interesting point because I mean to be honest the irony is the the pre-socratic philosophers they were getting their information Parmenides and pedak Li's they were receiving their wisdom which became logic from mysterious kind of transcendent experiences so we have based our values to a degree on what they might call err but that that's concept they might see as air is actually something potentially very different I would see it as something potentially very different that it has substance in it that there is some substance that arises up that might be the root of creativity or you know whatever else we don't know but that sense if we don't know there's a humility in map and there's not very much humility in we do know when it's just a matter and anything we don't know it's just a matter of time till we figure it out with science yeah because that's something that I've thought as well it's like at some point your axioms have to be or not have to be that your axioms are based on something irrational you cannot rationally derive axioms so the idea that we can be purely rational at some point you are making a leap of faith you cannot avoid making a leap of faith it's like what is your what is your leap of faith going to be what are your original axioms going to be you have to kind of at some point assume some things and so what are those things and what was really interesting as well in the in the o2 debate one of the things Douglas Murray said which was what we're seeing in the world seems to be that when you remove religion people will make new religions out of anything and I think we're seeing this particularly on the left at the moment sort of like the whole equality diversity what you might call didn't call SJW thinking or has become a new religion I think we're all kind of this is there's there's a really real dogmatism that seems to have arisen that that is replacing the the old religious stories and obviously also kind of returning us to group identity and the danger of that in terms of the sovereignty of the individual and all of that which which I talked about with Jordan Peters in quite a bit more will have coming up in one of our future future videos what was also reminded of there's a great line one of the guys that we interviewed in America talked about so scientism is this kind of worldview that sort of sees Sciences as the guys in their white coats the new religion the guys and their white coats and it happens at the very subconscious level it's like you use scientific validation to to support something like oh the benefits of meditation oh it's a dairy fairy thing no now that mindfulness and we have these studies and Dadda Dadda Dadda suddenly it disease yeah it's the new priesthood in many many ways but he had this great line which was scientism is more dangerous than jihadism because at least you have ism how doesn't create nuclear bombs science scientism has all of the technologies or AI or any of these things if you divorce science from any kind of ethical and moral responsibility and it's clearly not obvious as peterson says how you reintroduce it once you've once you've got rid of it era seems to think that you can so this is a crucial crucial question once you've removed kind of the ethical grounds which we could argue Rupert Sheldrake and one of our videos argued they're ultimately Christian in origin but this ethical basis that you take is self-evident sam harris is actually based in a heart whole christian story that's acted out through our actions and through our assumptions and it's it's a judeo-christian worldview you get rid of that and you don't get an emergent morality you get science torn free of emergent morality and that as yeah that is a terrifying prospect yeah definitely and i murray makes a really good i thought that was a really good point by murray is round that those new religions that we're seeing effectively which are kind of ideological kind of semi strange political sjw style religions and and on both sides in fact it's like they're not based on what's come before they're those the pp says the people who are doing that they don't know what their ancestors created before that is trying to create this split and build something on foundations that don't really exist and that's that's quite a strong argument for really engaging in religion and seeing how these systems have survived for so long and what tenants they hold which is another subtlety which was in the debate around religion as a political institution organized religion which I would be with Sam Harris on around the massive problems with that and religion as Jordan Peterson talks about it which is like looking at the deep archetypal truth that exists within it which which doesn't really cross over necessarily with you know the Spanish Inquisition or what the Catholic Church is up to in a certain country yeah yeah and as Peterson says Sam Harris in his books and his lectures doesn't grapple with Dostoyevsky doesn't grapple with Nietzsche doesn't grapple with these thinkers who wrestled with the human condition and often resorts to a caricature of religion that most religious people don't believe yeah so Sam if you're watching and you want to respond to any of this you're more than welcome your publicist of my details so yeah let's let's look forward to what we've got coming up and really exciting like I was I was very taken with some of Peterson's answers today particularly about the relationship between the individual and collective identity in the left which I've never heard him mate before and this I think will be the centerpiece of what we're looking to do next week because there's a I've seen a few people on the left now really grappling with Jordan Peterson in a kind of sense of what does the left have to learn from Jordan and that seems new to me for a while it felt like most of there's obviously the radical death which hates women and there's a kind of it there's the sort of the soft left which is really unsure about him and I had a sense for a while that they were just wanting him to go away and he hasn't been hey so now the sense is okay and it's quite a brave thing for people on the left to be doing that because there's he's obviously quite a kind of kind of polarizing figure and an hated figure by some area of the left so I would have kind of acknowledged the bravery of the people on the Left who are engaging with his thought and what we want to do next week is a whole series of programs looking at what can the left learn from Jordan Peterson yeah and I think it's a really good timing I've noticed that sense of something shifting on the left around identity politics in particular and the left kind of sorting its house out and then last night there's a now quite viral tweet of Barack Obama talking about effectively the dangers of identity politics and specifically using Mandela as an example of someone who was able to transcend that learned Afrikaans in prison really you know challenging and just disputing this idea of like oh if someone's you know for example white and male they can't possibly understand you or you know just bringing back empathy so Barack Obama bringing that into the into the conversation I think that's quite a big moment so I think there is a kind of shift happening and it's a good time great and any housekeeping we've got a we've now launched our podcast yes so our podcast is also now available on Spotify so type in rebel wisdom it's the one with our logo not the one with one podcast in February with a completely different logo you can listen to that but um haven't heard of it yet so yeah rebel words of us on Spotify it's on pod bean will put all the information down in the show notes as well and subscribe to the channel so that you can be kept in the loop of the other Jordan Pederson clips which would be probably coming up next week and the whole series about Jordan Peterson on the left and this could have interesting crux point that we seem to be out in the conversation around ident politics if you've enjoyed this and want to help us make more films please consider sponsoring us on patreon again the details are beat down there in the show notes see you next week
