[Music] Jordan Peterson psychologist philosopher and now pop star the tragedy I've made a couple of documentaries about Jordan Peterson including glitch in the matrix you keep him from where I came in from London last night then I discovered someone had done a musical remix of it brink of the frames they'll be put to the major break break of the French there's a bunch of the major break break of the French there's a glitch in the matrix a DJ based in LA a cure of the dawn a week later he happened to be in London this is our talk when you're making music and writing and stuff oftentimes you quote the Great's and you know you quote a hunter s Sampson are you quote young or whatever but they're all dead you know knew they didn't they were audio if there are audio recordings of them they're not very good and there aren't that many of them and here we have Peterson like spitting fucking napalm on a daily basis like dropping like an hours of audio every day it's all fucking brilliant it all incredibly quotable and it's also incredibly sonorous musical and beautiful and important and necessary right now if I did nothing else in my life even if I didn't even eat I could just sit there making Peterson music forever so it's been a bit of a roller coaster journey like I put out the glitch in the matrix documentary and then Jordan Pederson got in touch to say do you mind if I put it on my youtube channel is that how that happens yeah then it kind of raced to about 400,000 views in a couple of weeks and then I found this remix of a glitch in the matrix before he posted it by the way oh well that was I did that a good couple of weeks before and it was fantastic I was very excited when I found it I actually stopped what I was doing I normally get up have a steak go into the studio and I got up and I was a salting my steak and I that came up in my YouTube thank you to the YouTube algorithms I'll get into this in a bit but I put it on and then ended up just watching the whole thing rather than going straight to the studio and it was fantastic and I knew immediately that I wanted to do something with it musically which are not done before was normally I find sort of pieces of audio to tell a whole story that I already want to tell or what-have-you but you'd basically done something that I wanted to do and you'd done it perfectly so it was like okay I just need to get the right music for this and it'll be a wonderful useful thing yeah because I first saw it and I thought oh wow someone's put a backing track to the documentary and I thought that's pretty cool but then I watch it I was like no there's some real production skill in here [Music] yeah that's been that's been the reaction all over I think that was Peterson's reaction he was instantly like thought this was gonna be silly and was mute and then was like oh this is actually artful and I were now it's actually proving useful and that's generally the reaction from people came to the memes stayed for the amazingness or whatever you think it's gonna be silly and they did it and then it has silliness about it I suppose but it actually works on a on many levels silly without the fingers with that is I pretty much know almost instantly as well what this sort of sonic palette was which was this sort of sci-fi dystopian vapour trap synth thing which is quite specific and then it's a case if you like my themes you know them fix with your voice and it fits with the Britishness that comes to it there's particularly now I've been away for three and a half years and I came back and things are very disturbing it's like it's like a kind of a ZZZ BBC drama of the future aesthetic has become the truth this idea we used to have of what the future might be like if things went a bit wrong but you're living in America so you've got your own dystopian fantasy to worry about the American dystopian fantasy is kind of sort of a Technicolor almost Jack Kirby kind of like pop art thing and the British one is this kind of like grim it's like the more sort of George Orwell I guess oldest Huxley yeah Huxley had it completely right but it's it's like it's a lot like the movie of V for Vendetta being away for three and a half years coming back it looks and sounds and feels like that yeah he has really yeah basically basically it's like him in Grant Morrison it's kind of the Orwell and Huxley thing you have these two ideas and they're both kind of right although I would say brave new world has thus far turned out to be a more accurate representation but we don't get sexy drugs we've got technology we have two we have the the cocaine rush of the facebook-like versus actual good drugs that was one thing I was disappointed lots of the future has come to pass in a way that I hoped it would but drugs in the future of rubbish terribly now you've just got this little dopamine rush of a light and that's yeah that's how drug nowadays yes there's a little coke bump and people the actual drugs people take like government versions of drugs we had in the 60s so like government speeders in the shape of adderall and government cocaine and government what would he call xanax smack government smack is the grip drug of choice for the youth of today which is a very depressing state of affairs you might as well stay indoors like harvesting likes yeah anyway where were we yeah glitch yeah the beautiful beautiful glitch the beautiful vapor trap which and yes so one has to find a musical sort of tone an aesthetic and then one has to make it work harmoniously and key you scoring the thing here but it also has to kind of go on the emotional journey and kind of hit the points and sort of accentuate what's already there a lot of the effect of these things is subconscious you know I don't want it to be people sometimes hit me up in like are you should do or achieve Fingal you should do like the caffeine oom and like remix and make it you know make it a big banging trap thing or something but there's lots of people doing silly things like that on YouTube I'm trying to do something a lot more subtle so it's a case of just slightly retiming the speaking so that it's in time with the music cutting out homes and ours and things of that nature occasionally repeating things for emphasis and occasionally like just timing you know timing retiming and things of that nature makes you really appreciate peterson even more he's very easy to work with as his voice is an instrument because he speaks very deliberately and sonorous ly and rhythmically anyway he actually speaks in in a kind of form of rhythmic poetry sometimes he is actually rapping you don't really need to do that much retiming on him sometimes and you've got like bits of a rap song he just does that nationally and then other people don't necessarily do that you'll you will feel very good as you don't do but you know you've you've got a training so you're not humming an aria and what have you some of these subjects of your film did require a lot of tidying up to get the more musical nature of what they were doing and some less so communal package is very funny I'd wanted to do something with her icon I imagined she'd be like a speed garage oh she's brilliant and I've been running I was thinking of doing a mini package away of anyway she talks about aesthetics a lot it's just like perfect for that world I don't how much you know about that but aesthetics is aesthetic is a big part of the vaporwave think it's almost the core of it it's the aesthetic I don't really know what vaporwave is I saw that on your on your bio you'd like it it's it's it's ironic some have pointed out to use it well use aspects of it because it's postmodern music and this original idea was a postmodern idea in her a lot of it was used to sort of its attack capitalism or at least make statements about capitalism and vacuous Ness of modern culture and stuff but it's involved so initially it would take a bit of music and sort of slow it down and loop it forever for like eight minutes like a bit of a Diana Ross song or something you sort of slow it down and then loop it and sort of drag out the pathos from the thing and you would twin that with visuals and the visuals would be like sort of pink and blue and Evian Wars of bottles a bit of a wind 95 logo or something call these like bits of our culture that kind of sort of could be interpreted as sort of dead and purely caps a list with unsold us but then that created a whole subculture if then it creating brilliant music as these things always do my take on it was fusing it with a low fire hip-hop and some other things I like liked rap and contemporary sort of music production ideas to create soundscapes of depth and length when I first came across it I assumed that you were American yes and it ironically I didn't really put this into the glitch documentary so much but a lot of what I was talking to Peterson about with synchronicities yes synchronicities are like meaningful coincidences that seems somehow to be related to the structure of being and then I saw your remix of the documentary and then you happen to be coming to the UK for the first time for two weeks after this yes I've been here three and a half years but though Here I am and here you are of course these things always happen Grant Morrison would say we did say that the first step to becoming he's a chaos magician as well as a writer and the first step to becoming a magician is to knows his synchronicity you start noticing that and the more you notice them the more they occur yeah it's kind of you're you're aware of the fabric of being Muhammad Malcolm X said when you're noticing synchronicities you're walking with Allah was his thing on that so you know as it's always been that way whenever I'm doing anything in life that's correct and I find I am on the correct path and you know when you're on the correct path then you know his synchronicities all over the place and some would say that that's proof that we're living in a simulation and some would say that's proof of God and there's many people have all sorts of thoughts about this but all the the observable fact is that when one is observing these things like meaning becomes ever more apparent and the worth of what you're doing becomes ever more apparent and then it just spawns more stuff interesting that you say as well that Peterson has a very musical or a very performative aspect to his speech because that also ties into that's what I really like about his his philosophy is that he talks about performing that performance or aligning yourself with the truth and if you're aligning yourself with the logos of the creative principle you would expect to be for that to have an effect on your actual performance but he feels like a very embodied speaker when he's on stage like he's fully inhabiting the stories that he's that he's telling and that that performative aspect of it is seems to me at least also related to what he's talking about the logo of something incarnated more in your life and incarnate and more in your in your being yes and watching him become that over the years because he was not always as as confident and able to just now you know you freestyles right he's his whole career yes all careers really reminded me of it's very $0.50 for example got big off the back of drama there was created drama you know beefs with other rappers and being shot 13 times and all this stuff which draws people into the story but then he had this huge body of work and that kept people there Peterson did this Peterson had these public dramas and that brought people to him but then when they got to him they there was this huge body of work for them to get sort of lost and immersed in it Peterson has some kind of drama like every week at this point he's like the ultimate sort of contemporary battle rapper he's at war with all sorts of people at all times it's it's brilliant very interesting and if you're inside you know if you're a rap fan or if you're a what would you call if you're a intellectual dark or whatever the hell it is fat it's like this guy's getting incredible beefs every week right and there's a new sort of super villain to root against every week three guards to him or if you're on his side or not you know it's the whole thing's very entertaining but then he pulls you in and then there's all this meaning and this huge body of work but he's quite new on this lake if you watch him like 15 years ago it was a bit awkward and sort of he was very charming and he knew what he was talking about but the absolute fucking beast that he has become as a performance creature who can now just rock up at an amphitheatre and just like freestyle the new to our lecture off the top of his head and he's very into not repeating himself too much in his lake you go see a standard chameleon you'll see pretty much the same set every week for like a year or something he won't do that he's more like a very good DJ you know he has all these yes like a fistful of things that you know his works together and they're linked and he can take you on these different journeys but depending on who's in the room and where he is he will create a new and transformative always experience yeah and he also describes that as a dialogue even if it's Oh even if he's the only one speaking he's speaking deliberately and if you watch some of the lectures in his classroom you'll see him pick out one person at a time to speak to and then he'll change what he's saying based on their facial reaction as their response if he says something that's a little bit too much you can see him correcting himself in the moment or adding a bit more context so it is very live yeah I'm a very good DJ and if you're a very good DJ that's exactly what you do you don't just go in there and like play thirty records in a sequence that you've already preordained you go in there and you you have some idea of where you want to go and maybe where you want to end up taking these people but it's all very different depending on who's in the room and who walks in at any given point or how they react to one thing at any given point and all that and yeah he's become quite masterful at that so he's a great battle rapper he's a great dude yes he's the kind of this is yeah he's like the perfect contemporary pop star and now pop stars are also neutered and boring yeah I mean for God if you look at if you look at rap now compared to rap in the 90s the stuff that biggie was saying that he would do to you and your mother and all that sort of thing you just don't it doesn't happen anymore even rappers have just become very very self-conscious and scared to offend so there's certain things they're allowed to say in certain groups they're allowed to say things about that they stay away from the most part of stuff which is why instrumental one of the many reasons instrumental hip hop is now the biggest your honor on YouTube can you talk through the process of making say the the 12 rules for life piece which I've played a few times and keep getting more out of it this process of making 12 rules for life was completely different in the pro that my previous process which was tell I wanted to put across Peterson's ideas in the form of sort of arcing stories over a low fire music that would take you on an emotional journey that was doing a similar thing so I would find little bits of lots of different lectures and I'd often find him talking about the same thing but over the course of 20 years in different lectures tell that story from lots of little pieces so what was his response because you you said you've been in touch with him what did he what did he make of it yeah he really liked he loves it he says it's very surreal he asked me to come and perform with him at the all few minutes Angelus he wanted me to come down and sort of DJ and open the thing but unfortunately the Orpheum wouldn't accommodate that as such late notice but yeah he had that show and my whole thing with 12 rules was to get it done in time to be around the time he put the book out and so that when he played in Los Angeles it will be ready and yeah yeah he was very into it and I spoke with his wife Tammy and afterwards since she said they're both loved it and we're really kind of amazed at how he was actually good and sort of ridiculous and he despised the whole thing very very very very surreal and he said when he writes me said this is real ba he was thinking about using tracks from it to like open his lectures and he's going on tour later this year it must be incredibly bizarre for him I mean he's become sort of the most the biggest internet meme of this year yeah yeah exactly I must be a very strange for decades and decades he's been doing this very specifically very dedicated Lee getting up at the same time every day work until the same point of night since 1983 I believe it was was at 83 or 89 there anyway on the same subject with the same girls and technology's just grown up around him and suddenly there's a way of disseminating all this stuff and he'd been very candidly record all of his lectures and keeping all that and like we were saying so then he has this vast vast library this vast back catalogue so if you would just get an answering which really everyone is even over the past year or whatever you know you could you could spend years going through this stuff yeah and that's a very powerful and transformative process for anybody no matter what period of your life I have a lot of people write to me because I'm the music aspect of it is very helpful to some people it's like I had one guy write to me was like he had a friend who was a smack ass and he was trying to get him into Peterson he couldn't be asked to read and he couldn't be asked to watch a lecture and then he gave him one of my mixes and then he really got into it through that and now he's off smack and he's like taking acting classes and he's turned his deceptive ways into acting and and now he's got a bit part in a film and this all happened in like three months but I have a lot of people and I have like a lot of old bit like a guy 70 year old saying you know of this stuff I got into it through the musical aspects and drew my sign or whatever and this is changing my life and I'm 70 and now I'm really excited about the future and stuff a lot of people are terrified of the future and a lot of people people think that we're kind of doomed even Petersons very kind of has very dark outlook but also very hopeful one because the end result of this this mass the conspiracy types about 10 years ago would always all talk about a mass awakening right when we all worked out that the people behind the news had agendas that the people in control didn't really like us that much and talked about this mass awakening but there is a mass awakening but the real mass awakening is people just becoming educated on all the stuff that the smartest amongst has worked out over the past couple of hundred years but wasn't privy to that many people yeah the internet D democratized many many things and the first thing he did was with music and I was there and I saw it happen and I saw record labels collapsing and I saw my a an our guy gets sacked after my first record deal almost instantly because the bottom just fell out then suddenly anyone could make music in their own home and anyone could upload it and anyone could take it from wherever and then that started happening with TV and then it started happening with journalism that's happening with money because of Bitcoin is is happening with everything and it's happened with education now anyone can go on YouTube and like learn something that previously you had to go to university for years and years to learn and you can get right to the core of what you want to know and you can compare and contrast with some other fucking smart people and the smartest people you can have the best teachers in the world right there so there's your awakening you have yeah and more especially since the intellectual dart web idea I'm more reassured that the internet does have this double side because it's very giving your take on that thing well I work in journalism yes so it's it's terrifying to me that it's destroying journalism like it's destroying it takes time to do good journalism it takes time to research it takes takes effort and and I also think that the filter bubble we've created tools that reward the lowest aspects of ourselves and narcissism our need for validation our tribalism these are the tools that we've got from the internet with us far and they've been very deliberately developed to hack our dopamine systems to hack our neurology for money it's like a late-stage capitalism model for this this new very very powerful technology and so I've been very pessimistic about that for quite a while yes and it's not until probably quite recently when I've seen the emergence of the intellectual dark web which I talked about in The Glitch a little bit as a kind of group of of countercultural thinkers who are kind of exposing the the way that a lot of the media especially has been engaged in groupthink which is why Trump came as such a surprise with my bricks it came as such a surprise and so it I'm now seeing before I really saw the sort of dystopian nature of well we're destroying truth we're undermining truth were undermining all of our sources of truth now I'm starting to see that there is a sort of self generated best ideas winning aspect that's going on at the same time that you're seeing through like the Joe Rogan podcast for example and the Dave Rubin show of these guys finding each other the the Ben Shapiro's the Jordan Peterson's the Eric Weinstein's of this world are starting to be self selected by the Internet at the same time as you're having a lot of things being eroded away and that's giving me a little bit of hope I still think things are gonna get really rocky before because what we're seeing is the destruction of all of the structures all the structures everywhere are being undermined by the force of technologies anything there's a middleman is what it is so the universities with middlemen for knowledge and then and what they do what's happened - who said was it anyway as this happens everyone pivots to enter sort of being entertainment or gossip so news used to just you know give you news and then you can get news from all over the place any random guy on Twitter so news becomes a sort of entertainment thing and it's got a slant and it's got a gossipy angle and that's what it does education has done the same thing they all do that so you're not seeing the destruction of the whole thing you seen the destruction of the middleman or like you know but the actual knowledge itself isn't being destroyed and the access to the knowledge is actually increasing and while there's the initial you know which is there was the meme that was put about out by the media that was scared the fake news me right well you can't trust all these guys because they're not us but that backfired on them because then you can see a million examples of where they have themselves deliberately misinformed or you know been insincere or whatever for deliberate reasons so they kind of destroyed themselves it was like the final blow was dealt by themselves with that and then people aren't as stupid as they've been made out to be which also makes a little sense it's like the death spiral of the media because they're kind of audiences of declining is itself now part of the problem because they are being forced into more and more clickbait II kind of stories themselves because they've become this clickbait lunatic asylum but what that means is like we say in the algorithm thing it means suddenly you can watch a person having a really really in-depth conversation with another person and they're educated on a subject you can watch them doing it for hours whereas in the previous model you could only need to see five minutes you know the Kathy Newman thing this is your world if you're watching that on television you'd see five minutes edit sit down through a little thing and it might distract you from your chips or whatever and get you a bit annoyed but that it's on the internet you can sit there and watch that thing for an hour and then you can really think about it and then you can go watch both of those people talking about other things at length and this is a much more heightened state of awareness and consciousness and sort of being than anyone had previously you know I think about but it also then puts the onus on the on the individual as well yeah there's a kind of democratization of it yeah it doesn't mean that everyone suddenly will be super smart overnight and that like you know the world is saved in that fashion but it means that you have a generation growing up who you expect something a lot more something that was limited to a very small number of people and in the universities used to be for the aristocracy now anyone with a smartphone has access to pretty much all of the world's knowledge exactly it's never existed and this is at the Library of Alexandria in your pocket at all times yes everybody does I think you follow the same stoic gum I love that guy he follows me even if I was 82 people I'm really hoping it's not too talking because he would may be a great source of audio material but that last point is an important point because this was or what Orwell wrote about this many years ago there's a certain class who claim to be you know fighting for and arguing for the working classes but they actually hate the working classes they they look down their nose at them and they ended breakfast breaks it made this so apparent you know you've got this kind of sort of elite core liberal core in London who hate the rest of the country and think that they're all racists comebacks and have no empathy whatsoever for their actual lives and what all these policies have actually done to their day-to-day lives there they hate them and the only thing they hate more than them is the really rich and that was the case hundreds of years ago and it's still the case the frame that I look at things through is similar to Peterson is sort of Jungian lens and the idea of the shadow and the shadow is that of all the parts of yourself that you repress and deny and what it feels like to me is that this democratization of everything is allowing all of the shadow aspects of our culture to come to the surface and so the process we're going through and this is so clear with Trump it's like Trump you couldn't design America's IDI more more better than than Trump it's like it's everything that America wanted to deny about itself that the the narcissism the the worship of wealth for its own sake I mean all of these aspects of America that we know a part of the American character but Americans don't really want to admit they're part of a more liberal Americans don't admit a part of the American character so I say on so many levels we have these figures emerging as the aid or the shadow of these different and our our task is to integrate them and so it's just kind of say okay so what is what does Trump say about me yeah or what does yeah or all of these figures all of it's like what part of myself is is Trump representing for example but this is this is why it's sort of it's it's a sort of the deep do I think Peterson so interesting as well that we need a deep mythological structure to make sense of all this archetypes and the idea of yeah this sort of young who seems to have gone deeper into the human sold and just about anyone in the 20th century is like probably the key guide that we need now to kind of get through the next 10 years or so yeah exactly maybe maybe less just things that happening remarkably speedily like seriously you think like we went five years it's like a different world different world it's like if you look at like meme culture and how important meme culture has become like Trump was partly elected because of memes meme humor is black is as dark as as anything it is is pure darkness yesterday a British man was found guilty and is looking at a year in prison for a meme you know you know about this guy yeah what he did was he his joke to annoy his girlfriend was teaching his girlfriend's dog to respond to hit the quotes by doing is doing a Heil Sieg Heil or whatever whatever you call that thing we are we allowed to find that funny iPhone I have quite dark humor anyway and I you know I was I was a big brass iPhone and now the world is brass i right and that's is where we are but this guy's going to jail but the thing is all you look at any mean group on the internet this is like half of Facebook is what they call dankmemes which is basically Hitler jokes and that used to be work that was what John Cleese did that's like that what's its vs. anagram Lynam who's like very very vocals social justice guy on Twitter like father Ted was full of Nancy jokes and suddenly Nancy jokes because they're being made by Commodores with YouTube channels and like you know they're they're awful like all of meme culture is black and dark and full of sorrow the all of contemporary rap music sort of the underground stuff that then influences the mainstream is dark as hell and it's all suicide and I want to kill myself and just just goth Ness is vast right now and that's shadow side of is the biggest thing within culture everywhere within comedy within music it's saying it's kind of erupting out of everywhere in everything in every aspect anything I look at any of the worlds that I pay attention to and I saw this coming because 2010 was the high 20 2010 we were quite psychedelic the biggest musical force culturally was Odd Future who wore tie-dye shirts with unicorns and cats on them and they were they were multi you know they were like black kids and white kids and they didn't have any access to grind about anything to do with race or anything like that and it was all very jolly and nice and everyone was doing Molly which was ecstasy sorry and everyone was doing mushrooms and acid and after a psychedelic thing always swings back to a nihilist dark think it culturally it's usually about every seven years so it was definitely gonna go goth and lo it did and now all the drugs people are taking it kind of like speedy cokie type drugs and everyone's dressed in black and talking about suicide and all these things are erupting but this is coinciding with this technological shifts are it's the biggest we've ever seen this happen and it's happening across the whole West so it's like it's it's it's a catalyst or a magnifier this is the technology this is partly us looking through the kind of wrong end of the telescope and and one of the things the news media does is we look back it's like a fractal pattern and the fractal pattern is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger because we look back at say the late 60s and we think oh wow it was tie-dye it was acid it was everyone was doing it it's like no no the fact that we know about it means it wasn't everyone doing it the news media will will focus on what is unusual so maybe like 1/10 of 1% if that are doing this this culture whatever it is and we look back at kind of the acid period of the goth period or the Punk period and we assume these were eroding meaning everyone was doing it no these were aro defining but because they were unusual it was a small group of outliers every time but every time the pen you think of it like a pendulum I think of it like a fucking lump hammer on a rope right and it's swinging back and forward and every time it smashes the wall a bit bigger and every time there's more people like hanging on to the thing that it's and it does this like every 7 years you can look back at history and it does it but now it's fucking vast and now it's like a fucking nuke and every time it smashes on either side it like it's like a new truck so it's gonna we're gonna go full-blown psychedelic again in a couple eight three years or something we're gonna come out of the dark nihilistic lunacy thing we're going to be integrating our shadows in a fucking ridiculous Technicolor thing on mass because we're all now completely connected we're all completely sort of digitally fused in some fashion and everyone's kind of used to it by this point so that's when you have real radical societal change and that's when it's I would say likely to be incredibly positive hmm he positive or negative about the future yeah are very positive this is the best time to be alive in recorded human history for everybody more people drinking clean water more people with access to information children not dying immediately like women able to wander around outside without like rocks being thrown at them without being fully clothed like whatever it is any aspects you could think of is massively better now than it was even like 10 20 years ago you know is fucking it's an incredible time to be alive those really saying we all have these little machines with us that you can look at the negative aspects if there is fine but the potential positive aspects of them is fucking bonkers but it's also I mean I agree and I also believe that it's true that like Eric Weinstein sorry Bret Weinstein said about the the evolutionary tools that are brought us to where we are are likely to end in a catastrophe unless we evolve beyond them and I think George Michaud in the green wall I yeah I think us I hope so I hope so when you look at sort of politics or you look at kind of what's playing out on the on the the more structural level it's it's easy to make a case for that that we're not as long as I've been alive we've been like this close to Armageddon at all times if you're watching the six o'clock news so if that's all you're looking at then we've been doomed for our entire lives and that's just always the case there's always like some tin-pot dictator or whatever who's gonna drop a bomb or something you know whatever the fuck that's always gonna happen everyone in the 80s was terrified of nuclear winter and I read where the wind blows like everybody else did as a small child and was like fuck for whatever that's always been going on there's literally always been the case throughout and the entirety of human history there's always been some barbarians at the gates or some like Drake calamity or some great flood or whatever the fuck it is but what we have now that we didn't have before was all of this that we've just been talking about we have all of this being available to not just a tiny minority of the population but to the actual majority of our Western populations and now increasingly the rest of the world they fucking every major continent and the results of this I think can only be brilliant so I think yeah I'm very excited about the future and I think you know we're gonna see some wonderful wonderful things just in the next few just in the next few years what is it that you personally get out of Jordan Peterson what what what resonated for you when you first started listening to Jordan Peterson I think the same thing that resonates for most people which is meaning and purpose meaning and purpose and glory of discipline the that whole thing if we've been fed this just fucking just vast diet of Rights forever and the whole personal responsibility and it's always been a big thing of mine my whole first album was about the individual and the right of the individuals and the necessity in the individual to change the world and be allowed to be them which sampled the prisoner a lot and stuff and then the second one was kind of more inward and about like all of us all together and the importance of that and then you kind of come through that and it's back to the individual and like personal responsibility is the thing only what is that I used to say I used to wonder around things myself only you can save mankind because only you can only one person taking responsibility for their life and everything around them and then their family and stuff can actually change the world you can't change the world it's sharing a big shouty mob it's just it's just too messy and that is a one and it's just wonderful to see someone communicating the importance and the this sort of like transcendental majesty of personal responsibility to a mass of people all at once just at the point when we needed it most which is which again goes back to the nature of the internet I think that's that's what's amazing about Peterson is that he's genuinely sort of crowd-sourced in terms of his response that he's got from from people he and I what I'd love to ask him about this because I have a sense that he also is quite least quite spooked by that because the fact that he's rocketed to fame so quickly shows how needed that message is yeah let's say he cries every time he talks about it every time you talk it he talks about that aspect he just starts crying all of us immediately because this whole you know he has a son and a daughter I have a son this whole like the stuff that they're this is foul poison they're trying to put on half of the human population it could it have been completely ruinous and the Overton Window was so far in one direction and he's almost single-handedly moved the Overton Window like Alma like back over here and if we keep going along this course and now all these other people are being listened to like the Overton Window can we move back to a point where we're certainly not in danger of like actually completely destroying half the population in an irreversible fashion and then we're completely fucked and then we can get back to the thing where we all work together then we respect our differences it's male in female and we like work in glorious unity to further the human experiment and go into the stars would be like wonderful creatures out in the universe and I'll be cool and awesome and wonderful we would literally got to the point where it was like right you go like have the viewer evil scum and should be treated accordingly and should be ashamed for existing you fucks and like people are starting to think that there's people like thinking that that's true but I think we've been saved from that precipice and I think Peterson actually will go down in history as being instrumental in that well that is something even just from the the men's work that we've done so far it's interesting that there are a lot of guys from my generation and maybe lower younger than me who yeah you get that sense of kind of internalized shame around themselves as men yeah which is really kind of dark it's like a fuck yeah isn't very unhelpful or nothing comes from shame I mean nothing good and nothing good comes from like I've got say this is people who didn't do anything being made to feel bad for something that some other people did no no it was it's not like the Harrod sorry the Weinsteins are in a kind of inner interment in a majority it's fucking bizarre what got you into the hole man's work thing I've been doing various sort of personal growth work for quite a long time right I experimented with psychedelics quite a lot University and then when I went into my first sort of personal growth workshops what I found open up was a very similar space like the space of freedom and reprogramming myself and kind of really examining my beliefs and challenging myself and then of this sort of sense of flow and freedom would come in yeah we sort of started teaching men's work at that point I've been leading a men's group and then we started doing a we did a weekend a day long workshop and we started doing weekends and it was then at the time of the Trump collection I was like wow these gender dynamics are playing out on the the wider stage and when I started kind of learning more about you and the idea of the anamur in the Animus and it's like wow this is like this is almost like the secret key to everything that's going on and I really feel that men's work at the moment is almost counter cultural oh that was yeah that's my other point about the other thing I think is interesting is that like this stuff is is the new counterculture it really really is it is in no way like edgy or rebellious to be doing anything any of that social justice type stuff that is the mainstream it's now rebellious to clean up your flippin room it is countercultural to have your shit in order to choose a partner and stay with them to work through things and not just run off at the first sign of danger it's countercultural to to say anything about any kind of men's issue is there's radical its met which is a bizarre bloody thing this is half the population you'd think if they're if they are so bad you'd want them to be sorted and in a decent shape surely that's helpful like all this stuff that you're doing is like punk rock this is the the punk stuff now this is the counterculture now you can't win the culture war and then and then also be like counterculture so the left is in this you know odd position now of kind of thinking of themselves is cool you look at YouTube and stuff all the all the cool young people on YouTube there this world they're interested in this stuff and they're talking about this stuff the biggest young person on YouTube is PewDiePie and he loves Jordan Peterson dank memes and you know that is that is the counterculture now it is the counterculture and it's also I like what Jordan Greenhalgh said in the documentary I don't know if I used that particular clip but he said that the the left has replaced genuine openness with an ideology of openness yeah and that's really I thought that's a really powerful way of looking at it yeah so it's a dogmatic version of openness that is no longer open to many things I mean the idea of certain things are now not allowed in that world be for example intrinsic differences between men and women it was a summer saying yesterday some biologists saying that he used to be fundamentalist Christians who were the biggest like problems for him and attacked his work the most often and now it's the now it's the far left and this is really what's happened you know I think most of used to consider ourselves very left and I was a Billy Bragg fan and all this sort of stuff and the people who used to attack the things I liked used to be sort of fundamentalist Christian types and now they're the people who I thought were like me and now they're the people saying you can't say this and you have to say that and you can't enjoy this and women need to wear more clothes and all this crazy shit it's fucking mental what I got most from Peterson is that listening to him mapped onto everything that I followed already knew in a way like a lot of the in my journey I think has been very different from I even calling it a journey kind of suggest I'm currently slightly more personal development kind of perspective but definitely over the last 10 years well over the last 10 years as like as I've done a lot of personal growth work when I listen to Peterson I realized that what I was doing was incarnated the low-cost more in my own life that's what I was doing more and more by and that allows then I kind of realize that's what that's what it's about is kind of the learning to learning your truth and then speaking your truth much more clearly and then a lot of the shadow work that I've done sort of Jungian shadow work is then really integrating that sort of integrating those sort of divorce parts of yourself it's like within the men's work the idea is yeah you've got this kind of you've got a you've got an inner killer I mean we we have to I mean Jesus we we are maybe kind of a monster yeah make yourself a monster or at least extend you have that monstrous aspect to you and get it working for you rather was against you it has used in the world yeah because if you're suppressing your anger the world is going to trigger you in some way where that anger is going to come out and then you're then you're a danger to yourself and others because control of it and it's like this is this is really countercultural stuff as well it's like not the idea at the moment is that men must suppress this kind of aspect of themselves it's like red blood yeah terribly Oh like go whatever they do yeah it's like no one's read a Hulk comic book or whatever is like yeah and that's what I don't know you said recently but the the idea it's not that women and women aren't pissed off with people men who are in control of their monsters and their shadows men are pissed off with all these other dudes these like guys who swallowed the whole propaganda and are all thinking they need to act like women and need to suppress key lunacy is inherently toxic and they should and it's those sorts of men that women don't like and are annoying he's beets are orbiting sort of like creepy sort of well there's an article in Playboy a couple of days ago about male feminists yeah how a lot of the people who've been exposed through the me to yeah they won't turn out to be male feminists yeah yeah it's like it's most of them it's a ridiculous percentage it turns out it's not these like sort of man's man types who apparently awful it turns out to be like the creepy little piece of ones and it's because in a world of sort of like dominance hierarchies or what-have-you those who can't survive through traditional means of masculinity come up with sneaky ways of sort of like getting around the edge of it yes all right so if I can't be asked to like you know like work out or whatever or educate myself will become really good at a useful thing because useful to lots of people I could do like a sneaky thing and kind of like ghulam onto someone some ideology or something and then maybe I'll get my dick sucked it's very obvious when you see this you could see in their flipping off nice there's a terrible state of affairs and it's nobody like saying women don't like it so what's your what are you trying to sort of build here so you trying to take your sort of the workshops you're doing it means work on sort of global internet level or something I've been going off instinct so far I I I know that like I'm really deeply involved in ideas and love kind of yeah yeah whole intellectual dark web and like where are the conversations happening that are the ones that we need to have to help us evolve to that next level and I studied philosophy but I also know from from the personal growth work that I've done that unless you're living out an idea in your life it's not real and so that's why the personal growth workshops are about and I hope I hope that it gets to the point where we can kind of spread it much wider than is at the moment we've run like a few workshops so far and I think the world is ready for something that's offered in a in a none new agey none kind of sucky aesthetic and the Brit and I think Britain is ready for it as well because we've always been very suspicious of this kind of this kind of work in the UK right he said rightly saying I also like that about Jesus yeah yeah being similar we say that as well he's like I don't like he doesn't he doesn't like any of that type of stuff he's very practical man so you taking these sometimes nice e'terica ideas but grandi living in a very except you're a male kind of accessory practical fashion very practical you know and women have had things for quite a while than ways to get in touch with their sort of spiritual side and all that sort of stuff and like you yoga and all these things and mindfulness and stuff and there's a practical there's a brilliant practicalities of Peterson's approach which takes quite deep concepts and puts them in a way that can be useful and I think kind of taking that and the prep actually people doing it in real life and bringing people together so they know that it's not really because if when you're looking at things on YouTube you can be talking to a thousand people comments-section you could still feel alone so bringing this stuff into the world when I saw Pearson at the Orpheum in Los Angeles it was a day Ruben came in and introduced him and I'm really seeing all these people that have just seen on the internet they're all in a room and it's that like 15 thousands of people in that room everyone's like they thought I think that that doing more of that and then turning back into Internet stuff so turning that into shows and turning that into vlogs or what have you do it could be really really useful and kick things up to the next level because I think this intellectual dark web thing is just really really very much the first stage of a much much much much bigger thing is just just it's just the very beginning it's just scratching the surface of the potentiality of using this medium and kind of like forsaking that which has gone before which he just assumed was the way things had to be what I love about Peterson is he introduced this idea of okay how does it feel in your body when you're saying these words exactly like this idea of you you know if you really if you really sent into how your your body's feeling when you say certain things or when you yeah that there is a deeper alignment because otherwise it just becomes a sort of intellectual game again it's practical for an average person who hasn't spent like 30 years like reading young yeah like he's been getting shit for that like you know people some people say oh he's like a idiot like a thick person smart person or whatever you as if that was a bad thing like it's bad to take like big ideas and translate them in a way that a person who hasn't been to university for thirty years can understand that's what we need that's actually what society increased the priesthood complaining about him exactly this is Lady Sacrament yeah how dare you God is not for these them it's for us only we can speak with God and only we can commune with the divine and then let the problem this is this is this classism and this is why it's really interesting seeing it playing in the UK which is a very class based society it really is that any intellectual classes a minute have you seen anyone else on YouTube or online doing anything similar to what we've done in terms of like you've you've kind of created these epic mixers of Peterson staff I've kind of made a couple of documentaries about his own but they will they're already started yes I speak is it a coincidence that they're both from the UK yeah yeah yeah there's a point I wonder but it is it's about to be a lot bigger and it's about to be normal yeah but this is kind of a new thing and it was necessary you just do think it's necessary right see when you going off instincts and you're seeing all the synchronicity isn't start for anything I filled a hole because lots of people just wanted this thing I have so many people in like I had the idea but I didn't do it I really was hoping someone had done this people be literally like googling like lo-fi piece and see if it exists and glow it doesn't same thing you're doing so you know let's do lots lots more of it and lots of other people will start doing it but I think you've got a real potentiality for creating something quite vast and important but you just have to work you have to do a lot you have to feed the algorithms yeah YouTube requires content three times a week at least over ten minutes and we if you start doing that you'll see your numbers going up pretty fast and this is what I've been seeing like I'm putting on like 150 subscribers a day on YouTube at the moment just like every day and doing like sort of 20,000 views a day and the fucking graphs are all like resume like that but it's like as I've started implementing like quite a rigid sort of content schedule and stuff you see it really rocketing any more Peters and stuff coming up oh yeah yeah of course thing with Peterson I mean I was saying this to it to his wife it's like when you're making music and writing and stuff oftentimes you quote the Great's and you know you quote a hunter assumption or you quote young or whatever but they're all dead you know knew they didn't they were audio if there are audio recordings of them they're not very good and there aren't that many of them and here we have Peterson like spit fucking napalm on a daily basis like dropping laying in hours of audio every day it's all fucking brilliant and all incredibly quotable and it's also incredibly sonorous musical and beautiful and important necessary right now if I did nothing else in my life even if I didn't even eat I could just sit there making Petersons music forever because there's so much material so I will continue to make Peters and stuff and they all continue to be useful when there's also many many other things to draw into music and make useful in that fashion it's basically it appears to be a new genre or at least a new way of sort of communicating ideas and stuff and I've always done it I've always made mixtapes that brought in people talking and bringing in ideas and made it musical we're just like now there's a real big appetite for it and thanks to those lovely robots over at YouTube it's just this expanding universe of potential for people actually wanting to listen to it and being able to do it there will be a JB Petersen low finds on row well there is well I mean you're the only one so well no other people are doing it now if you go if you go look it up there's actually loads of people doing it now - like the varying degrees of sort of success but lots of people are doing it and I've been doing you know with other things and it's it's called meaning wave now someone called it that and of course there is a there is a there was a genre it's now yeah it's a thing it's called meaning wave it combines music aesthetics of low firing vapor wave and vapor trapping and cloud wrap and with meaningful spoken stuff so it's not just Peterson no it's now just it's kind of like the intellectual darkweb thing I guess but with music I've been doing lots of them but now other people are doing it so yeah what if I mean this just in the past couple of weeks I've did a thing with Jaco willing Morrissey Bukowski I did an audio movie version of Harrison Bergeron and then I was doing that and I've always loved that story and in my research I found that Peterson had read it in one of his fireside chats he just read the story but I used someone else's voice on that anyway that's been very popular so yeah I'm doing less of that stuff but lots of other people doing it too and I'm actually expecting at some point in the not-too near future one of these things will end up like transcending the internet and becoming an actual hit and then there'll be loads of it so yeah what a time to be alive yeah I Karen thank you very much thank you fully David and so was born [Music] humanity itself yes and then it's tens [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
