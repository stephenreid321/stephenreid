[Music] Jamie so we did an interview about a year ago now and it wasn't interview I was expecting because you stealing fire had come out - a couple of years ago now all about flow state transformational culture and what I was expecting was an interview about kind of the value of transformational culture and kind of how flow states are essential for evolution and all of the stuff that isn't stealing fire and what you actually did was poured a kind of big bucket of cold water all over that idea and just said hang on whoa whoa whoa whoa we need to be careful because we've got all of these tools but we're not using them properly and it looks like we're going to make some of the same mistakes that everyone's always made with these technologies how have you changed in the last sort of year since we spoke last time yeah I mean I would love to say that was just you know whistling past the graveyard moment but no I think I'm actually far more pessimistic and concerned actually in ways that I didn't even anticipate coming out of stealing fire they were there was some sort of obvious known issues that in the documenting of hey there's this revolution in non-ordinary states and not just flow States but you know meditation and smart tech and psychedelics and kind of just pretty much every way in you can imagine people are starting to crack that code and put those things together combine them and do all sorts of things and at the time I'd laid out three potential sort of known pitfall areas the first was commodification the idea that being able to hack our neural chemistry are sort of the biology of bliss that it could be used to sell us more shit and absolutely 100% you know hasn't is in increasing quantities and the move into vrn AR and algorithmic social media and all those kind of things is pretty well-documented most folks are actually more aware of that now and it's happening anyway the other words weaponization then saying hey state actors with massive budgets are super interested in super soldiers and super interested in everything from mind control to performance enhancement that this whole range and again you know has been going on for half-century plus and is simply we would just predict it would continue but the third one was sort of our own worst interest are the hedonism and that element what he that element has shown up far more virulent Lee than anything I sort of anticipated and it really does feel that the sort of psychedelic Renaissance or the stealing fire revolution whatever I want to call it is really just showing up as a Children's Crusade these days and there's an awful lot of people kind of rushing in and we are actually you know finding ourselves a being led by people who don't know what they're doing be in the you know the steepest part I've kind of you know that got in a research groups hype cycle idea that you know there's the there's the peak of expectations followed by the trough of disillusionment and then you know over time you kind of slowly and gradually get back to what's actually gonna be the steady state promise and delivery of any given movement technology etc and so I think we are literally almost at the high point and just teetering on the brink of the crash which I would probably timestamp as anytime in the next 18 to 36 months we would anticipate a collapse along a series of kind of fairly predictable vectors and what do you think that crash is gonna look like well I mean I think you can take it probably macroeconomic medical professional and then sort of social and so speaking that now if we can a narrow the focus from a sort of over a broad revolution in ecstatic techniques and technologies and that kind of thing he likes actually get down to specifically you know what Michael Pollan is written about is the psychedelic Renaissance what its kind of you know really bubbling to the surface these days the first is it's not going to look anything like what the early revolutionaries ambassadors and advocates hoped or wished and that's just kind of table stakes things never do you know if Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson looked at the 2016 election they'd be like what the everliving fuck just happened right and even mentor if I was John Mackey he was the founder of Whole Foods you take the example of those guys and a little bunch of little you know anarchist hippies in 1982 or 1983 in Austin Texas you know building a health food store and it was Birkenstocks and big bulk bins so you know bulgur and carob and that was their thinking and now it's you know now it's $20 a pound artisanal goat cheese and a plug-in for your Tesla's and your Lexus hybrids you know on the one hand you would say if you were an idealist from back at the inception of that thing you would say this is an utter corruption mutation this is not what we thought or what we wanted but on the other hand Whole Foods at least prior to Amazon acquisition right Whole Foods has been an absolute global market maker in organic foods and additional companies like Trader Joe's like Costco even Walmart is now that has the largest private label organic brands none of that would have happened were it not for that Whole Foods growth are concurred into the thing it you know one of the inception could have seen so just as a general premise whatever this turns out to be it is probably not gonna look anything like people at boom fest or people at Burning Man or even the kind of you know elders of the 1960s movements would have imagined hoped wanted or even recognized as their own offspring so let's just assess that and you know wouldn't know know know battle plan survives first contact with the enemy and nor does any disruptive technology but at the you know and actually along those lines one of the simplest things that we will see as we'll see captured by Big Pharma so you know most cyclic compounds you know beyond patents they're all expired they're all open source which has no interest in innovation and no interest in the ability to capture and set pricing so what we've already seen is things like ab a-- dialects their first synthetic cannabinoid that has now been approved for seizure use epileptic seizure used we've just seen the the approval by Johnson & Johnson Avice get amine so an intranasal I mean a variation and we connect we would expect and anticipate much much more of that that there will be the attempt to come back in with large R&D budgets large IP protection tweaking and modifying molecules in order to get it back into the stack of Big Pharma product launch development price setting etc and again as we said already seeing that happen and we should expect a lot more of that in conjunction with that we'll probably see again to the chagrin of the revolutionaries we will see a an isolation and a backing out of many of the subjective you know qualities that aficionados or enthusiasts see is central so if you look at the World Health Organization's descriptions of ketamine and nitrous adding the nitrous oxide even just take those two experiences they will be able to you know in one line they will say you know known side-effects you know excess ideation and you're like yeah that's actually why all all non-prescribed users are using this stuff by the time you get it into a the medical industrial complex right those are actually seen as as problems to manage not central reasons to to do and so what we will quite likely see in addition to the tweaking of molecules for patentable and controllable process and price setting you will also see an isolation of basically biomedical input so for instance ketamine on the one hand this tends to disclose at high doses profoundly strange and either you know terrifying or deeply valuable depending on your experience in your disposition interior realms and domains on the other hand it's a excitatory glutamate receptor site anti-depressive ish so what we will see as we'll see the look the isolation and the focusing on certain biomechanical mechanisms of action and often the the partitioning or the minimization of some of the interior subjective ones that are typically what everybody thinks of when they think of psychedelics so that will be happening and what you could broadly say is we will see you know we wanted you know we sort of we we thought we were getting Woodstock and we're going to get prozac nation in 2.0 for the time being it's a very high margin high ten of a product to be pushing so if you take for instance ketamine clinics which are now booming in the United States I think there's over three hundred the last time I checked it's probably more now and there's a lot of other companies coming in and looking to do scale rollouts a huge part of that is that the floor typically for ketamine therapy is five hundred bucks an hour and the ceiling is anywhere from a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars an hour depending on location and kind of service level so you have an awful lot of people just being like oh shit that's actually good chin you get you get lots of people in and out and you get very high dollar very high margin relatively easy things sit here let me a jab in an ivy off you go and you can make sure you're okay you can you can summon an uber or a lyft and and you know you're safe as houses so there are right now quite strong market incentives to pull more people into this space than may have the grounding experienced ethical orientation or sense of the nuance and the complexities of it at the same time you also have you know an in do in some part due to that driver it's a good way to make to do profitably decent things for patients you also have you also have sort of psychedelic novices in the helping professions coming into whether that's a general practitioner MD or even a trained psychiatrist so we were actually at a Maps I was speaking in a Maps benefit in a not too long ago and sat at a table with a really well-intentioned psychiatrist who had been coming up through conventional Western medicine had not surprisingly found that tools for anxiety suicide depression weren't always working were looking for additional tools and had literally come to it from a very kind of conventional stepwise professional inquiry and had attended a ketamine licensing there you know therapy protocol and part of that was one experience with ketamine themselves so they can you at least a little bit about what they do and that was you know twelve months prior so this this is a person who had no prior exposure to psychedelics so psychedelic novice one exposure for their own experiences of ketamine and then jumped into administering it and they had all kinds of surprises that you know that they had patients who didn't who were freaking out when they had their first kind of slipping of egoic self-reference screaming and shouting they didn't they basically just had no idea the waters they were wading into and yet they were the licensed and certified professionals so back to your kind of known side-effects or exercise even versus that is the whole point we have a lot of folks not knowing what they're getting into getting it into it for economic kind of business model reasonings and not necessarily an understanding of how to skillfully Midwife patients through that experience if you're really just thinking take this medicine it does an igloo to make excitatory response we're not quite exactly sure how it works but it seems to have at it and then all the other things all the interior content that's coming up we don't actually have a place for that we don't have a place where in our service model we don't have a place for it in our integration and off to care and we don't have a place for it in our own minds and experiences that's going to set up for a lot of problems and then not combined compounding on all that so you've got a gold rush into the space you've got under informed people administering with less than fully supportive integrative protocols because they literally don't know what they don't know and they're treating this as they would any other prescription pharmaceutical take it watch the side-effects go home call us in the morning kind of thing and you're then you're also seeing predictably this is is this Clayton Christensen Harvard Business School you know talked about market disruptions and how this happens people come in at the top with high maje and high dollar stuff and then there's kind of a rush to a bottom and there's disruptors that come in well what we're already seeing and I've just just had someone send this I just kind of read this a couple of weeks ago somebody sent this in my inbox we're seeing novel adaptations to the business models so there's a group who's now looking to do ketamine therapy which is typically like best practice protocols for that six sessions for three to five thousand dollars right and it's usually it's a batch you kind of you buy it you pay it up front it's not always covered by insurance right so it's high cash cash up front and then you get that experience well now there's a group that's looking to do $900 you come in you have your first ketamine session in an office with direct oversight blood pressure cuff you know monitoring and after that you got take home loss news so you're like okay so now there's gonna be a rush to the box that we got a gold rush and we got a bunch of people piling it and I won't have massive public availability and a lot more people both clinicians and patients coming into this experience at the same time that all the margins are getting massively undercut and there's gonna be a race to the bottom so quality of care the sophistication and complexity of what can be done because how many dollars do we have to devote to this you know against existing medical models of just pop a pill go home you know we're not even gonna do talk therapy anymore because that doesn't work out that doesn't pencil out on the health insurance you know codes we're likely to see an erosion of care and an erosion of support and it will become more and more transactional at the very moment that it actually should become more and more integrative and holistic the final one is just the social so what's happening outside and Big Pharma what's happening outside of the medical clinical professions and and what are we seeing just in the level of enthusiasts who are now sort of hashtag because science you know they're seeing these studies that they're taking this research as validation of their own extracurricular efforts and explorations as well as the entire gray market economy that fully lives are in in that space and so we're seeing I mean back to that idea of the Children's Crusade we're seeing basically narcissism hedonism and commercialism showing up in the social sphere as well and and so the narcissism is is one I didn't I didn't I just didn't anticipate the virulence with which this is happening but you know that that sort of idea of you know they've done a fair number of studies these days with like the rise of super flus because of the excess prescription of antibiotics alright so doctors are just like Oh in and out you know you see you've got the sniffles you see you've got a cold I don't even care because I know that a you'll leave my office quickly if I give you a prescription B you'll rate me more highly on my online thing so I'm just gonna give you antibiotics and everybody knows that if you start taking antibiotics even if you feel symptom free you should keep taking them to the end right because otherwise that tiny little leftover of bacteria or whatever it can come roaring back worse than ever and so because of that over the last several decades we've created super viruses super flus and and it's the over prescription of antibiotics and you could make a fairly clear case that we're in that neck of the woods with psychedelics - which is that people are taking them and they're getting almost rid of their egos and not quite and they're staying their symptom-free they're like I'm a golden God whatever right I'm going to open my own workshop I'm gonna do this thing and that that egos are coming roaring back more virulent than ever so we're getting super egos and not only is that literally just you know a case of people not having any lineage background not a sense of discipline on a sense of the length complexity nuance difficulty actually fully growing up as people just developmentally informed kind of psychology juxtaposed against lineage practice but it's also being amplified by social media loops so now are having people you know no sooner are they having an experience of ego dissolution or so you know whatever might else occur in these spaces then they are composing their social media posts and snapping selfies here's me down in the jungle watch you ma you know Oh amazing or here's me at Burning or here's me just coming out of my ayahuasca retreat in Williamsburg and whether it's the prevalence of folks like Joe Rogan and things like that where you have public pod public figures effectively openly talking about these things plus the ability for me to then share and virtue signal of my great latest breakthrough or my latest insight or just us living the life that is absolutely re skinning our egos faster than we're able to get rid of them and you can see that I mean the simplest example you know you're familiar probably with like the Museum of ice cream and those kind of interactive you know museums and installations around the world that are popping on these days and they're they're fun they're whimsical they're cute but what they really are Instagram backdrops you know so people are going less to be immersed in the actual moment and the actual delight than they are to be capturing it in a very contrived fashion for an audience that's not co-located with them it's it's for digital digital selves and I noticed that I didn't know what I was looking at actually when I first saw it but three four years ago there was an inflection point at Burning Man and you know if folks are familiar with that it's a it's an outdoor festival in the desert and the desert is you know it's one of the Salt Flats so it's completely a flat white expanse and there's you know one of the most compelling things about that place is this these larger-than-life art exhibits and so this white flat does it becomes effectively like an amazing gallery and their giant there they're just oversized you know 50 feet tall 60 feet tall giant things and they're almost all interactive there's something about the art it's not to be passive and go boom yes I learned his use of color and composition and form you know you engage with you hang on it you swing on it there's a joke there's an interaction there's something that shifts your state they're all psychedelic odd in that respect or ecstatic out in that sense and what's what's been happening in the last few years you really know shit this is just the Museum of ice cream in the desert people are just literally coming up to up not not interacting with it as humans not not allowing themselves to be moved or transformed by it but literally just using those backdrops for their own social media profile so digital Gnosticism has overlaid with the psychedelic Renaissance in ways that is and it's it's a little bit like that cut Vonnegut but cat's cradle you know where I sign is that weird molecule that can freeze all of all water molecules on the earth and basically end life right and it almost feels like it's digitally fuel psychedelic Gnosticism is like ice 9 it is just encasing our world in super egos faster than we can actually melt them and that's fucking horrifying you know there's like these are arguably the most powerful tools that humans have ever assembled to get out of ourselves and yet these other tools we've built all right which leaves us in the echo chambers of ourselves have actually co-opted that enterprise and so that's yeah that's that's a horrific thing the next is just kind of hedonism which is again permission with with the psychedelic Renaissance with all the profound work that's happening with maps and Imperial College and a lot of the other folks that are just heads down doing an amazingly ethical principled work in service of the people who are hung out to dry I mean the people who are just suffering from debilitating trauma and anxiety and depression and suicidal ideation they're just really you know out of out of options there's that profound and beautiful work and you know and we wrote about it in stealing fire the idea that one two three sessions of mdma-assisted therapy for instance can just profoundly take a load off somebody who's been carrying those buttons themselves without help without relief it's beautifully uplifting but the reality is is that 33 or 303 sessions you know off-label done on my own time done recreationally or even with an attention there's an asymptote of return on investment those folks are 10 times has changed or transformers that people have done it once or three times and so my sense is is that there's increased permission you know that because science I'm micro dosing because science were tripping on the weekends because science and I and there's a sort of absolution of well are we making the most of it are we integrating this is this actually leaving me a better person or are these just different bright lights to go chase is this just a novelty is this just chemically-induced well-being that is fleeting and we're not actually doing the work around it and the final one is just commercialism or commodification which kind of is the first to the the narcissism plus the hedonism plus commercialism which is the idea that in this age of you know anyone can be an expert and all you need to do is publish an e-book and set up a blog and you know put out and put out a shingle and have an evite and see you see what Guppies come there is this the disconnect between depth of experience apprenticeship humility to the vastness of the psychedelic realm let's say and people's absolute brazen willingness to dip their toe in it to claim the mantle and to turn around and show their expertise to other newbies and newcomers so I've you know I'm an apprentice in training or I'm a shaman in training what you've been to prove twice or maybe three times and you've chucked a bunch at home and you're now actually presuming to lead people through experiences that you've barely begun to fathom yourself and if you think about like in which we're seeing this trend in in both places you know like what's happening the psychedelic realm is also happening in extreme sports where you're having more and more people toe into jaws this giant wave in Maui you know because they've seen it on Red Bull and they have no business they haven't come up through the ranks of Waterman you know they want the selfie water what's called GoPro courage you know and we're seeing you know the same with mountaineering there are people on 8,000 meter peaks now who literally are summiting you know with a guy dragging them up short ropes just literally can go like a dog on a leash I mean connected two carabiners in the harness in a literally getting dragged at the mountain and it's time to rappel off the summit and they've never rappelled before you know so you're like what on earth is going on you know people are big largely because of social media they are ending up in places they have no business being but now we're even getting to the place where people are presuming to lead others from that spot and it's the sense of can I gain money fame privilege prestige there's that there was a particular infra marketer I saw there just made me cringe they was talking about you know we will take you down to to Peru we're gonna host a medicine journey a retreat where you will download wealth codes right and we're the ones to help you and we have coached dozens of people to million dollar business and all this is shot selfie infomercial style as I walk around my rented mansion in Bali telling you that we've unlocked the universal source codes of abundance and we too can help you for as little as a ten thousand dollar retreat so you know the last gasps of cultural appropriation as well as you know in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed shall rule and we're seeing a ton of that as well so that's kind of those are just the factors I'm watching you know and and and I would imagine that I mean a they're all already happening so none of this is sort of you know Cassandra you know magining worse scenarios are saying well what if that happens these are all already happening the question is just where do they lead us lots to pick up on the one thing from from earlier you mentioned that the there's a sort of bifurcation where medicine is looking for the the medical effect while not being interested in the the psychedelic effect a lot of people in the psychedelic medicine space would say that the those two things are together like the the especially was for example psychedelic mushrooms that feeling of oneness that internal subjective effect is the therapeutic effect so with most of them that's not going to be possible is it to disassociate to to bifurcate those two things yeah and I think it's I think it's great that a number of the therapists that are working in this space are actually and somewhat strangely within Western clinical medicine courageously saying it's some of these interior experiences that are actually valuable and we need to notice them and build our protocols around them and the question will simply be to what extent does that persist here's again with large pharmaceutical companies tweaking molecules they're good that that's actually a messy aberration the interior subjective experience is not clinically controllable and manageable so wherever possible and this is you know as we've seen with epidemics right here's a cannabinoid rather than just like here's cannabis that grows out of the ground or grows in a greenhouse and it works they're like oh get away that pesky hi let's isolate it isolate isolate it to do the one thing for the disease case that we're trying to solve for chop it all up repackage it rebrand it and mock it up so that will be a question as to how long that persists does that now grow because that's actually the truth of the matter which is that majority of the healing is actually changing my relationship to myself and to my narratives and what's happening on a neurochemical and even neuroplastic level are the structural correlates to that change or are we gonna try and wring out those those known side-effects to create a more manageable process in the sort of industrial medicine thing so that's you know tbv but obviously you know full hats off to the folks that are taking a stand for that and I know that some of the people so I've done quite a few pieces about psychedelic medicine over quite a few years and I know that there's always been a sense of this tension between the scientific model and the experience itself and I know that some people even within psychedelic medicine are having their torn because they're thinking well we have an idea and some of the results that have come out from the latest one in the UK was Robin Carhartt Harris a lot of the the people who went through it had a they were relieved of their symptoms of depression for sort of three months at a time but then it would it would often come back and this sense everyone who's taken psychedelics kind of knows that yeah we get this after go period you have to put in some changes to your lifestyle or changes to your your your lived experience in those three months if they're going to be sustainable so people are being forced into a medical model that maybe is not helpful to them creating meaningful change in their lives and meaningful change for their conditions yeah I mean if you take the most kind of extreme boundary case I can think of which is something like psychedelic like five Meo DMT which is you know arguably and I don't think many people actually argue this is you know the most potent compound that humans have ever had access to and you come across folks who have anecdotally had you know one experience three experiences five experiences and I've been kind of watching over the last five years like and.and you know people come back you know hair on fire for you know this amazing exposure to what some people just say is literally unmitigated you know submersion in you know filling your superlative you know consciousness like god had the you know the universe ultimate true coming true like burning bush Ark of the Covenant you know level stuff and I haven't seen a single one of their personality structures structures shift and in fact particularly kind of west coast New York you know that convert that the kind of chattering classes who are most able to access this stuff it almost feels like it's just one more bobble to hang on the Christmas tree and like like going to a hip you know how did you get front-row tickets to Hamilton and that is pretty sobering I think and should put the rest of it in context which is is if you know if you go to developmental psychology you can see Bob Keegan at Harvard University folks you know people have been studying this stuff for decades and really taking a look like human change and adult development is hard and slow and iffy and there's no specific or singular intervention that absolves us of that incremental work and if you have a peak breakthrough experience I mean a you know what going up we're going to the waterfall with thimbles so in some respects the the access of information that typically comes through in a psychedelic state there's only there's only a fraction of that that we actually can sort of bring back into our waking state consciousness and into our lives and in fact sometimes it's contraindicated that there is no point getting lobbed to a hundred thousand feet if you can only breathe down to the first twenty to 26,000 feet so there's a lot of overshooting the mark of what can I translate into my life and then there's often a lack of as you said you know the hard dedicated work of integration that particularly when it's so much more tempting to go back to the Wishing Well right versus doing the shitty hard stuff and that people are often neglecting that even more when they have these quick little bypasses if I can only get to that place after two decades of meditation practice for instance it's slow it's distractive no one's got time for that these days there's a whole lot of reasons why traditional monastic practices or martial practices may or may not fit perfectly with pell-mell 21st century society but they had some checks and balances in them and you had to have prepared the vessel before you pour it in the sort of water of life now we're just swimming splashing around and spilling tons because anybody can get there with very little effort and as a result and we're not balancing it with the with the work afterwards what do you think about the the mix between the scientific model and psychedelic research it seems like an awkward fit however you spin it sure I mean you know you end up with sort of pee hacking and placebo effects you know so basically the idea that double-blind placebo-controlled studies I mean eight don't work that well in psychedelics because you really know in a heartbeat whether you've got the fake one or the real one and so even when they've done you know like take niacin instead of psilocybin so you get kind of a flushing and a tingling but no psychoactive effects it's pretty hard to cram psychedelic research into that specific pharmaceutical trials model the other element is the interior subjective experiences which are arguably a large chunk of the value and impact of these things don't subject themselves to controlled measurement you can do subjective analysis and surveys and things but again what are you tracking are you tracking like a mystical state inventory okay what wild-ass crazy shit did I see while I was there okay useful but not definitive are we discussing behavioral change shift in adult developmental complexity if so that stuff doesn't often change that fast or if it does momentarily have kind of a an off to glow effect it's going to return fairly close to baseline and you're really Nikken you can pick things up like long-term stage development maybe in a six month window but usually it's 12 18 36 months or longer to really see the arc if someone growing up as an adult and so our tools and our timelines just clinical trial and how long were you in them don't don't particularly submit to that and if it's a multi variable equation that creates the transformation which is I mean even just take it out of the labs what what happens where somebody might have an epiphany you might be in the rainforest with an indigenous shaman traveling out of your country out of your language out of your comfort zone different bioregions all those things combining to have the ayahuasca experience you had or if you're at a transformational festival and there's light in this sound and there's music and there's companionship and those are these things and a psychedelic compound and it was the entire thing that of that evening or that day or that week or whatever was that cracks you have been how do we back all those things out and so my sense is is that we probably need different research protocols if we're really going to try and sort of F the ineffable if we're going to really try and pin down what is the juju or what is the transformational magic and how can we both understand it better and help more of it happen more healthily for more people it would almost be the sort of the kitchen sink method which is figure out all the factors that for sure crack people wide open study that and then you just can back off back off individual elements until you get an undesired drop-off in efficacy and that's a that's a different way of doing it but I think we can't we can't think that atomizing elements and measuring them in isolation ever adds up to the mystery we might need to start with the things that we know for sure deliver glimpses of the numinous and then we know those are there and then we can start figuring out you know reverse engineering or sort of almost regression analysis what were the elements that were overwhelmingly contributed versus just kind of nice window dressing and do you think that psychedelics can ever be offered within a Western medical paradigm well I mean I think I think the medical paradigm was essential for socio-political legal reasons and that's why there's been enough that's why there was an initial emphasis on treatment resistant depression anxiety those kind of things because that's actually how it works it works within the legal codes it works within the system to say okay if these people are absolutely out of options then we might allow something more radical or innovative etc the thing that we're missing is is why would we why would we use it what is the ethic of use what is the orientation and it feels to me like at a minimum there's at least like three super functional uses for Peak States in general I mean psychedelics are a use case but they're not the only one but it's the idea of like first of all as metronym you know I am out of step with life the pulse the rhythm but I can't quite I don't know for sure right I'm busy I'm hectic I'm distracted I'm all these things and I drop in to a psychedelic State or any other you know skillfully produced the ecstatic space and I'm like oh this is where the one is this is where the metronome is telling me the beat is and I can cook I can correct I might have been half half a beat late I might be in half a beat early whatever it is I can correct and now I'm on the one and the next one is cheating for you know again running and going through life we bump into things we get hit we get hurt our instrument our bodies our brains our hots our minds gets knocked out of whack and we're just suddenly we think this is a sieve and it's actually C sharp or a little bit flattened really oh okay I'm trying to play with others but I'm actually sharp or flat let me tune my instrument and so the metronome and the tuning fork do a beautiful job of that and if you think you know to continue the musical metaphor musicians all use metronomes and tuning forks but they don't spend their entire day fiddling with knobs and strings and flipping the pendulum back and forth the moment they've got the one and the moment they've got a clean sea they go off to make music they either practice it themselves or they go jam with others and I think that's the relationship we really need with psychedelics not that we just constantly you just hit the bell hit the bell fiddling on spit all the knobs and the ideas like get yourself in tune get yourself on time go jam that's the point the point is to go make the music of life together and you know the final one it's a little bit just sort of training wheels and I think this is one where the once in a blue moon psychedelic experience you know once in a lifetime once a year whatever it would be needs to be supplemented because what we're missing I think this sort of the the weekly Sabbath can we dust that bastard off and reinvigorated because getting to once a month that once a season you know solstices equinoxes whatever the hell you know take your pick on calendar preference but what do I do recurringly and periodically because one of the things that the recent you know that the research that maps been doing with MDMA therapy right is that it does something very specific it shift your neuro chemical profile and actually Rick Doblin was just sharing with me the last time he and I talked that the closest neuro physiological analog they've found to somebody in an MDMA therapeutic dosage session is post orgasm and it's a state of CC 18 right you have you have oxytocin you have prolactin right you've got an increase in serotonin basically feelings of safety so purity belonging well-being and that that actually allows people to relax their vigilance response turn off their amygdala and their their threat scanning and be and have a little bit of distance between themselves and their stories and their past pains and that that alone can be transformational so what is it like for us to have to supplement the once in a blue moon there's no deep psychedelic dives with the idea of what are we doing one day out of seven what are we doing one day out of 30 or 90 and can we use those experiences to defrag our nervous systems and really open our hearts and expand our minds and say okay now I've got a sense of this I have a somatic marker for how this feels can I use this experience as training wheels can I actually go into the next day the next few days even how long can I keep this up how long can I practice living from a more courageous more vulnerable more open state until that becomes muscle memory until that becomes as familiar right as my old contract in reactive State and I think that that's that combination it sort of shoot the moon once in a blue moon I integrate the hell out of it and every and much more regularly in smaller doses can I do the metronome tuning for training wheel game and live into the better angels of our nature live into what's what what my highest most generous expensive self might be and if you've been documenting this culture for quite a long time what would you say that you're you're at now are you sounding the alarm do you think that anything can be done to mitigate the kind of the dangers that you've spelled out yeah I mean I mean I've it's brother this sort of sound the alarm because no one's gonna fucking listen right that's the other trouble with the psychedelic movement is its panting no muna apparently which means you know not subject to deference to Authority of any shape or form it's why you know in the 50s and 60s the US Army studied dosing soldiers to see if they could use it as a disorient on the battlefield and you know one of the unintended side effects was a budget you should have a bunch of enlisted dudes were like what the fuck am i doing in this uniform and I'm gonna put this gun down and I'm gonna go home now so there I think that Jeremiah ants you know from positions of authority highly unlikely to work but what I would say is actually more rather than a warning about more of a clarion call which is hey good news folks is we have access to a higher concentration of ecstatic and transformative technologies social technologies than any humans ever have on the planet . and we may not have the luxury to linger in the transition and you can assign this you can say hey these are both changes and higher-order things all conspiring to provide us these tools at this time you know send some folks do sometimes we'll make a case that like ayahuasca hasn't in an agency and them intelligence right and it's coming into this world not unlike the Dalai Lama saying hey the Chinese had to come and do horrendous things in our country to blow us out of Tibet of that isolation to bring the Dhamma to the West you know kind of just so stories of the psychedelic Renaissance I don't think you have to go there you could just simply say hey man shit's happening and it's here but it's here just in a time and we might not get the chance to gawk and dawdle in the magic and wonder of our own transformations it may be like here's the tools folks wake yourself up rip the fucking band-aid off and and you know get your wobbly legs about you and then you're needed like we are needed this is not to become this self obsessive recursive endless personal journey game maybe the hippies got to try that we don't we're all needed and we're needed at full strength and not just in ourselves but within for each other and so that would be my if I had anything to share it would be that like we've got the tools now we have to use the and there's not a moment to spare great claiming thank you [Music] you
