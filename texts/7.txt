[Music] - Eric thank you for making the time where we're going to talk about a couple of quality articles that have come out quite recently and talking about the IDW and the first one was talking about whether the IDW is intellectually diverse and then a follow-up article as well we're going to talk about some of the criticisms of the article but I'd like to starts I know that you're a fan of this tactic by Steele Manning that particular arguments if you were to restate the argument in a in a in a way that you think is more accurate than was made how would you do that well I think it's a great question David I think that part of the problem is that there are a lot of different skeins running through this discussion it's hard to pull them apart one of which is that some people within the IDW are fans of term classical liberalism and I'm not necessarily for it or against it it's just not a term that I tend to apply to myself and I don't think that sufficient care has been taken to say that some members of the group or movement or what-have-you use that label while others do not and so there's a bit of a pressure at the moment to say well you guys all call yourself classical liberals and I just don't think that that's the case so that would be the the first sort of steel Manning is is that I would want the critique to be more careful about saying that it's limited to those who identify as classical liberals and then the author has every right to try to make the case that the classical liberal position is in fact a version turbit ISM but I certainly don't think of myself as a classical liberal first and foremost I think of myself somebody who has progressive conservative and libertarian feelings on a variety of different issues I think that's why all of these positions continue to be explored with none no particular political viewpoint ever becoming dominant because if we're if we're really truly honest with ourselves when we say we're conservative or liberal or or progressive or what-have-you we're usually talking about kind of the leading note or tone that we are expressing and I think that you know when people are in cautious and they say well I am a staunch libertarian or I am a committed conservative then what they're doing is that they're exchanging sort of a degree of resolution for a four degree degree of clarity and a lot of people appreciate that clarity on the front end I pay a fairly heavy price by saying I'm not a free speech absolutist I'm very much associated with free speech but there are a lot ways in which I can't stomach certain kinds of free speech outcomes for example child pornography is not something that I would stand behind under free speech or from it you know many of us pay a hefty price for appearing to purists to be mealy-mouthed if you will when I said I'm not necessarily anti tribal I'm not necessarily you know anti progressive or Pro progressive or anything like that so I suppose what I'm thinking is that there's a critique made of wing if you will of the IDW as if it was the totality of the IDW and that wing is being faulted in the minds of the authors and others for an insufficient layer of a level of resolution and I think that those of us who paid a hefty price for saying well I'm I can't be tied to an absolutist position on any of this stuff really it so because we want to keep a very high level of resolution and so I think that there's a series of trade-offs there's no way of pleasing everybody I think when it what the article was trying to do and trying to say there's there's a further refinement and that has to do with the fact that if you brick progressivism or the left or whatever you want to call it into the traditional liberal core of the left and then you augment that with a fairly recent extremely aggressive upgrade which appears willing to attack reason civility as agents of oppression you know our tools of oppression I think that the upgrade really what is it at issue in a question what is it what is being questioned and if you believe that upgrade that extremely postmodern adjustment to classically progressive positions if you think that is now the new dominant left and it's not going away you probably take a fairly dismissive attitude towards the entire left-of-center Canon of thought and I would say that there are members of the of the IDW who believe that this current aggressive strain has displaced classically liberal or classically progressive positions which will never return and that we now need to deal with the fact that that upgrade is permanent and those people have probably decided that they are going to abandon any hope in a left-of-center position well I held that position that that upgrade if you will that marginal difference in a level of aggression and willingness to attack reason and data and evidence and itself in favor of tying people in knots logically and epistemologically I thought that was permanent I would understand quickly why do people who are completely abandoning any kind of resolution view of the left now it happens that I understand why they're saying that but I disagree I believe that many people are fairly moderate and liberal in their views and are going through a period akin to the McCarthy era which I've called left car theism in which it's very dangerous to simply say the obvious which is when you're attacking reason or one of two genders or concepts as abstract as patriarchy or anything like that you've probably made a fairly significant wrong turn somewhere in your thinking and while it might be difficult too dangerous for most people to explore their own relatively moderate left-of-center positions I don't think that'd be reasonable left or the analytic left or the traditional apps have gone away I just think that it's been terrorized into a sort of hibernating state and I think that's a that's a major difference between the sort of right leaning portion of the idea with you and the more left-leaning portion of the activity and I think you know that I may disagree with the people who are than the more right leading portion but that's what makes that's what makes it interesting certainly why I'm listening to them and saying who you really think this is permanent you think this is never going back now with what's very new if I understand it correctly is that Claire is suggesting that we are caricature the left he's Claire layman the co-editor correct that Claire and her author Yuri who she's publishing for making them hear frequently that the new upgrade to the sort of left orthodoxy it's not that it's new in terms of nobody's ever heard it before but it's never been as dominant to my way of thinking as it is now that that upgrade probably has more to it than we we would imagine and I think we're very interested to hear why Claire believes that we definitely believe that people are discount taking too much of what is going on on the left left a tremendous number of huge successes with gay marriage cannabis legalization and you know greater awareness let's say of gender fluidity issues I think that these are all things that you know we're long and coming and in our super report and I think that there are sort of representing the the best qualities of the left the question of whether the new highly aggressive strain has something new to say that's really that's fascinating I I was kind of unaware that Claire believed that so if the idea is that viewing everything through a racial lens and you know disputing whether or not lived experience Trump's any kind of objective of experience if that is in fact some sort of an innovation I'm pretty aware of it and I've heard this a lot I've heard that these ideas are now carrying the day on the left side of the aisle because they represent some understanding about the limits of rationality and that's one hell of a meeting I seem to have missed and just to sort of also steal manner a little bit from from my side it talks about that the dividing line now and I think there's there's some truth in this at the could it came from an original tweet that seemed to show that the most of the members of the IDW were liberal on most issues and he or he said that it feels wrong and his his idea was that the dividing line now I think this is certainly true online and probably started with with gamergate and has kind of developed through then is that the dividing line now is whether you are pro or anti what you might call social justice activism is kind of characterized as social justice warrior thinking that that is now become a big dividing line hasn't it well I mean I think this is this is very mysterious I think a lot of us have traditionally had a very positive view of social justice it's the warrior part this kind of vigilantism that we're having none of I mean I think all of us are having them and the you know that just sort of the sort of Glee with which people are talking about cancelling human beings and ruining lives and really excited about the idea that no platform will be given to or relatively moderate positions as if garden-variety Country Club Republicans or even real Democrats are one step away from Joseph Goebbels I mean that's the that's the really weird stuff that I don't think anybody has any patience with at all because it's not part of adulthood because some people would say that that is is a caricature and most people on the Left don't believe those those things there are far more reasonable people to have conversations with the won't that wouldn't kind of degenerate into reason is a tool of the capsules patriarchy law that that's a caricature is a very small part of the left well then here's the question why is it that this moderate reasonable EFT doesn't tell these shrill voices to shut up terrify the children our Wilding right the adults cowering behind their front doors because nobody wants to be doxed nobody wants to find that they're unemployable nobody wants to be shamed nobody wants to be canceled nobody wants to be called out I mean look this is an interesting point it has to do that that what is now fueling journalism is outrage and there's nothing more outrageous than publishing a story like he had be friends with white people anymore or I divorced my husband because he was white or do men deserve to be government at all or some you know if you publish something like that you get a lot of clicks because it's it's bananas it's just we're going through a business model shift and the baby boomers are in decline their narratives don't work we've got serious economic problems we're trying to roll up our sleeves and come to common purpose we've spent way too much time denigrating anything that smacks of patriotism as if all patriotism was jingoism we're deranged as the developed world has become deranged the idea that are supposed elites who are anything but believe me I've met them can't figure out why brexit past they can't figure out why Hillary Clinton lost really you can't figure out why if you've caught every single person who's a restriction ascend fo which they absolutely aren't most people who are restriction mister zina philic it's just based on epithet fear her shame this portrayal and it's endless boring and Yuri said in his article that the big dividing line was on the attitude to structural oppression and for example do you you you identifies on the Left do you do you believe in structural oppression do I believe that Robert Moses configured New York as a planner in order to you know keep certain parts of the city from having falling land values or to keep the races separate but believe that structural oppression exists that any smart person does I don't even understand well that was URIs point in his article work that the major dividing line at the moment is whether you believe or take into account structural oppression no no you're confused URIs out of his depth in my opinion structural oppression exists everybody knows that it exists I don't think anybody is seriously disputing whether structural oppression exists we're debating what the degree of structural oppression is so you know as I've frequently pointed out you have I think of the top hundred chess players ninety nine of them are male one of them is female do you believe that 100% of that imbalance based on shares of the population versus shares of the top hundred chess players is all structural oppression in a game that doesn't seem to know which gender is playing God I'm open to the idea that there's some structural oppression sure but do I think that it's 99 to one like you know it is his chest the most bigoted the most ferociously backward game in the universe which is systematically destroying the lives of female hopeful chess players I don't even know what cath way I could imagine that that was taking place so I think what we're debating is people who are gleefully claiming that all imbalances our structural question if they do not favor particular groups and he referred to an S recline article in the first piece where as reclined talked about the reactionary right online and it's a it's an interesting thing to put apart because in some ways and as you've said that the IDW is in reaction to certain things which we can argue about whether it should be in reaction to or not but how does it avoid becoming a purely reactionary movement and not saying okay there are certain ideas we need to resist but there's also a place on the other side of this where we can resolve some of these divisions look this is just a very stark cultural difference do you believe that the claims of structural oppression have skyrocketed in fact because oppression never been lower than it is currently and people who need a high level of oppression in order to continue to claim special privileges are amping up their claims that the only reason that imbalance continue to exist could be strong personal oppression if that's your perspective and I think we've seen this with the Southern Poverty Law Center that group that many of us have very positive memories of you know they've got a brick-and-mortar presence they've got a large endowment and there are very few Klansmen to hunt so it's probably a matter of political economy that you would expect that they would be looking for enough structural oppression to justify their ongoing commitments and operation now that's one perspective another perspective is gosh we got rid of all of the ostensibly causes of oppression and look at how imbalance things continue to be ergo it must be cryptic structural oppression and we have to you know triple our efforts to hunt it out wherever it is I think that would be closer to the experience of those who disagree with the idea and I think that that's a debate that I would be interested in having with people on the other side who subscribe to the same rules of debate I do I think one of the places where this has got an entirely bizarre is that many of us are encountering the claim reason itself and civility itself our tools of oppression and then as soon as we make the observation that we've encountered such claims some says oh come on nobody really believes that I I cannot figure out what is going on in the extreme left in terms of faith argumentation it's almost like a giant prank that never ends in both of the obstacles that seems to be quite a focus on Dave Rubin in particular why do you think that is and what do you make of it that's a good question I mean I think we've all tried to figure out why we're going through this very bizarre time I think Davis view of how he is balancing his portfolio is that he is accepting a lot of very conservative gigs for example with turning-point USA or Prager you or going on Fox and then feeling is that he's balancing it by saying hey do you realize you guys just invited a gay man who smokes weed into your group and kudos to that for being tolerant so from his perspective yeah he's doing a lot of work with conservatives but he's constantly reminding them that they are changing and that they are becoming more tolerant if you walk if you like his view I think is is that he is making the the right more liberal now from a different perspective and in this is held by many people he is choosing repeatedly to punch tip left and to accept right-wing speaking engagements no right-of-center speaking engage and so from that perspective well then he's just really much more on the right and I think that he's agreed that he's moved right I don't think that's a question but I think it has to do with whether or not you view his balancing of this which is you know it's quite open about talking about being pro-choice at a conservative event and that is a way in which he is actually taking the left to the right as he fights the part of the left that he thinks is uh has taken the left down and you know I don't think he makes any bones about it he doesn't think the left is ever coming back I think he thinks the Democratic Party is finished so you know that's a debate that he and I have I don't think the Democratic Party is finished I think that we have to fight for its soul right now and so that's what what I think is sort of dividing people as is the Dave's rhetoric and Dave strategy is different than my strategy so you know do I like Dave strategy better than my strategy now you know I think he's doing something where he's you know going on more conservative programs and I would feel comfortable with I'm one of the issues that I see a lot of the criticisms of the left and I'm thinking particularly of Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson possibly because they're repeated so often they seem to be quite low resolution and do you agree and do you think we need higher resolution critiques of the left I I think I'm going to be making higher resolution critiques of the left because I haven't given up on the left if I weren't where they are where they think this is just gone you know metastatic and there's no saving it I think it's understandable why they would move to a lower resolution picture I think that the the real fear I have is is much more on the right that we had the right down to a couple of zealots with tiki torches and now the far left is going to antagonize ordinary human beings to moving farther and farther right to it to escape an attack on a reason and civility themselves so I think that this stylistic difference it's a difference in findings of fact I think that I am I'm much more optimistic this will bounce back and that we're in a period of madness and that the madness can't continue forever but if I thought the madness we're going to continue forever sure I might I might just dismiss the whole thing and I guess by higher-resolution critiques what I'm also thinking about is as far as I understand people only generally change their minds or even people only generally listen to you when you validate experience in terms of is that for example on the left your concern about unfairness is a valiant is a valid concern but I'm concerned I'm also worried about how that can turn into an ideology that then doesn't admit it becomes very simplistic whatever I mean that's that's what I would consider a more nuanced perspective what would you say is the girl that needs to be made look I've been trying to make this with URI to very little avail he wants to say there's more to the position of the left then we are giving it credit for my point is I I've always built that right the standard liberal left has a lot going for it and that the progressive left because the traditional progressive left has had a lot to learn for the new upgrade to my mind is where the problems begin and end is what I'm really interested in is beef be hyper specific what is it about the Glee with which we are canceling people we are terrifying people we are coming after livelihood we are trying to humiliate shame and ambiguous people so that they are terrified to speak out relatively garden-variety truths and then when they express fear we say oh come on nobody believes those really radical things maybe it's a few college kids with green hair somewhere in the northwest but and are you reacting I think this is what's coming across as gas lately meaning if when you say open borders do you mean open borders if you don't mean put orders don't say open borders if you mean open borders let's play through the consequences of what you're talking about you know if you really believe that every deviation from the percentage in a population and are you really bothered by wage gaps is that really what's bothering you because I can tell you that in high fashion modeling I think it favors women by like ten to one's a men are getting paid ten cents on the dollar I don't think anybody seriously cares about that except as an oddity I don't think anybody's mystified as to why it's happened the key problem is is that we've adopted these very strange speech patterns like hashtag kill all men what do you mean by hashtag kill all men oh I just mean it would be nice if a--world were a little better for women father I don't know it system some pattern of English usage that you know I think I think the appeal of it and the fun of it is to get grandpa to scratch his heads and say wow kids today and there is also the point being made the IDW needs to broaden beyond where it currently is and to move to have more conversations with people what reasonable leftists or people outside the kind of auntie left left-wing bubble you think that that's true you think those kind of conversations need to happen I'm just mystified by this I mean if you've got Weinstein in your group he seems to me to be pretty far to the left I don't think been Pierrot is afraid of having a conversation with Brett Weinstein I think that's not what the issue is the issue is do you want to have a pseudo conversation with somebody whose major point is to target like why would a boxer want to get into a ring with a gang member carrying a switchblade hey I don't get it it's not about boxing it's just about violating the rules and thinking that that's clever and cute so you know to the extent that somebody wants to agree on the rules they're probably not going to be representing the social justice war perspective I mean I don't want to use the use as an epithet if the person's point you is I want to use something other than reason and civility with which to talk to you because those are the tools of oppression we don't even know what conversation means I mean David I just think you have to appreciate this is a giant waste of time it's a pathetic squandering of political opportunity to do good forth for the very people work we're talking about whether that's trans people poor people people of color traditionally marginalized groups you know what we're talking about is trying to antagonize the far-right in it do four years of Donald Trump or something far more extreme that's how it looked me the only reason I'm finding this interesting is that I don't think it's interesting to torch the entire developed world on utopian social engineering experiments run by out of control the azov psychotics is it's just not a fitting end to the incredible experiment it is Western civilization which has finally come to terms with all of its problems and all of its benefits you know whether that's you know the advent of antibiotics or slavery or Jim Crow or nitrogen-fixing I mean there's just some problem with stupid being in charge this David this is gone on way too long and it's too weird it's too creepy and it has to do with the political economy of the baby boomer Davos whatever you want to call it bubble collapsing and pretending that this is actually some sort of a a an interesting intellectual left-wing movement with important points with people who can um who can make those points in an intelligent fashion without name-calling I haven't seen it most of the things that people are saying that are reasonable were part of the left before the current increase in vigilantes and he there's a part of this you know all of this identitarian stuff the intersectionality intersectionality was much more interesting when it was Crenshaw where was at UCLA log back in like the nineteen eight month you know baby may be unpacking knapsack and in the examination of unearned privilege coming out of Wellesley was initially interesting but it's it's metastasized into some kind of a cult-like thing and nobody it's not cults aren't interesting because you're just dying to understand them they're interesting because they've got your children and your future hostage right and you just want you want your family back and you want to start working on real issues when have problems you don't want to be afraid to simply observe what you see with your own eyes and ears and report on it and be told you know the your the love child of Adolf Hitler Benito Mussolini and Pol Pot Asst [Music] you
