[Music] another key concept from integral theory can perhaps resolve the well-known dispute between jordan peterson and sam harris but they couldn't even agree on the nature of truth Wilbur describes how reality can be viewed most accurately as four quadrants or four different lenses interior an exterior individual and collective the quadrants are equally valid but distinct each has its own rules for gathering knowledge and truths that apply only to the segment of reality it's focused on from this perspective Harris was insisting on a scientific objective definition of truth while peterson was more interested in a cultural definition truth as culturally agreed and transmitted through myth and story four integral both the right but incomplete famously jordan peterson and sam harris had these major debates some probably the most high-profile debates between atheism and religious belief and a lot of people said they were really fascinating conversations but on in some sense it sounded like they were talking past each other and i know you have this concept of different forms of truth and the different quadrants of truth could you briefly explain do you think that helps to explain what was going on yeah and if so how sure we talked about the good to true in the beautiful we talked about manual counts three critiques we talked about your you're gonna orbit masters as three validity claims and said that those three are a a condensed version of four quadrants and what they really amount to is that the four quadrants means that you can look at any happening from in at least two major ways you can look at it from the inside or from the outside from a subjective view or from an objective view and you can look at it as an individual a singular event or a plural event so every individual human for example exists in a series of collectives and so if you put those together you get four quadrants you need the inside and the outside of an individual and a collective and all three of those are very real perspectives that show very real dimensions and those dimensions do turn out to be the foundation of those other items that I was mentioning I'd previously mentioned first second and third person perspective so the first person perspective we defined as the person who is speaking that's an i or we or me mine that's the interior of an individual what we call the upper left quadrant so that's an eye space and it would be your in our mosses validity claim for example of truthfulness or it would also be their beauty in the eye of the beholder or any of the subjective beliefs that you happen to have and that are true existing truths for you those exists together and collectives and so those aren't just subjective they're inter subjective and they involve not just me being aware of me but me also being aware of you for example so second person is defined as the person being spoken to so in this case you're a second person I'm talking so I'm first person and the goal of our dialogue in some sort of mutual discussion where your subjective space and my subjective space will resonate together closely enough that I can say I think I understand what you say I understand what you mean and you can look at me and say yeah I think I understand what you mean so we have a kind of mutual understanding that has to do not with individual truthfulness or individual aesthetics or beauty doesn't have to do with objective truth either it has to do with inter subjective values inner subjective goodness ethics how we treat each other as individual subjects would that be more Jordan Peterson than relative to Sam Harris yes yes they do you tend to emphasize different quadrants we're Sam even though he'll say things like consciousness is real conscious is the only thing that can't be doubted you can look at consciousness in a kind of objective way and there are subjective truths that kind of stuff he still has a tendency to interpret what that means from a third-person deterministic fashion so he'll say things like using Charles Whitmore the guy that got in the Texas tower and shot up a bunch of people he told his jailers that when he died doing autopsy because something was wrong with his brain and they did found a tumor and so Sam will say okay that's when we really understand everything about neural physiology we'll understand all of evil behavior just like this tumor is causing Whitmore to do that but just the problem with that is it's just too extremist a version of it because even if the tumor can get you towards really antisocial behavior it didn't say get in this particular tower at this particular time using this particular gun shoot exactly these many people cause exactly these many deaths but that's the deterministic mechanism that he demands in order to interpret what's arising and again that's just you have two fundamental unprovable choices about how you want to view relative world its ass arising and there either is the creative advance into novelty or there isn't and I find the creative advance into novelty much much more reflective of the world as it is arising and in terms of any sort of ultimate truth that's where they're waking up the traditions simply come down and say actually you can't say anything about the relative world in in an ultimate truth because all of our concepts make sense only in terms of their opposites the pleasure pain good/bad infinite finite up down in out so all of our concepts based on opposites but ultimate reality has no opposite so we really can't conceptualize it and the real genius of mahayana buddhism guy named the gardener basically came out and his whole notion of emptiness is that you can't literally say anything about the relative world that will end up being absolutely true because you'll always end up contradicting yourself so he had a very very sophisticated dialectic it basically said take any characteristic you want it can be free will or it can be terminus 'm it can be consciousness or it can be matter it can be truth or it can be falsity and call that X and then he demonstrates that the reality actually is neither X nor non X nor both nor neither nothing you can say about the world is ultimately correct including what I just said and including what I just said there and that too and the whole point of negara and all of my honor Buddhism anniversary all the world's mystics agree is that in order to see this ultimate reality you have to directly experience it you actually waken it yourself and until that happens everything you say about it's wrong because you're just not in touch with it so you can say oh it's God it's not God it's atheistic because it doesn't matter you still don't know it so everything you're saying is ultimately not right and you keep doing that until you awaken the second mode of knowing that plugs you in to this direct first-person experience of a ground of all being that's called enlightenment that's called awakening and so on and that really is a mystery and that's when the guards are called it emptiness easy it can need to be called void nor not void but in order to point it out we call it the void and the whole point of that is you keep doing these meditative practices until you awaken that mode of awareness and then you have this direct experience and it can neither be described as deterministic or freewill causal or free and that's the ultimate state of a Buddhist or mystical orientation so we'll be getting those kinds of arguments that's at least one thing worth keeping in mind you can still give your relative arguments about which seems to work best in the relative realm and that's why I say that a creative advance into novelty turns out to be probably the best way to describe that and so even somebody like Daniel Dennett who is often argued with sam Harris Gannett maintains that evolution does produce a degree of increasing degrees of freedom or what he'll call Evatt ability as opposed the inevitability which is determinism and evolution produces degrees of freedom and those are very real and even Sam will say I'm not even sure I can explain the difference between me and Daniel because he realizes if you actually push that deterministic position it really gets into into problems and doesn't work very well the whole notion of some degree of freedom that in itself is very hard to describe adequately because as soon as you say what that free choice is you can always come up or some something that preceded it and it was outside of your control and so you never really looked like you have freedom but again you can do the same thing to that opposite belief because you're both just you're arguing opposites in a world that ultimately is is beyond opposites but Mike Murphy quotes an evolutionary biologist who went back to look at the evolutionary record and attempted to determine the number of genuine transformations that occurred in that evolutionary unfolding and a transformation is defined as as the introduction of an emergent quality and emergent means new means it never happened before means that nothing like it happened before it's radically novel it's probably the creative advancing into novelty course they're interesting is that I don't know how this person came up with this but the number of minor transformations in evolution were six hundred thousand the number of major transformations and I don't know what the distinction was between that but that was between twenty and a hundred but the point is there's a there's newness emerging in this evolutionary stream and that's how we went from just simple quarks to the sauna so Shakespeare the undeniable fact of that is it novelty it's just all over the bloody place and if you have strict determinism you can't get that it's not going to happen and so you just have to end up making a choice you just sort of stare at science and say well it looks like every event has a cause you run into the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and it says no it doesn't is actually probabilistic so determinist determinism is strictly shot right there anyway or you acknowledge that however this happens there is a creative emergence of novelty and you're having thoughts right now that in part are emergent they're a bit of newness that's never ever ever happened before and even if we knew all of the factors in your brain and everything else is affecting you and by the way you were affected by a billion other factors all of which have to be determined in order for that to happen even if we knew all of that there's still a capacity that novelty is going to emerge in your case they only happen six hundred thousand times in evolution and even sam harris has at least six novel ideas before breakfast and he acts that way so that kind of argument just sort of goes back and forth and back and forth and you can get very bright people like Dennett arguing very similar to sam harris like sam says he really can't tell the difference between him and done it but then it argues four degrees of freedom and sam argues for not what happens with the Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson is how they come down on that side of this ultimate mystery of what's happening and however much Sam acknowledges that ultimate unity consciousness and its subjectivity is real and all of that he does tend to come down on the side of third-person objective realism and so if we could know all of brain Neri neurophysiology at some point he specifically says then we would understand all of evil and presumably be able to fix that and again that's just pushing it way way way too far and that's what peterson will do he won't push it that far in that direction so he's always coming up with these factors that have a different type of truth value and we said earlier that there were a narrow version of truth isn't the good the true and the beautiful and that was just sort of a narrower objective truth but that all three of them could be considered different types of truth in the broad sense and that's what Peterson is always acknowledging and so I think one of the weinstein brothers came up in the nursing metaphoric truth however we want to consider it there are truths that don't come down to just third-person objective exterior realistic truths and those are very very real realities and if nothing else how we get to those is different from how we get to a mere objective understanding so how we understand that atoms make up molecules is different in terms of how we understand what you and I should be doing in both senses there's an overall type of truthfulness to whatever we're saying there's an isness to whatever we're saying so even if my values arise in my awareness if I'm aware of them they have an isness they exist they're phenomenologically real and so I can say well that's the isness that's real and then in same is true for the good the true the beautiful they all have an isness factor and that's what Sam the focus is on because he'll just say well we're just navigating through this world and we just make choices and these are better or worse but there are things that are ultimately true and he focuses on the business of that and that's what we should that's what we should go for and again that's that's fine but the methods that you get to those is those are still different and that's harbormaster's validity claims it is the good that you are in the beautiful it is quadrants and Sam is focusing on those right-hand exterior or purses and Jordan acknowledges those but he's always coming up with some very real left-hand how in terms of values and I don't necessarily agree with all he says but I absolutely agree with his addressing that dimension and that issue because that is real that is there and that cannot be reduced objective science it's very interesting because Jordan Peterson Sam Harris had a two-hour conversation where they couldn't agree about the definition of truth I know I know can you can you explain why they couldn't agree well yeah because they they couldn't there each talking from a different one of these perspectives and the fact is all four of those are correct that's the whole point about an integral approach is that everybody is right and so again it's not who's right and who's wrong it's how they all fit together and these were two relatively good arguments being given for some very different truth perspectives and they were both right and that's why there's there's this kind of begrudging agreement they'll both see the other person's argue and go well I can't really disagree with that but here's the part that's not being included and then they'll talk about their perspective truths and how it is different from this one and so they're saying something that's not getting included in the other person's argument and they'll go okay but then often the other side will say well I don't disagree with that it's just here's this other stuff that you're not including and this aren't went back and forth in back and forth and you see in a sense the same thing with Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris and their argument on free will they agree on almost everything in a certain sense about neurophysiology but one of them is arguing from a first-person perspective where one of the phenomenological realities that you have mostly is a type of free agency you don't experience hard to Turman ism but something like a manual can't he wants to get you from a position that he considers unfree which is hetero no me in other is your other directed your thoughts are your own you're a conformist you're a part of the herd mentality you're governed by other people's thoughts and you can tell if that's happening you don't have to wait way down the road when we understand all of neurophysiology and can you explain all of evil behavior according to sam harris whether you know the all of the functioning of neurophysiology you do know if you're being a conformist or if you doing what Kant wants you to do which is to be not hetero no me but aa tana me yourself determining in the sense of you're creating your own thoughts you're having your own viewpoints you're not conformist you're not other determined and one of the major forms of the free will determinism argument is that one version of determiners it means just certainly hard determinism that means absolutely everything is determined and again Sam doesn't actually believe that but he does tend to fall back on giving us examples from that type of thing and making those types of claims and so when he argues against free will he's actually arguing there's a fairly well-known philosopher highly respected his last name's pronounced differently but it's spelled P L AM T ing a Alvin latina however you pronounce that and he points out there what sam harris is arguing against is what alvin calls maximal autonomy and Alvin points out that did almost none of the believers in free will believe that there's maximal autonomy that just means you radically free and have no constraints on you whatsoever almost everybody that believes in some sort of free will believe that there are constraints and in integral review we have what's called a cosmic address which is simply when you add up all of the various dimensions that a particular hole on is that what is quadrant is where the tsavo is where this line is where the state of consciousness is what it's type is that gives you it's sort of location in this manifest universe and all of those constrain your activity right now they're all determining it to some degree in that sense but then there's also a degree of freedom within that and that can't be reduced to just just determinism so the idea of freedom is free agency which is what Jordan peterson and Denon tend to argue is that thieves can't Spurgeon even right now even if we don't know all of neurophysiology whether it's determined or not we do know if we're being conformist or for acting more on our own wishes and desires we can tell that right now we know if we're doing that right now or not and if we do become more autonomous then we are freer from the constraints and demands of a herd mentality and a hetero no --mess existence which is not a very creative autonomous individual existence and we can do that whether or not there's brain determinism or not I mean maybe my brain is totally determined right now I can still make that choice and the one is free and the other isn't free so that's the type of free will arguments that most believers in free will argue it's not what Sam tends to argue he tends to argue this hard determinism then with a maximal autonomy not very many people do that during Peterson's not doing that and Daniel Dennett's not doing that so what Sam is tending to do is fall back on these right-hand exterior third-person perspectives that do tend to look more deterministic strictly deterministic what's Peterson is doing is arguing from these interior subjective and inter subjective dimensions that are also very real and cannot be determined according to merely objective exterior realism categories and so they really are in that sense even though they do find that if they kind of push into each other that they there's some real sort of core agreements they really are differentiating in large measure according to these different quadrants these different perspectives that they are taking as most fundamentally real they acknowledge the others but they tend to to really come back and emphasize those particular perspectives especially when the other person isn't including them and that tends to be the way the argument goes is Sam will argue that that's just not right and then Jordan will say well that's just not right and so they get into that kind of lockup now even though they both sort of acknowledge the existence of all of them but one of the real fundamental differences is just that they're coming from these different perspectives those different perspectives are real and each different perspective shows a real dimension of reality it really exists it's really there and you can't argue it away and that's why they don't ever really give up on the argument I mean this is really just totally obvious it wouldn't be a perennial unsolvable philosophical question in the West like the mind-body problem primary quality and the primary problem in all those those are really fundamental issues in part because it does come down to that mystical notion that ultimately all of these concepts are based on opposites and ultimate reality isn't an opposite so you're always going to get caught up in these kinds of argument and you're never going to be able to argue them fully the only way you're gonna be able to know the real answer to any of that is to experience that pure ground and then that will solve the issue for you in a direct and immediate sense [Music] you [Music]
