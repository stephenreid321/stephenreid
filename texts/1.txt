[Music] if it's a real pleasure to to speak you run the intellectual explorers podcast in Toronto so in a kind of similar place with the podcast and the people that you're interviewing sort of some of the same people that we've interviewed you've interviewed on your podcast and you also wrote this amazing piece that went kind of viral in the circles that that we both move in called mimetic tribes tried to give a sort of greater definition to what's going on below in the sort of culture what you've called culture war 2.0 could you describe briefly what the thesis of that piece was I guess it's prudent to describe what a culture war is right and put simply it's a war to define what's sacred and profane in society or culture and culture at one point it happened in the 90s people like Pat Buchanan and religious right kind of fighting by secular left and using international relations terms sort of like them bipolar war we had two left and the right and we make the speculation that culture war 2.0 is what they call a multipolar war it's a fragmented war it's no longer left and right it's a multitude of what we dub the mimetic tribes fighting each other in order to control the narrative of our culture can you outline some of those tribes maybe that might Ellis trace it a little bit more people maybe describe what a memetic tribe is describe what a meme is first what people popularly known as a meme is those images that go viral of a cat or whatever and meme and the Richard Dawkins sense when he coined it in The Selfish Gene is a unit of information that wants to replicate itself and when memes take team and they team up they call it a meme Plex and that enhances its ability to replicate so a religion or an ideology it could be described as a meme Plex and so a memetic tribe is the idea that people are becoming tribal around me Lexa's and we listed this the spreadsheet that has about 30 different mimetic tribes and some examples would be social justice activists or me to black life matters the alt-right the old light neo reactionaries manosphere rationalist post rationals new atheist there's a slew of them and we argue that where we speculate that these tribes are fighting amongst each other internally as well as externally and I know one of those tribes was the intellectual dark web right yeah I'd like to hear your take on the intellectual dialogue first because I'd like to talk about sort of where it might be going and kind of air critique of of it as well right right so the way I view it is it was sort of we were talking about this offline about a placeholder tribe that was sort of pushing back on some of the social justice activists or kind of a coalition of the woek tribe me too black lives matter and they were trying to fight for I guess they're pushing back against blank slate ISM and fighting for reason in science and and promoting that as a sacred value in our culture with that can't be compromised in free speech obviously and so I view it as sort of yeah pushing back against blank slate ISM but more more reactionary a more reactionary tribe it's responding to sort of this push of woke nests in the culture yeah and this is something that I even said to to Eric and he really didn't like my use of the word reactionary because the the unifying factor for the people that were originally considered to be in the IDW was this sort of sense of reacting to something in the culture now you could argue that that needs to be reacted against but my question is whether it's being reacted against in a way that sort of drags the conversation up to a new level or whether it drags it down into the more polarizing kind of being at before or anti social justice whereas what I what I see is the necessary kind of move is to say the values that you care about fairness being the principal one they're hardwired into it some hike talks about like these are values that are important to everyone but there are other values that are also important and also that any value system when taken to extremes and becomes an ideology can't become self-defeating and that's sort of that's the nuance of the conversation that I see that is being lost especially when you have people like Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin who at times can slip into very simplistic critiques of the left I feel that what's required is a much more nuanced critique that kind of takes us up to a new a new level in the discourse right and that resonates a lot my to be charitable someone like David Rubin or Jordan Peterson I think if you are embattled in this culture war right you potentially stop evolving or looking for that kind of liminal space where you can push yourself at the edge of your map of reality and you're pushing back against another mean Plex and so from looking at it from the outside it might looks taken right it might not be evolving this intellectual dark web but maybe that battle between the intellectual dark web and these world tribes is evolution itself and we're sort of is someone who's studying this kind of the warring tribes of culture war 2.0 where do you get the sense that the the IDW kind of needs which is a relatively new tribe what do you think that it kind of is it is right now like part of me sees it as sort of an engineered tribe and when something gets engineered and doesn't manifest organically there's sort of a deadness to it right so maybe it was born to die and maybe it was just sort of a temporary tribe they needed to push back and create some space where either dialogue could ensue you know I don't personally find it interesting and I think a lot of people are not finding it interesting there's this quote that by the post rationalist I really like they say that it's better to be interesting and wrong than right and boring right because being interesting and wrong inspires others to be right in the future so with that whole white paper I'm not attached to it but the idea is to provide an interesting speculation for others to play with and I think that is where all the live players are going to be operating in in that kind of sandbox environment and I know we've talked about the idea of the intellectual deep web as a kind of place for the intellectual dark web to go next I mean my sense of the intellectual dark web is I was really excited by it when it first emerged because there's a quality of conversation that felt very alive and very emergent thinking about sort of Brett and Eric Weinstein on the Rubin report and then a conversation between Jordan Pederson and Ben Shapiro about religious truth that also seemed to be kind of scaffolding each other's thought and moving in a direction there was a sense of an emergent conversation and me personally I've been slightly disappointed with the lack of that sense in the IDW conversations probably for a over eight months maybe a year or so and this sense of everyone almost starting to stagnate in their positions and just repeating themselves more and more and not getting this sense of an emergent synthesis of conversation that maybe was promised when it first arrived it's like its audience they have an audience now right and it's almost a business [Music] speaking against certain mean plexes and ideologies are speaking for free speech just to speak personally I just am somewhat bored by the dialogue and I've been for a while and you mentioned the intellectual deep web that's something that excites me right and I don't think it's been established yet this mimetic tribe this intellectual deep web the other tribe but it's it's calling out you know and the way I look at it is a more embodied tribe you know someone who kind of it's like a spiritual embodiment of the ideas where the intellectual dark web is just sort of a ragtag group of people pushing back against this will yeah I want to pick up on that because that's I think we both have a sense like of what is needed to in the kind of emergent conversation to move forward and this kind of intellectual deep where idea brings in those thinkers for me it's people like John Vevey key who's talking about kind of deliberately integrating the wisdom traditions and the much more embodied knowing it's people like stan grof with the kind of integration of like really cutting-edge psychedelic thinking psychedelic therapy it's people like Richard tarnis who I've been hugely influenced by it's people like it's also the people sort of on the fringes of the critiquing the sort of the Western materialist model so people like Rudolf Steiner Carl Jung obviously was already being kind of brought in through Jordan Peterson I say Jordan Pederson is more intellectual deep web than an intellectual dark web almost because he is bringing this kind of liminal space and the idea of integration of mythopoetic sand so I think he he he would be one figure that I would see it as being part of both of those I'm not sure he strikes me as a potential bridge so who are the other figures that you would put into this kind of emerging constellation like I'm not 100% sure right but John rebecky definitely Ken Wilber and again this this intellectual deep web well what comes to mind is is mmm there might need to be an intellectual meta web and I think we were talking about this right because what I'm doing in Toronto this intellectual Explorers Club the idea there is to view different maps of reality on their own terms and have the capacity to articulate it back to them to the point where they feel fully understood right and just hold that space hold all those different maps of reality without any judgement without any kind of being seduced by any one of them and I think we need to be in that space kind of there's a dialogue all right an understanding because I think true understanding is an act of love and once we can get there how that capacity to understand another mean Plex and me intellectual deep web might naturally emerge but I don't think he can be predicted or engineered I've heard the phrase the trans paradigm attic mind is that does that fit in to like the idea that you can see a wall of all of these different and also it maps onto Ken Wilbur's integral and that very well the idea that you can see all of these value systems as containing some truth but there is also perspective that incorporates all of them rather than being in conflict because you're thinking that your truth is the only truth right right it's a yes end yeah what comes to mind there is you know all those mimetic tries we listed a lot of them it strikes me and again this is a lot of this would I talk about a speculation right I don't really hold on to this with with I hold on open with lightness but a lot of those mimetic tribes they seem like they come from an egoic space right it's like a zero-sum game that they're playing their map is right your map is wrong right where were these kind of these trans egoic tribes that are merging like integral theorists or post rationalist strands rationalists is this kind of placeholder of an intellectual deep web they seem trans egoic right and ego at tribes they view it as a culture war right where trans egoic tribes do and as a culture dance this is a part of the evolution and so any kind of thinker who views it as a cultural dances it's kind of like an evolutionary necessity I would say we belong to this potential intellectual deep web and Jordan Peterson do you think he's you do you think he's maybe a bridge between the two I don't know what Jordan Peterson is or what he's going to be about but he's obviously an important figure in this culture war cultural dance whether he likes it or not I think we've called him before one man lightning rod for the culture war so what you've called a culture war 2.0 why why 2.0 what do you think is different about this iteration the idea is sort of like a postmodern war right it's a multipolar war it's not about left or right these monolithic forces it's a multitude of memetic tribes competing and I like to term the noosphere collective consciousness right they're all kind of swimming in this space trying to dominate the narrative or the meta-narrative and we we speculate that they're there six crisis crises that led to this culture war 2.0 right one was the meaning crisis right and the other was the reality crisis and those two together kind of give you the is in the art right so the reality crisis tells you what what is what is the map of reality but if we can't have a consistent collective sense making capacities if we can't dialogue together and figure out what is true or even have a the same Epis Tamala G to arrive at truth then we have a reality crisis on our hands right and Scott Adams commonly talks about how there's like two movie screens where we kind of flirt with the idea that it's Netflix level variety of reality of tunnels that we're wrestling with and the meaning crisis gives us a not right what we should do with our lives and when you have one sort of religion or meta-narrative that dominates it kind of creates internal coherence with society but if you have a bunch of them competing with each other then that's a crisis right the other ones we have a belonging this crisis where people don't feel like they're they're connected with each other there's a warfare crisis going on which is with the internet some speculate that we're in a fourth World War and it's a memetic war whether it's sort of memetic mercenaries like Cambridge analytic ah Russians hacking or Chinese hacking the United States government but everyone can be a memetic warrior in this kind of ecology that we're operating in if this is a wool what do you think of the key from it so out of the 36 mimetic tribes that we listed and I mentioned a few already both social justice activists me too black life matters I'll write all that stuff you could say that there's and again this is me at the edge of my thinking there's there's two broad coalition's if you want to call the woke coalition and sort of this red pill coalition my map over to Jordan hauls the blue church red church I think those are the two driving forces currently in the in the culture war and they're fighting internally amongst themselves but they're also fighting themselves as well and I would say the one that has power is the woke coalition's because they dominate most media except Fox News and Breitbart they dominate a lot of our institutions HR departments PR departments politics and the red pill tried to soar like a gorilla warriors in a way some people would kind of pick you up at that point if I can you said they dominated politics when Trump is in power and right right and I should I should speak a little bit more nuanced they're they don't dominate all politics but they dominate sort of the liberal parties but yeah you're a hundred percent right that the rightist parties are sort of red pill in a way and I would say these these two broad coalition's the woke coalition they kind of use virtue extortion ISM I like this term that I'm flirting with and you know the Mafia if they wanted to get money from a business they break a few windows and we'll protect you right so if you're not virtue signaling a certain way then you're at risk of being called a racist sexist whatever right and that's a form of power where people on the the red pill right it's more or I would say virtue terrorism you know in a sense rein where they engage in online harassment if somebody is critical Jordan Peterson whether it's in bad faith or good faith they can be attacked by trolls and in the worst case as in cells who engage in actual terrorism so those are this virtue of extortion ISM and virtue terrorism we're kind of two ways this culture wars and being engaged in but one thing it's not happening is dialogue genuine dialogue between the two and some may say this could be what Robert focalin calls a deep disagreement something that can't be reconciled or it's just bad faith actors engaging in in combat do you have a sense of where this is going at the moment do you have a sense of that there is do you see much hope that this this could be resolved I like this term called existential Hope the idea and you know I'm as you know I'm a kind of practicing stoic and I operate the stoic community in Toronto and there's this thing called the Stockdale paradox and John Stockdale or the James Stockdale he was a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War and when he crashed his plane he was playing got shot down and he says I'm having a date with Epictetus one of the prominent Stoics and he practiced his stoicism when he was a captive and he noticed something that the the soldiers who were held captive that kind of set a time line towards being released gave into nihilism they gave up they gave hope and he noticed the healthy balance to have is to have this ridiculous hope that your situation will be resolved that you know heaven will arrive but be absolutely realistic about the brute facts of your situation you don't know when you're gonna get out right so holding that tension between that existential Hope and then that kind of that gritty reality right and when I have those moments you know possibilities open up and one thing I'm flirting with right now going back to this potential of intellectual deep web and how they don't view it as a culture war but they view it as a cultural dance how can people playing in this space dance so seductively that they want others to dance with them or how do you have you make the meta space cool enough that people want to want to go that right yeah and so in Daniel thorn from the emerge podcast we were talking about this that one thing that I'm almost allergic to these days is this kind of like certainty that's radical certainty which a lot of medic tribes and kind of the Chieftains in it have and I love being uncertain these days right and there used to be a sense of anxiety when I held this uncertainty but now it feels I'm very comfortable with it and there's this term called the the gray pill I don't need it kind of like map it out the the blue pill red pill analogy from the matrix right they got repurposed by some of the reactionary tribes but if you you're kind of born into a blue pill you don't take it right and that's kind of consensus reality then you take a red pill then you're kind of shown the harsh truths of reality but then the gray pill is sort of muddying the waters of your red pill truths right it's kind of dancing with nuance and you can get an existential crisis if you take a gray pill but if you kind of sit with it long enough it starts becoming fun and sexy and you don't know where you're going you don't know what will emerge so how can we make uncertainty sexy right that's kind of like something I'm thinking about and how can you be confident with yourself with uncertainty hmm I guess there's something around aesthetics and fun like how can you have more fun in the kind of meta tribe that then encourages more people to want to join and the aesthetics around that as well which is something we think about a lot like for me there's this sort of the more meta tribe embraces what we've talked about before like the more embodied practices the personal growth background that I come from as well like I see as absolutely core to that because you've got to be able to hold complexity you've got to be able to kind of be in much more aware of your inner processes while you're having conversations to avoid cutting getting hijacked limbic hijack and Migdal hijack all of those things so there's there's a there's a big part of that right and I do think that you know the aesthetics is a Trojan horse to get into that deep stuff and what I like about rebel wisdom is you guys are engaged and a wealth of kind of spiritual and and kind of psychotherapeutic modalities right and I think that is key to engage in that these these modalities because there's something that this term of flirting with is the outrage portal right we no longer have a culture we're in an outrage portal right outrage porn is what connects us the longer shared values or whatever right whether it's on the left or the right we're all an iPhone away from being on the casting couch of the culture war whereas producers by sharing memes on Twitter but we're also it's um you know stars we never know when we're gonna be cast into it and but in order to be a participant in this culture or this outrage porno you got to be a dick an addict right in some capacity and if you kind of remove that impulse to for addiction which what you guys are doing then you might peek your head an outrage porno and they won't have real sex yeah and there's I don't know if it's just because of what I'm interested in but the most interesting conversations I think we've had on the channel of being with people who are also sensing this drive towards that we have to get down into the how we have these conversations as much as what we're talking about and and and the necessity for getting into this sort of collective expect of intelligence space like Jamie wheel talks about Jordan Green all talks about daniel trachtenberg er those kind of that there seems to be a destination to the intellectual exploration and it's it's coming together in a much more nuanced way in the sort of space of coherence which I think can only happen from this more meta perspective right and three things come to mind and I don't know how they're related to what you just said but I think intuitively they are there's just one term called meta communication that I quite like right it's being sensitive to not only the content that's being exchanged but their relationship right and being able to call out each of those and have a discussion about it right so just step out of the interaction and talk about interaction itself another term I like is conversational narcissism right and then there's two components to that there's the shift response and the support response and so let's say you tell me that you went to Cuba and then I say well great what you do there right that's the support response the shift response is turning it back to myself right anyway like oh I remember the time I went to Cuba and you know you're talking to a narcissist or at least a conversational nurses they're pathologically use the shift response right and I operate a lot of could you explain that again I'll just describe what that is sure so the shift response so conversational narcissism is someone who constantly shifts the conversation back to themselves the offense decline of someone who does that yeah they the authentic relating community they have an appendage term for it like asking interested questions versus asking interesting questions so an interesting question is inquiring into the person that you're genuinely interested in but asking an interesting question points the finger back on you right and that's that's what kind of conversational narcissism do and when I'm in Toronto I have a lot of these impersonal in-person communities where we have a lot of like in the book clubs to base and stuff like that and there's always a couple of characters who are constantly pointing the fingers back at themselves by making these kind of interesting statements and they usually don't have the space to hold someone else's reality tunnel right and there's ways to kind of break into that like we were kind of playing with this modality called the anti debate so if we have opposing disagreements you tell me your position and I repeat your position back in my own words until you feel fully understood and we can only go to the next stage if you say I feel fully understood but if you like if I only got 50% of what you said then I have to repeat that 50% to you say you feel fully understood and only then I can give my disagreement and then when you hear my disagreement you repeat my disagreement back and your own words tell I feel fully understood right and so it's like a sense making debate and you're Trojan horsing a real dialogue between two people who can't dialogue it is really like couples therapy at the Raj Aryan argument so that's one way I find to get over the conversational narcissism so it's interesting that you use the Yeats poem as your the last pee bit in your piece that the center cannot hold mere anarchy is released upon the world because that of all the that just seems to resonate so clearly and I've had it kind of come to mind several times I've sort of thought about what's going on in do you think the center can hold or not I think maybe we're faced with two paths right or the center can't hold and maybe it shouldn't hold and we're kin and we have to unify come together find common ground as they say maybe the most heavenly existence could be found in either one of those possibilities I don't know but I think that's the choice that we're heading towards [Music] you [Music]
