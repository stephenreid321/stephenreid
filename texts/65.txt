[Music] you've been spending quite a lot of time quite a lot of your life I guess investigating this kind of spirituality atheism and your new book is actually called spiritual atheist so I think this is a really interesting place to start there just been some very high-profile interactions meetings between Jordan Peterson and sam Harris discussing exactly these topics the renewal of religion versus atheism and I kind of thought that one of in a way I see they're talking past each other a lot of the time yeah but also that the idea of kind of spiritual atheism as an expanding the concept of atheism beyond what it is as a kind of pure negation of religion and integrating science and saying well actually these things are not opposed to each other could be a way through in my experience of the religion versus science war you could call it is really a walk as it's two positions and I think the a the atheism that we've seen for the last 50 years has become a very specific type of atheism I don't think it's all atheism I don't think it's weig theism was when Francis Bacon who was the purveyor of the scientific method wrote a book on atheism a heathens become essentially materialism or materiality what I call materials atheism it's a it's a species of atheism which is very against anything that's not measurable in matter that doesn't it's anything that mean what a theism has to be and I guess what I've been trying to find as a form and expression of atheism that fits with my love of science my belief in reason my belief in my mind my belief in Internet my belief in proving things as the best we can with science whilst acknowledging that science has always been a project focused on matter and it hasn't ever wanted to speak about consciousness and the inexperience of our lives and the subjective experience it's likely not to it very early on it so I'm not going to do this doesn't meet doesn't exist we're just not going to include it inside and I believe spiritual a theism is I guess evidence-based the evidence of science is obvious I don't have to go into that net source of atheist evidence base but I believe that there's an evidence base for spiritual experience which is millions of years of what thousands of years of traditions exploring if you go inside crying you're busy busy mind intellect find out how to access this heart area which I will call the metaphor nursery of the heart but the experience of thinking from here not from hit this little bit here then evidence the evidence shows you that you will experience some form of unity ecstatic or quiet continuation into continuous nests but weenie and other which is transformational it changes everything about your life the one is a spirit whatever you wanna call it however you get there and there's ten different ways to get there but it does once you've had that experience it becomes a organizing truth that then re aligns everything around it and what I had to do myself as how do I make peace with this becoming the organizing principle of my inner life but still have science being the organizing principle of the external world which I don't argue with because it's brilliant that's what I've sort of been working on is how do you transcend those two positions because always you get just talking pastor you get the Atheist staying an atheist maybe they admit to meditation being useful from a instrumental sense of stress and whatever and maybe they admit to ritual being really good and like you get the kind of new churches the Atheist churches but when the congregation comes but they won't ever admit to a mystical truth and then you get the richest person going well I just believe in some kind of revealed truth and science is useful and everything and they're both right you have to find a way to lift them higher which is ultimately what spirituality or wisdom is about which is about finding opposites and then bringing them into harmony with each other as Heraclitus one of the pre-socratic Greek philosophers said you think those things are different but actually they're part of one thing and he called it a Pavan tonic harmony create attention and I think that's the job is how do I get myself every individual how do I get to a place where I can embrace what science has to say it really does work it's really useful keeps us alive but it can never answer questions about this thing it does tell this doesn't wasn't meant to doesn't design to and when you get some like Daniel Dennett the the philosopher saying that even the consciousness through which I expressed this thought and write my book is an illusion you know that's something not right there you know it just doesn't it's just purely from a pragmatic point of view but in a way he's followed through this materialist like an you see he's thought things through to the logical logical conclusion and isn't scared of the conclusions he's reached it's like yes if if this is the where this materialism has left me then I am going you've got to admire his kind of dedication to the logical if you're going to think of thought you have to follow it through and if that part of all philosophy has to be if I hold this to be true I need to make sure I've got rid of all what do you call them like little doubles of potential self contradiction which is which is what's really interesting about the times now because certainly online and I think also in in the among the gatekeepers of the media for quite a long time these this sort of I call them the Four Horsemen of the of the atheist or the Four Horseman Daniel Dennett Hitchens Richard Dawkins and sam Harris kind of this sort of very strong materialist atheist been held sway and what's really interesting especially with the kind of success of Jordan Pederson but more generally is I see a lot of people online starting to lease say I now appreciate religion for the first time I now appreciate spirituality for the first time I was an atheist and now I my conceptions of what religion is for and the reality that it's pointing to is is deepened which is a really interesting time it feels like there is an opportunity for a new synthesis arising which is why I think the spiritual atheist perspective is interesting there definitely is I think I'm out there a lot in the world I teach a lot of people this kind of stuff from a practical point of view I spend a lot of time doing leadership work which is really very pragmatic is it's an organization wanting its people to perform better and yeah it's a dangerous line for me to be talking about some of these content because there's a separation between church and state which basically means corporation and religion they don't shouldn't be involved you know if you want me to be in your company it's great but don't put me on a Christian program that would be outrageous like so therefore don't put me on a leadership program that's got some guy talking about spirituality and love and because I see that as religion so I always be very aware of that and you know respectful of that separation but I can't do my job Papa Eunice like teach people about this unit unit of experience of oneness and what then emerges in your body in a very body practical way it's fittings of love it's like oh my god I feel love because another word for love is truth another word for love is purpose so if you want a corporation we want to be a public organization which most 21st century companies that say that there's no way of getting and avoiding the conversation eventually has to come around or something you call up you can put a passion compassion caring but they're just ways of avoiding the reality which is we're talking about loving the world loving our consumers you know this is a big conversation same with leaders you can't talk about being a generous service-oriented servant leader without talking about caring for your team which is love again right so it's a really fine line but what I've noticed in the last two or three years is I'm now I almost void it more than I need to because people are asking me but don't you mean talking about love but I won't use it until use it but but there's a demand there's a yearning and I think the challenge I think I've got we've got at the moment is how do we ensure in the world without religion cuz I'm quite active religious I've got that part of my mother militant atheism is very much alive in me it's if I feel any kind of rulebook anyone saying this is the pathway rather than a pathway this is the model and you see it across the whole parcel developments spiritual space is you see people hurrying towards religion you see people putting people into guru / priest mode so I'm like that stuff I feel like sick with it so for me the question is how do you reinsure in the world without religion in its to organize sense it has to come from individual it has to come from inside and it's a it's a it's the I think it's a great topic of the next 20-30 years and another really interesting topic you've talked about in the past is the idea of the J curve which is something I think is a huge relevance now especially where a lot of us have the sense that things are breaking down and I'll let you explain the Jay Cove in more detail but the idea is that you cannot move from one state to another without going through a dissolution and a lot of people struggle with that dissolution because I say we're here we want to move to here yes but you have to britainís this goes with personal growth as well if you want if you want to improve how you are in the world and you have to give up you'll put some parts of your personality that we're working okay go into chaos before you can come out the other side and that's a really interesting subject I think it's a really interesting model it's almost a I think it's an essential thing for people to know if you want to change anything expect them to get worse first can you can you can you describe that so the tradition the material a of looking at change is linear so as you say you want thing I'm here now my life's okay my Lycians okay but not really intimate and not really conscious and that really juicy I want to make them more conscious and juicy I just wanna go from here to here and the great tragicomedy of life does I believe it's designed in prevented by who go into that core topic but it's designed into our system human and therefore all systems political organizational before you get from where you are to this better place and when I say better I don't so do you mean externally validated is better I mean for me if better as a fit a better fit with the world but to fit with your lover and your child your company the way the world's moving you have to first go down and that down movement is the dissolution as you say of old archetypes of our personality structures of our belief systems and ultimately of feelings then you touch something new something emerges in that moment which is fresh we call it an epiphany an insight a realization our ha and then you go up and try and build that into your everyday life you know everyday work you everyday patterning which takes often months and years but you gave me lots to talk about so the bit I want to talk about is I was I was lost and now I'm found you know the two end points of the curve the curve of this transformational curve J curve break the curve use different words which also maps on to the hero's journey he makes enjoy everything learning curves of learning it maps on to entrepreneurship you know startup companies have to first spend a lot of money and maybe they come out with a product that works and they can make a lot of money but for five years someone has to have trust and faith that they're going to do that it also maps onto political theory so old duck dictatorships to break down but it doesn't mean something gonna be all wonderful democracy it's pretty gonna be years of chaotic stuff that's what you're seeing at the moment is people trying to get away from that because it's painful but not in the direction of newness in the direction of wholeness make Britain slash America great again there's a ton of return to the old point you're in which can never be relived because it's gone time-based and in there whether it's your personal journey of change or whether it's trying to change the world we have to be okay with things being disassembled but the key is to have the center hole and for me and this is why I was reluctant spiritual present the only thing I've found that can keep this into holding and I mean that in the most philosophical and most pragmatic sense literally how to feel okay in the middle of a breakdown of your old life verse also how to feel okay as the u.s. disk instructs itself and hopefully something new comes is what we would call spiritual which is love which is connection which is this sense of oneness it's the only thing I know that's bigger than the fear the chaos of disassembly because the only thing you can really trust is what you go deep enough inside yourself to find or what that's part of it but the I guess from a philosophical point of view the only truth that I found that can't be deconstructed by cynicism skepticism is is this truth of oneness so that's poly surface pathetically is the truth of oneness emotionally it's the feeling of oneness we've labeled love some people say love is the truth love is the massive love is the answer what they're saying is the only thing that remains when you break down all your old patterns that you used to survive life to deal with your mum and dad until there's the pain of existence when all that dissolved the only thing that's left that you can hold on to is this experience of oneness / / / connection which is what we call spiritual so I didn't want to be in the spiritual world I don't want to be a spiritual teacher I didn't want to be anything to do with this thing it's the least cool career if you bro up in London in the 90s and you go to Cambridge University in study science it is the least cool thing in the world I mean literally but it was the only truth that I kept going back to over and over and over again and often I would for years I would discount it I would get rid of books I had I would laugh at yoga and meditation and as but it came after me until I accepted it in I couldn't get out my own Jacob I was stuck down the bottom over and over again reliving depression reliving anxiety reliving old patterns shield background as you said in science but also in philosophy yes I studied science first promise to be a medic medical science then I was very lucky I was given opportunity to spend a year doing something else and I chose philosophy of science and that was where I first had like a explosion of realizing that science isn't the only way of understanding the world and even thought of as if science can see that science is as much constructed as it is discovered so science isn't just discovering the truth of nature we also bring with us our own mind and concept in fact you can't understand data without concept Thomas Kuhn believe my mind Fuko the Scottish school of the construction of science theory and I'm not harken factionist I didn't believe all science is constructed by theory I believe there are data points which we call facts but to make sense of those facts you have to have narrative and narrative of conscious and narrative this choice of narrative of where the quantum theory you believe in the many-worlds interpretation where you believe in the mobium pilot-wave interpretation or the Copenhagen interpretation no fad will ever tell you which of those is real it's the Mason thing about Sciences and you we can't verify which because we're talking about something that's unverifiable so by some nature is always going to be a choice about what narrative structure we interpret the data in and that means science isn't just a pure fact it's constructed a little bit which is something that the traditional Four Horsemen of the Atheist apocalypse would net can't stomach and it's yes it's something that we have to be able to understand that science was designed to understand matter from the beginning when Galileo literally wrote and said I'm going to get rid of subjective experience not in brackets my brackets not because I don't think it's real and great to have feelings of love and awareness and awe but because we can't measure it it's never get another maybe measurable and therefore it's a pain in the ass for science let's just get rid of it and focus on what he called the primary qualities or primary properties that's what science is good at let's not force it to then become an arbiter of conscience and consciousness and the science of consciousness has always been what people call their wasn't editions and I guess we're in I hope a time where we've had such alert towards materialism certainly philosophically life and certainly in statehood the people are going this is too much is too much emptiness is too much externality I've got a life in here I want some meaning in this life the times we burn at the moment is do people then go right back into religion which in the US you have seen but what gives me hope is there's now a 25% group of people in the US who couldn't have spiritual not religious such as what I'm trying to give a philosophy for ultimately underpinning for because otherwise the problem you've got with spiritual not religious is well I cut you know I don't know I other it's called the fruit salad approach to spirituality is that you pick all the bits you like I want a like that Apple and a bit of cherry I like a bit tantrum like a bit of this chakra stuff and I like a bit of this stuff but I don't want all the other bits that come with that particular tradition which is transformation giving up the old challenging my belief structures challenging my ethics well integration of the shadow ethics I think that's the big issue of New Age life at the moment is you can fruit salad all the stuff you like the Bliss this and that's a big problem the blissing out of our spirituality because ultimately all if you stay in one tradition you end up having to do the shadow work because that's what they're designed to bring you into you right and that's painful when you need a lot of rigor and a lot of discipline and I think new a jury has gone in has just avoided it all and that's why so many atheists look at it and go what a pile of mumbo jumbo nonsense but also I think there's a it's partly that but I also think they put off by the kind of people it's not just it's not just what people are saying it's they look at people's actions in the world and think well if that spirituality I don't want a piece of that it's so much hypocrisy involved so by people who are only doing the bliss out thing and not doing the inner work I'm not doing the kind of recognition of I might be an angel but I'm also a demon correct and without that shadow integration it just means that if the whole thing is a trip of the of a blissful ego and that's why Christianity for example or the older wisdom traditions that do integrate that other side and at the core of them they have stories like Cain and Abel this is what happens if you get this resentful this is how this is what resentment begins being which in itself is a theological thing yes resentment against being on some deeper level like the way the people act in the world is a reflection of a deeper theological truth was something that really I guess reawakened in me a kind of respect for those with traditions hmm including Christianity yes interesting I guess Chris I see ironically of all the resolutions the wine least know about I think growing up as a Jew in a Christian society didn't massively enamor meter to the path but also listening to the but also many of these stories are in the Jewish tradition what that's the bit that uh me off the old testament the fire and brimstone and the anger and the disc God this a disembodied voice going wow I can now look at those texts and I can see wisdom in them but when they're taken literally and the connotation versus the denotation really when they're taken dinner you know the when we when we take the story of the story which is what most religions of the book actually still do they take the story as the story and miss out the metaphorical narrative mythic meanings that are actually the interesting bits for me it's just a big no thank you not interested in any of that doesn't make sense to me at all but I've read a translation of the Lord's Prayer for example from the original Aramaic in a poetic mythic way it's amazing beautiful about one it's all about how to stay connected to yourself even though all these difficult things are happening your life not to be resentful not to be angry not to be disconnect not to separate and I as Christianity is the primary religion of the world it's really important that there's an access to Christian mysticism and Christian Gnosticism for people so they can find that wisdom again it's not my particular meeting path because I do think we are in a time where so if the if the 60s were a time where we started becoming really aware of the Eastern traditions for the first time kind of integration of taoism buddhism hinduism if there is another awakening happening now and I think areas and I think what we're seeing is an integration of the the Western traditions at a deeper level Christian mysticism being one of them probably the esoteric tradition and new interest in that because we're actually seeing a lot of things bubbling up through the kind of corners in our culture which is a really interesting time to be and in a way there's a there's a that is a potentially a deeper resin within us with that because they are our lived traditions they're coming from our own culture yes yes I mean if we think about the Western tradition you've got against this dialectic that's flip-flopping between external focus and the internal focus the great one was the Scientific Revolution and the romantics going hold on a minute what about love what about passion and creativity the genius of the individual all that stuff right my hope is that we don't flip-flop again and I think one of the problems we've got in ours of our society is we have this pendulum that goes patriarchy let's go all about the feminists and we just flip-flop between these extremes and there's never goodness in the extremes and my hope is we don't do what we did in the 60s which we gave up the goodness of science and the goodness of material world and entrepreneurship and all these things that really matter here we forget all this I'm gonna be hippy and give it all up and burn my everything which we kinda did again in the rave scene of the 90s and then even the Burning Man countercultural so experience I hope that we can live in this world but bringing the other world into it rather than think we have to go off grid and burn everything to do with the sort of capitalist advanced structures that we're in and I guess in my way of putting that is I'm certainly am NOT countercultural I'm for the culture I'm believing the culture believe because College of Arts or Society I didn't want to fight the man I want to hold the man I don't stick it to him I want to hold him and go it's okay you know you are loved and you look just like I say to my kids every night you are part of this universe your love your wanted you don't buy Qadir I think it's time to let go of all that patterning out protection and allow yourself to feel through the game and feel caring and compassionate again and all the things you want you want this anyway man you know so as soon as we stick it to the man we get back into the worst excesses of new a jury where you're just sitting going well I'm not that and I think the if we can bring these Western traditions back in there are ours you know they're in the land the juries thing you know that whole piece where interestingly the political and spiritual were part of one conversation you know the Druids were the political politicians of their time the Daoists were originally advised us to you know the big guys and they were they they became a folk tradition afterwards actually thousands interesting story because then they because the the politicians sort of rejected them although as a path and they were back into a more externality path they then resorted into what became our chemical Taoism about sex and kind of stuff and I think I really hope we do do it this awakening moment as I hope we don't go well capitalism sucks and politics sucks and liberal liberal democracy sucks so I'm just going to go invest in all this it's a terrorist esoteric stuff and the medicine plants and all this stuff I really believe it's time to own all that it's ours it's our tradition it's part of our tradition and it came from actually from a Christian mindset right this that science and cavil ISM were intrinsically linked to Protestantism and all this sort of stuff but just bring this softer loving juicy dare I say feminine holding within the center of it and that will and I hope that will break down the the the worst excesses of capitalism without attending there's something else that's going to work better so actually I talk about this kind of connected capitalism or compassionate capitalism where we guided by purpose truly going about purpose and that means giving up things so we can bring love into the system you
