[Music] Brett Weinstein and Heather hi Inc became the most high-profile victims of campus activism when they were chased out of evergreen college by a student now it thrust them to national prominence since then they're finding a new role as part of what's being called the intellectual dark web famously you had the instant evergreen which meant you had to leave the campus leave you your post but what's really striking is that you and Heather were teaching evolutionary biology so a lot of the reality of the biological differences between men and women a lot of these subjects that are now really hot topics in the culture within what a lot of people would recognize as one of the most progressive left-wing colleges in the country are there lessons from that that and also when when you were forced to leave Evergreen it wasn't the students that you've been teaching it was students who hadn't been teaching so you obviously doing something right in those in over a decade of being there what lessons how did he do it what lessons can we as a culture learn from that there are tremendous lessons and the key to what Heather and I were doing was that we started out by engineering a community that was safe to have discussions and discussions that were we to take what was said in our classroom and to import it into a faculty meeting would have caused a conflagration for sure but you have a group of students they show up many of them don't even really know why they're there Heather and I were doing this for 15 years and a lot of our students came to us word-of-mouth somebody said oh you have to take this course and evolution people who didn't realize they had any interest in the subject whatsoever would show up and then you lure them in it's a question of broadening their worldview so that they can understand that all of the things that they no they care about all of the things that they find fun to do all of the pursuits that drive them there their loves their passions that all of these things are products of evolution and that means that understanding evolution provides a kind of roadmap against the inner confusion that's a very powerful incentive for people to embrace it so the answer to your question is you provide the safety to explore where people quickly get the idea that they are not going to be backed against the wall for saying something that sounds radical or off we had covenants that actually gave people the right to speak and then retract what they said if it didn't sound right or if they changed their mind or if they came to to see something about their position they hadn't known before which meant that they had the protection of the community just by virtue of playing in good faith so the cultivation of what if the term wasn't so polluted you'd have to call a safe space is the first the first step in creating these difficult conversations and then there's the incentive to have the conversation which comes from the fact that you get something positive for it you know to understand yourself to understand why people interact in the way they do is a very powerful advantage and if you're presented with the question of would you like to endure some discomfort in order to have the power to understand your own life almost everybody will say yes a lot of people are describing the intellectual darkweb as a sort of placeholder for this is what a conversation looks like that there's a lot of different perspectives within it but what people agree on is this is what a genuine conversation in good faith looks like and we've made that a bit of a focus on our Channel what we've called the meta conversation what needs to exist for this meta conversation to take place and what are the forces are acting against it the meta conversation requires a kind of safety and the thing that the IDW has done is it has bootstrapped that kind of safety on topics where people experience in general a profound lack of safety so I think the reason that there has been such a focus on the IDW is that people through the internet can watch others saying things the very nuance of which would cause them to blow up if you said them you know in a speech on a university campus let's say and watching people have those discussions and respond to each other in spite of disagreement and not have catastrophe rein in on them is I think heartening in fact I know that that's the reaction because I hear a lot from individuals who tell me what they see and they are cheering for the the simple demonstration that these conversations are still possible on our channel we've talked a lot about what we call the meta conversation and the intellectual darkweb seems to be an attempt to sort of carve out a space to be able to have conversations about things that are very difficult to have to talk about in the media and I'm really interested as as well your background in evergreen obviously a lot of people know about what happened and you and Brett being forced to leave but what really struck me is that you both were teaching evolutionary biology there for over a decade without creating any of these reactions that we're seeing talking about the reality of sex differences talking about these subjects that often provoked a huge reaction when they're discussed in the media so I'm really interested what that was like how you did it and whether there are any lessons that we can learn more generally about how to have these kind of conversations a technique that both Brett and I used was to open the first day by saying don't trust me don't trust me on the basis of my credentials and my authority or the fact that certainly that the fact that I have the power to assess you and affect your future as a result I have to earn your trust have to earn your respect and hopefully over time I will and you can stop questioning every single thing that comes out of my mouth but to begin with please do please do question that that is actually going to be a sign of respect and we both Brett and I insisted on classrooms that were always respectful and that always understood that people disagreeing with ideas was quite different from proclaiming dislike of the human beings who were voicing those ideas and so you know separating out those two things the human the human the whole human person and the thing that they are saying at the moment even if it's some entrenched firmly held belief still those are two different things and disagreement does not this is not the same as dislike for the person when we talked together this was particularly easy to demonstrate because as a married couple who were presumably not on the verge of divorce which we which we weren't we could disagree with each other and we did and you know even though we were right in the middle of our own material you know we were disagree on topics of sexual selection and you know evolution of parental care and you know under what conditions territoriality involves and these sorts of things that we were we were always teaching on and students could observe how we disagreed what that looked like and also watch us come back in the next one and clearly having you know shared dinner and abend the night before so this sort of model of intellectual disagreement disagreement was particularly easy frankly to do when it was us together in a classroom and I think students very quickly did feel seen and I know that many of them did I hope that nearly all of them did feel to some degree understood you know we insisted on knowing all of their names very quickly and you know by the end of the first week of class I would know everyone's names and at least something some thing about their developmental history which would allow me to start sort of you know building an architecture in my head who is this person it's cool still gonna be a cartoon for quite a while and you know to some degree we it's all I carry around with us you know we have these caricatures that maybe turn to cartoons that maybe become more fleshed out and maybe we get these photorealistic images in our heads of other human beings after we know them for decades but it's never complete and so to just start going down that road to make it clear that you are going down that road with each one of the people in the classroom and not because you think it's your job but because you're actually very interested meant that we didn't we were able to talk about difficult subjects pretty easily right we and you know in some ways it was what students were signing up for you know I didn't the the two kinds of programs that I did most were vertebrate evolution which was not did not fear too much into politically dangerous territory but animal behavior is rife with it you know you can't you can't not go there if you want to do it honestly and so talking about and you know and humans are animals so we didn't we didn't fear from humans and in fact all the seminars that I tend to do in those programs were specifically on humans on human evolution readings what our history has looked like and mostly our prehistory and frankly students especially from historically marginalized and oppressed groups were particularly interested several several people told me nearly every year I taught this material but they were particularly interested to finally get a read on what it was that evolution had to say about about being gay or about different races or about especially in you know in my case I would teach a lot on sex and gender and you know on on what it was to be male versus female and also to specifically be educated and how to assess bad logic because that that was the thing you know that's anyone who's teaching in 2018 or the 21st century in general and is teaching a litany of fact is not doing their students a service you can get that on Coursera or Wikipedia or any mooks you know it's just it's it's all about one line all the facts are there to be found what you want to in the classroom is develop relationship so that you can call people out when they say things that contain by the pneuma logical fallacy or don't allow you to you know you if it's unfalsifiable if you proclaim something that's unfalsifiable you can watch as you know I the faculty or somewhere there's two initiative caught up go well I actually cannot respond to that here's why that means that what you've just proposed me is not a testable hypothesis this we can't do science on it and if you want to take some other way of knowing and try to try to do it with what you've said okay but if we are trying to figure out what is true science is the best tool we've got and we can't do science on the thing you've said what can we do to what you've said to make it falsifiable and then let's work as hard as we can to falsify it and then if we can't the longer we can't the more likely it is that it is true even though we'll never completely know that and why is that freeing it's so freeing it's an it's actually educational and students walk out going okay I am now freed to think for myself whereas I felt sort of roped in by Authority and I think most educators most people who are in educational roles do a better job of demonstrating their own authority than they do have actually freeing students from the yoke of that authority of learning to think for themselves and what do you think of the principles for discussing these kind of topics that you could take from your experience at Evergreen and take out into the world certainly having some sort of a document in advance that everyone has agreed to is incredibly useful you also need someone who's willing to and enabled to enforce it and in the modern authoritarian left landscape enforcers are always seen as bad you know hierarchy is it's a sign of patriarchy and all of this but you you actually can't just have something like the Chicago principles or what was called a covenant in an evergreen classroom which established in advance what the responsibilities are between all the players between students in both directions and what do you do if you have a conflict and you know all of all of the things that you should expect in an honorable community and in the case of a classroom as much as you know it was it was easy to handle the authority it on an everyday basis and say please question anything that I say that you don't agree with but the fact is it wasn't a complete handing authority because I was still faculty at the end of the day and so it was still clearly my you know I was still going to be the arbiter of of disputes that came up so you need that how do you scale that into a non classroom situation where there is no clear even an authority that wants to cede their authority you need someone who can step in and say mmm you're you're going against the rules and you mentioned the Covenant before that is that really important to basically ask people to buy into a set of principles before engaging in the conversation covenants were a feature of Evergreen from its founding so the founders of the college decided that every class should begin with a covenant between professor and student in which the expectations were set out most of the covenants that I saw were uninteresting but it was a place where if you chose to you could do a lot of work and the key utility is that by setting the expectations out as you come through the door while you still have the right to say huh maybe this program isn't for me that means that later on when you invoke this covenant and say well you agreed to this set of rules why are you now saying something else people people recognize that that the obligations they've signed up for are important and I will say one of the things that I started adding to my covenants late in my teaching at Evergreen was that this is not an end user License Agreement and user license agreements are designed so you won't read them so you won't understand what your rights and obligations are the Covenant was the opposite of it was imperative that you read it so that you understood why you were being expected to do X Y & Z along the way and by and large it worked quite well we spent time on these things on the first day of class of people so people got it and then having signed up for it in my experience and Heather's experience people pretty well lived by it and we had communities of good faith interactants that functioned beautifully most of the time and how do we take those lessons out and apply those in the world more generally I mean the intellectual dark web is one attempt at creating this kind of safe space want of a better word but are there are other ways that we can do it well the problem is you will immediately not having such a covenant you will immediately trip over the following problem if you attempt it the Covenant is exclusionary what you are really saying when you set out an agreement about how we will talk and disagree and challenge each other is you are saying that if you don't agree to these rules you're not welcome here now nobody likes to hear you're not welcome here and at the moment that sets people off it's I have a hair-trigger for being told somebody's not welcome there who are you to say who's welcome and appoint as well no I'm not telling you you're not welcome I'm telling you anyone who doesn't agree to this set of good faith principles isn't welcome and as soon as you do agree then you are so you're the one deciding whether you're welcome or not having decided to live by these rules then you get the benefits of what is in effect a much more capable but more fragile conversation and this is I think one of the hardest lessons of well the hardest lessons for me at least of complex systems is that very often the most capable creatures or mechanisms are also the ones with the narrowest requirements so that a beautifully architected creature may have very precise limits on what it can tolerate the beautiful conversation that is capable of traversing some new landscape and doing deftly that conversation does not happen when anybody can law any accusation at any moment with no evidence it happens when people are protected enough to try out difficult things and then to adjust their position and learn where they've arrived so the upshot you have to be able to exclude in order to do the extraordinary doesn't mean that you're excluding people for arbitrary reasons you're excluding them for very simple reasons which is that their presence will destroy the attempt so I think we have to figure out how to intelligently exclude in the interest of accomplishing something for which there is obviously a great hunger and that great hunger implies that there is a deficit and if you were to distill down what say three or four principles of having a generative conversation in good faith are what would they be what conditions allow for that so how do you know you're having one maybe like what are what are the what are the signals that you're actually doing it right but you're actually having a good conversation no wrote apologies apologies for actual wrongs but no wrote apologies do not apologize for things that you did not actually do and if you see sort of a culture of rote apology in a big conversation there's probably fear right underneath the surface similarly I would say look for laughter look for humor look look for and not just you know there's everyone can tell the difference between a nervous laughter and and regular from the gut laughter in which things even when you didn't see something coming or maybe that's often when things get funny when a conversation that was very serious or very technical suddenly erupts and laughter if that can happen there's probably not fear right beneath the surface and and obviously laughter is also a way that people people bond if you know this doesn't happen in every conversation that is that is far-reaching and good faith but obviously if you see people changing their minds or people challenging one another and coming away with any evidence of change perspective that's that's sort of just too obvious I guess I guess those first two that I came up with or maybe maybe two that I remember most fondly from the collapse from both you know these three-hour meandering interactive lectures or labs or even more often you know long meals on field trips where students cooked and then we all ate together and then we might sit around the table for hours afterwards ago and sit around a campfire and having such conversations that ranged from deeply theoretical science to the state of the world to individual stories from people's childhoods about their siblings or their animals or the adventures they've been on interspersed with I mean this is always helpful to someone breaks out a guitar and you know just just like laughing together singing together is a way to bring people together so these are some of the things that can't happen online which is part of I think why we find such an impoverished and quick to anger set of conversations online that we're missing they're just like the actual visceral being in each other's presence and that very quickly allows us to let our guard down you you mentioned this sort of sense of fear under the surface which I think a lot of people would say it's very present at the moment in a lot of conversations did you feel that fear in Evergreen until things erupted it that's an interesting question yes because Brett and I are married and we're faculty there together and we're watching the whole thing unfold we didn't feel fear we like we weren't afraid but there was a definite culture of fear in which people were not speaking what they knew to be true and Brett heard this much more than I did because he was more public with his disagreements with what the administration was doing but after every time that he would stand up in a faculty meeting or send an email to the faculty and staff email list he would have several sometimes very many faculty and staff come to him privately on private channels either in person or over email and say thank you I can't say it because that's a culture of fear and in fact he claimed this he said this six months or so before the Evergreen protests became public and went viral and the response he said this I think over email and the response from some of the faculty who were leading the charge who are leading the authoritarian leftist charge was there's no culture of fear prove it who has come to you well I'm not going to tell you who has come to me because that's exactly how this this would work and you know people will continue to come to me only you know only if I protect them and you know I think one thing that I won't speak for Brett here but one thing that I think I wish that I had done differently was ask people who were coming to us privately to speak up I did on a couple of occasions and there are a lot of reasons not to and I understand them but this could have had a totally different ending and furthermore it could have modeled for everyplace else that this is happening which is to say just about every American campus a lot of workplaces and boy have we heard stories you know we the the college campus ones are easy to report on because they tend to be in these public places with you know poor young indoctrinated students apparently making asses of themselves but it's that's not the real story you know it's I really don't think that there they are the ones who are driving this and what we have you think it's the professor's driving it yeah yeah it's it's the professor's it's the professor's and increasingly the administrators and that's not to say that students don't have agency but very little of these modern protests looks like protests the likes of which I remember I participated in it feels very much more about orthodoxy and about falling into line and about reading from a script' and the fact that I have now seen not just at Evergreen but at two different conferences and a couple of other places as well these attempted power grabs in some places successful like at Evergreen in some places not in which the the authoritarian power grabbers start using all the same words it's it's all on the same script so it's it's not that there is some central clearinghouse where it's coming out of but but it comes from some traditions within unfortunately within the humanities increasingly being taught at schools of Education and therefore spreading very quickly into the k-12 system primary and secondary school and thus frankly indoctrinate and whole hosts of children who are now coming of age and don't have the tools with which to question what it is they're being told so I would say increasingly it will become a problem that the young people themselves are perpetrating on the world but at least until very recently it was being driven by the faculty it was driven being driven by the people who were supposedly the adults who were supposed to know better and who didn't and that's why I would say I wish that I had had the foresight to ask anyone who came to Brett Army privately and you know maybe not to push it but to ask will you please say this publicly and for the most part I didn't for the most part I said thank you it's good to know we're out alone and that's true it's it's very good to know you're not alone when you're facing some you're really stupid and horrifying stuff but it's not enough ultimately what you need is actually not that higher percentage of people to stand up and say I see this and the emperor has no clothes you know like that that's that's what it is you're waiting for that moment and one or two or three people isn't enough yeah a group that that's that is that big when the when the authoritarians on the left are shrieking in language that sounds sort of very superficially like it's anti-racist and anti-sexist and anti homophobic alavesa that's what they say they're doing and some of them in the movement actually I think really do 100% believe that that's what they're doing but in effect they're having exactly the opposite they are having exactly the opposite effect what do you think those the minimum rules are that you would have to sign up to to to have a generative conversation well I know something about what the rules are having played around with different covenants with different classes at Evergreen but I would also say the most interesting thing about the IDW phenomenon is that we don't have a written set of rules what happened is people who separately had arrived at some sort of kit for doing this kind of work found each other because the world had become a place in which conversation had become impossible so if conversation is impossible because saying things that should be say about causes a blowout and then you run into people where you can say those things and no blowout occurs it's natural for you to gravitate so the most fascinating thing to me is that this brought people from so far afield from such different backgrounds of such different political perspective and effectively what unites that to the extent of the IDW is a group what unites that group is the discovery of the toolkit for participating in incredibly difficult discussions and if you were to name those principles what well once you have established that your community in which you're having a discussion is a good faith community in which essentially every person has agreed with the idea that they would rather lose if they have an incorrect argument than win in other words if your priority is getting to what is true and that priority supersedes your own rise then you can do a great deal and what happens at that limit is you can assume that the other people in the conversation are making a kind of sense and to the extent that they sound like they are not making a kind of sense you know where to look you do not resort to the accusation you are being absurd you say I wonder why it is that when I hear through my ears what you have just said does not add up in the slightest so let me try out what I hear you saying and you tell me where I don't have it so that's the steel Manning aspect which is really a a formalization that has caught on of some instinctive process where in order to reach some new place with somebody you have to understand what they're saying not just enough to counter it but you have to understand it well enough to know what really might actually be wrong with it which means you have to also know what's right with it so it is the I mean I think overarching lis it is the question of what role argument plays if argument is a tool to accomplish political ends you can't have these conversations if argument is a tool to discover what's true from which might flow a political desire but it is not the motivating force then you will act very differently as you argue you will argue from a perspective of good faith and you if you're in a position to expect good faith from whoever you're arguing with you have the potential of both arriving at some place better than you start it out you might both learn and that's you know it's win-win and now the image of Evergreen is very poor after what's happened what but I know that you've spoken before about that there was a lot of really good stuff going on there a lot of really inspiring stuff what are the other things that you would like to see as the positive aspect of evergreens teaching style that you think we can all learn from well I've thought a lot about this because it seems to me that evergreens model was half brilliant and half crazy and there was no reason that you couldn't take the crazy part and eliminate it and have improved the model but there was something about treating the founding structure as sacred that prevented the population of evergreen from repairing itself which resulted in the blowing up the key factors that worked were an unparalleled level of pedagogical freedom so professors really had carte blanche to teach what they wanted how they wanted and that meant that people who wish to discover what was possible could could explore and that was coupled with a that was coupled with a classroom structure in which students took one class full-time and professors taught one class full-time and those classes could go on for two or three quarters in some cases what that meant was that you had a tremendous amount of high quality contact with your students so if you were dedicated to the job of teaching in some new way you knew exactly who you were teaching just at the level of every individual in the room was known to you that meant you could track the blind spot that a student had and you could work you could tailor what you were saying and you could try to make sure that it landed on a particular mind in a particular way that would cause some epiphany that needed to happen I don't know of another model in which that's possible that requires the freedom and the high intensity of contact between professors and students and if I was architecting a college in the aftermath of the experience of teaching at Evergreen I would preserve those things above all others what I would do away with is the mechanism for hiring professors and recruiting students both of those mechanisms were badly broken and they meant that the population that arrived at Evergreen was not the right population to take advantage of those structures it was a haphazard mix so the main problem with hiring was that it was done by grouping faculty together and asking them what positions we thought we should hire rather than looking at whose classes were full and saying well if psychology is always full we need some more psychology professors now I'm not an absolutist in this regard I wouldn't say that whatever the population coming to the college wants we should hire as many people as as it can handle but I do think within limits you need a feedback mechanism that tells you what is succeeding which classes are resulting in students walking away feeling like whoa that was definitely worth my time and my tuition money rather than walking away saying what the hell was that and why did I spend 10 weeks on it so had there been a feedback mechanism that caused that which worked to be propagated evergreen would have been a much more effective place evergreen also had an almost complete disconnect between the admissions office and the recruiters and the faculty so we often as faculty had no idea how the college was being advertised and to whom and really Evergreen was largely advertised as a pretty liberal arts college on the Puget Sound when that was the last reason you should go there it was really the place to go if you had very high potential but you needed somebody to treat you as an individual because you weren't perhaps well built for school or you were capable of something extraordinary that was going to require somebody to pay particular attention to your your skills those were reasons to go but they weren't anywhere in the recruiting materials so what we got was a haphazard collection of students Heather and I did very well in this environment because our programs were always oversubscribed and so in a sense although only rarely we'll be in a position to have an application for a program that would allow us to choose the best students for it we were in a position to discourage people who would not benefit from our programs and encourage people who would benefit and when you get a room full of people that are more or less there because either they think they need to hear what you're saying or you think they might benefit from it there's a tremendous amount of potential and Evergreen now has a pretty toxic reputation and it's better to say and but what are the what are the good parts of the Evergreen model that you think we can learn from we should learn from we had time we had academic freedom and with those two things and good faith and you know like I said a classroom effectively has either a benevolent or an envelope monovalent dictator there is an authority figure no matter how much of the authority they want to turn away so in in my case I think I was always a benevolent dictator basically enforcing rules of decency such that we had we'd never prioritized justice over truth but we got both because we did so because we investigated what was true with a sense of of care and compassion and most colleges and universities just don't afford the time so study abroad trips where students will go for a month or two could but for the most part those are these one-off things where the students aren't even from the same University till they show up somewhere far-flung and then they're mostly you know if they're in city is they're in someone's dorms and it's it's it just doesn't really create community the same way so really being able to dive deep with people and reveal truths about yourself not just what you think and how you think but also just about who you are as a person such that everyone in the community is a little bit exposed and once everyone's a little bit exposed and you can see okay we have all trusted each other a little bit here and we are all therefore assuming that there is safety in that I can afford to take intellectual risks and I'm not going to be attacked for doing so and that's that's we were able to do year after year after year so breath said it before but you know I was on sabbatical when the protest happened at Evergreen and not a single one of the students who showed up to protest against him did here I know you know this this wasn't our students who turned against us that didn't happen if that had happened that would be a totally different story and you know I would I would hope that you would be pushing back on my story of you know how effective this was right I give if we have legions of students or any even you know a couple you know find out what their story is find out actually what it is that they're saying that disagrees with what wouldn't Bretton on my claim about what we were doing for 15 years on campus was and I'm sure I know for sure that given that the college that we loved hired a PR firm to basically demonize Brett and then us that they if they could have found such students they would have and we'd be hearing from them but they they haven't so the fact the fact is that people become loyal when they are treated well and if you're only treating people well in order to create loyalty that's not actually being treated well and smart young people can see that and so actually action and smart everyone can see that but I think you're even more able to see that one year when you're young and fresh you've just been no matter how good your school experience was you everyone has had some just awful teachers who clearly disrespected them as individuals didn't really believe in their humanity didn't really think much of them kind of just hoping to be done with it so they could you know would tire whenever they're retiring or don't drink that night or whatever it was and at the point that students show up in a classroom and the faculty says I know you've had awful educational experiences even if even if you're an awesome student and you've had mostly excellent educational experiences I know that you've probably been been taught with a combination of fear and authority and pointless work and I hope to do none of those things and I encourage you to call me out if you think that's what I'm doing that was possible that was possible with time in a way it's not you know we meet for an hour twice a week kind of class [Music]
