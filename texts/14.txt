[Music] so you are in the midst of a very interesting series of lectures called awakening from the meaning crisis yes and something that struck me from the very first one is that you started this series talking about something called flow could you explain a little bit what what is flow and why is it important sure so flow is a phenomena that was made famous by the work of chick Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in two books the book optimal experience and then the follow-up book entitled flow and then he's had books and articles and his students and so forth and so what flow is it's called optimal experience because it's optimal in two senses people regard this as one of the best experiences they can have in their life in fact there seems to be important relations between how often you enter the flow state and how meaningful you find your life right it's optimal in that sense and also people view it as optimal in that they're they're performing at their best they're at their most creative right they're doing sort of the best and their actions two observers seem the most graceful sort of most filled with that you know extra something that we regard as aesthetically excellent right you know when you see an athlete in the flow state there's this act there's this extra dimension of grace and efficacy to their action and then from the inside like if you're doing you're like if you're sparring and as a martial artist or you're playing jazz you you you you you get this I mean this peak place where I'm really at doing the best I can so that that's what it sort of feels like and you can see why people pursue it in fact as I talked about in this series it it's it makes sense of otherwise absurd behavior like like rock climbing because rock climbing like it's it's like some sort of Greek mythological torture you're told to go up a rock face you hurt yourself you might fall and you know damage yourself and then once you get to the top you just come back down and the reason people pursue the rock climbing is well we it's been studied it tends to generate the flow state so that's the the state and it's created by a set of very important conditions it's a state in which there's this very tight relationship with doing the demands on the environment think of the rock climber again and your skills your skills you sort of have to be stretching your skills right to meet the demands of the environment so you have to give it everything and you have to be learning as you're solving your problems you have to be developing even as you're functioning right and and so that needs to be the case there needs to be very clear feedback of information there can't be a lot of ambiguity in this situation like right and then there has to be a tight coupling what I mean by that is my actions and the response of the environment have to be tightly coupled to each other and then finally error has to really matter like you know it has to be it really matters to me it has to so the rock climber can fall right the jazz musician can suddenly screw up and right the martial artist gets hit in the face so error has to matter under those conditions people will get into the flow State one other thing as an important factor the cognitive side of this the kind of training that is predictive of being able to get in the flow state is some kind of mindfulness training great and I want to talk about mindfulness in a moment but I'm curious about what flow has to do when I'm in that state and I'm kind of you know in flow which I think most people have a sense of what that is how does that relate to how I make a meaning or how I experience meaning in the world all right so I mean obviously there's multiple interpretations about this so while there's a consensus of the description there isn't been as much work done on the cognitive processes because that's what you're referring to when you're talking about meaning making that are going on in this so I recently published a chapter in the Oxford Handbook of spontaneous thought with Leo Ferraro and area Hera Bennett and we we we we sort of theorized as to what and we tried to make an argument as to what we think is actually going on so to to give a sort of the gist of it many of us have had an experience of insight like you where and what we realize is oh I've been miss framing this whole thing incorrectly the reason why I can't get a solution is the way I've been framing this problem is incorrect what happens is when you get that aha moment people a couple this ski and Reber and others have talked about it's like a spike in fluency in your processing that's why you get sort of that flash and things are sort of vivid and we often represent it with a light bulb going on over there you get this sort of it's both a flash of intelligibility you suddenly understand and it's also the phenomenological flash the world seems brighter and people actually also enjoy the insight experience right it's now think about what the rock climber is doing right the rock climber is lit it gets into situations if it's a good rock climb if it's challenging if it's demanding right where they get blocked they get locked there it literally in passing and they they reframe and they have to reframe not just how there's think they have to literally restructure their body right to get to the next place and what happens is that insight will prime and make make more likely the next insight they need which will then prime and make more likely the next insight they need the jazz musician does you know some innovation and then that Prime's the next one that is needed there Prime's the next ones that's needed the martial artist does some new unites you know stretches their skills and does its innovation and then that primes and so what you can think of the flow experience like part of it is it's like a cascades of insights there's an aha moment bleeding into in our home ahahahahaha right and it what's different is like normally with an insight problem you sort of stop and you impasse what's happening in flow is it's happening rapidly enough you don't really impasse you almost impasse and then you're constantly restructuring it's like this extended aha moment so that's why in flow people have this tremendous sense of deep understanding the connection discovery and why it's so salient they they talk about everything so vivid and crystal clear and it's and it's so good it's not like physical pleasure like you know like the pleasure of eating chocolate it it's like the cognitive pleasure of the aha moment and insight that's one aspect there's another important aspect a lot of your learning is done implicitly there's experimental work about this it's called implicit learning and of course there's always there's theoretical controversies about how quite to interpret it but the basic idea is you pick up on lots of patterns in the environment that you that you don't have sort of access to in working memory you so you can't sort of introspect and become aware of those patterns that you're picking up so for example many of your viewers I assume know how far to stand away from another person nobody able to explicitly taught you that right and so what's happening in the flow state is you're really training your insight ability and you're really training your intuition intuition generating ability and you're doing this in a highly integrated coordinated manner and that feeds deeply into the machinery by which you are able to solve problems make sense sense intuitive connections in your world around you so that's why it would contribute greatly to how meaningful you find your life so that's very interesting and what really struck me when you're talking about those those three aspects that get us into flow and into this kind of creative mode where it seems easier to solve problems is that they seem the opposite of what we have for example on social media we can't trust our information we have fake news there's not really any consequence for what we say or how we behave and so I'm just wondering what you make of that so I mean my co-author Leo Ferraro talks about one of the dangers of social media he has this term he calls it confirmation porn confirmation pornography because because all of these constraints are removed our cognition has all of these processes that are indispensable to our adaptive intelligence but those self-organizing processes also make us deeply susceptible to two biases now if you put people into things like social media and the kinds of constraints that you have for example I'm getting good flow or the kinds of constraints you need for good reasoning or the kind of constraint you need for good discourse are removed all of those biases can now run unchecked unmonitored unmanaged manner so what leo means by confirmation port one of the most pressing and powerful biases we have is called the confirmation bias we tend to only look for evidence that confirms our beliefs now in small-scale situations where people are in you know tightly coupled to their environment and actually acting as checks and balances on each other that's very effective but you take that confirmation bias and put it into social media you get the echo-chamber right and you get this confirmation porn where all people are doing is using social media in a autodidactic fashion to confirm whatever beliefs they already have so that's what I think is going on the next thing I wanted to talk about and I'll go into it with a with the famous quote from Timothy Leary of turn on tune in drop out so obviously psychedelics you know hit the culture pretty in a pretty significant way in the 1960s are now going through a massive revival that you've talked about them in your films are psychedelics a psycho technology so I wouldn't I mean there's a bit there's a there's a possible equivocation and we could be talking about the chemical thing or we can be talking about the experience surrounding it and and then I would say we can create frameworks of psycho technologies around the experience such that we can write structure that experience to engender the kinds of transformations that are conducive to the cultivation of wisdom so I think to put it in a sentence we can create sappy ntral frameworks of psycho technologies around psychedelic experiences that will afford the kind of transformation people are seeing so let me give you what I think is a hopeful analogy many of people are aware that part of what's driving this the psychedelic Renaissance at least academically scientifically there's a lot of evidence about the efficacy of psychedelic experience in like alleviating treatment resistant depression or addiction or helping people to confront existential despair people who are in terminal situations as palliative means for them to get an existential mode to face their imminent death so people are aware of that what people need to be aware up let's give one really clear example the use of psychedelics we're dealing with sort of like post-traumatic stress disorder or treatment-resistant depression it's always the psychedelics in conjunction with therapy the scientific work is always a conjunction simply taking the drug on its own it will not you see what you're doing is you're your we'll talk about this we can talk about some of the underlying neurological and cognitive processes in a minute if you wish but basically what you're doing is you're you're loosening up the constraints on your control of this situation and you're altering your salience landscape now that can right that can be that can sort of activate processes of self-organization that lead to self transcendence but it can also activate processes of self-organization that lead to deep self defense see sorry deep self-deception you could massively  yourself with these things - very much like being in the echo chamber inside you know social media so you need to set up the proper Sapienza framework so that those processes right are being like the the kind of self-organization that's being triggered is the self-transcending kind of self-organization not self-deceiving kind of self-organization so the psycho technologies that we set up around these psychedelics which of course is what's happening in therapy because therapy is a prototypical set of psycho technologies for trying to change people's consciousness and cognition you you want to set those up and if you look into the spiritual traditions that's always the case these psychedelics are not used you know in entertainment situations or recreational situations or on a daily basis they're used within a sacred context that is really designed to frame them so to bring about the kind of sappy an shal transformation I was talking about yes no I've experienced that firsthand I've seen as many people more confused to their psychedelic use then then less confused and it strikes me you know you talk the law about the impact of ancient Greece on our worldview now and of course they had the Eleusinian mysteries which was kind of a big psycho drama that you know that was probably as powerful as what they took if they took anything and I'm just wondering aside from the therapy side of things I mean do you see people taking psychedelics in a way that is conducive to that have you seen any evidence of that and you think still more needs to be done I do see evidence of that I mean there is lots of people that are doing it recreational entertainment just as sort of a cognitive booster or enhancer or something like that but I know of like person-to-person and more of the literature I've spoken at conferences where I've talked about this and got a lot of response so I don't have scientific evidence on this there are some people that are trying to gather that but I have a lot of at least suggested anecdotal evidence that many people are trying to integral integrate the pursuit of sort of I don't know of rejuvenating a sense of sacredness in their life with sets of psycho technologies wrapped around the psychedelic experiences and do you think are you optimistic that this current revolution in psychedelics could could help us wake up more effectively from the meaning crisis and get us into a to kind of a new mode of thinking yeah I I am more optimistic precisely because the way it's not being academically framed it's not being framed in the Timothy Leary countercultural thing at least not in that sense it's being a lot of it's being framed therapeutically existentially and even as I've said you know Sapienza lis spiritually trying to get this together the problem we face with that and this is how the meaning crisis interacts with this right is we don't we don't have established wisdom traditions and institutions in the West anymore we've lost them so we know that we know where to go for for knowledge and information we go to history and science for knowledge we go to the internet for information and the media but where to go for wisdom so what happens is right people tend to pursue this in a autodidactic manner that they try to cobble things together and the the the the danger with that is autodidact ism is also a venue in which you can really fall prey to bullshitting yourself and self-deception I mean a lot of famous autodidact turned out to be really really horrible people for exactly that reason so because we do not have vetted safe networks of things like sort of I don't know what like secular monasteries or something where people can go where there are traditions and in evolving traditions I don't mean stagnant evolving traditions and compete in communities well that it practiced scientifically studied sets of psycho technologies integrated systematically together people don't have that that's what because of the meaning crisis that means they there is this great danger of the attempt to Wed the sacredness with the psychedelic experience is falling prey to a lot of autodidactic for lack of a better word corruption and so I would hope that all of the things that I see moving towards addressing the meaning crisis would and as we're starting with David not just theoretically but practically engineering communities and institutions and sets of psycho technologies properly vetted and managed with you know appropriate connections to the scientific world right but that we would be able as we're doing this alleviation of the meeting crisis we that need to create the psycho technologies will integrate with movements that are occurring because there are these movements I'm going to be talking to a personal podcast next week who's set up some secular monasteries there's attempts to try and capture what the Scandinavian countries did with you know with the movement of creating the self cultivation and centers and so there's there's there's things happening I'm hoping these two things will join so that we will get places so I think it's mark Hayden who talks about the idea we should create certification programs for psychedelics like we do for any other potentially dangerous things like driving a car and you should have to there should be established institutions educational facilities places where you can go and train receive critical and informative feedback and then use the psychedelics within that context I'm hoping we can build towards that I guess one of the big questions in science versus spirituality but when I call it that because I understand a part of your work is to kind of bridge and it relates actually as well to psychedelics in some way I helped organize a big conference called breakin convention psychedelics conference and one of the main tensions there is between people who have these peak experiences and their deep feeling is that they have tapped into a wider consciousness that is beyond them a kind of consciousness that is everywhere and then there's more materialist people who say no this is all just being generated in your brain so that seems to be a big crux point and I've heard it described as the hard and soft problem of consciousness you know what what is consciousness so be interesting just to hear your thoughts on can that be reconciled does it need to be for for this kind of blending I mean consciousness is really hard I I do it I am doing work on it you know working being with answers and Tana Richard whoo and you know and what what I want to say is I think I would argue that one of the important things consciousness is doing why we seem to need consciousness for ill-defined novel problems right challenging problems in that way is because consciousness is doing this kind of higher order relevance realization and part of what consciousness does is give me this perspective on knowing of a salience landscape that makes all this meaning making possible and that's why altered states of consciousness it can also reveal aspects of the environment that are not normally revealed like if you look at one one quick digression this actually goes back to the drug issue in some ways my friend and colleague brilliant man Mark Lewis says you know when we're talking about drug addiction don't focus on the on the drug the material thing and a like a disease model but the drug enters you he says instead what you should think about is you you you you the drug triggers a state which sort of lowers that process of Co identification a little bit of your cognitive flexibility goes away so the options available to you in the world narrow a bit now because they narrow that tends to like traumatize your cognition and it starts to become more rigid it narrows and you see what happens here you get this cycle this vicious feedback loop and he calls it reciprocal narrowing and when I was talking to mark about this I said well that reciprocal narrowing could go the other way a reciprocal realization like in when Plato talks about this and coming out of the cave and all of that and he said oh yeah you're right that that makes sense right and so I think we have to understand something understand a way of bridging this by understanding that that dynamic connectivity is what we are actually wanting to talk about here's how I would put this we should stop thinking of these experiences as are they're a subjective property of our cognition or an objective property of the physical world these are trans Jack t'v properties about our connectedness and these are real relations notice the adjective these are real relations that afford reciprocal narrowing if if we're doing it wrong or afford reciprocal realization and I think what's happening it because I do a lot of work on these higher states of consciousness is people are actually wanting to describe reciprocal realization they feel like they're getting to the depths of themselves and the depths of reality at the same time and they are right I agree with them that the standard grammar of subjectivity and objectivity cannot capture that trans gentleman's realization if we think about these processes and we think about the real relations the dynamical systems we can craft a language that will bridge between you know the hardline Objectivist and the hardline subjectivist about this so that's how I will respond I think there is an important way in which we can create a new vocabulary about transductive 'ti dynamical copenhague reciprocal reciprocal realization that will be and I try to do this in some of my talks on higher states of consciousness I have some on YouTube on exactly this and I'll talk about it in the video series as well that do just as both to the phenomenology and the sense of importance and depth that people are feeling and to the scientific worldview that you know the what you call the materialists are holding on to I think it does justice to both this leads quite nicely into what I wanted to talk about next which is mindfulness because we actually both share we both have a practice but we also train people as well one of the phrases I love in mindfulness is don't believe everything you think and so it seems that mindfulness is can very much be a tool for helping us wake up from these biases and maybe I guess waking up from the meaning crisis in general so I'd love to hear hear your thoughts on that right so what I would say is mindfulness are does what we need to reformulate how I think we're thinking about mindfulness and think of it instead of as single practice as an ecology of practices and I would also say we need to integrate mindfulness with other complementary cyclic technologies like barren and Stanovich his idea of active open mindedness and I think getting sets of psycho technologies that complement each other in terms of their strengths and weaknesses is is what we should actually be pursuing let's talk about mindfulness first though and then if you if you give me a chance I'll come back and talk about active open mindedness so the thing about this and this is work I did with Leo Ferraro published in 2016 the thing about this is you have to be careful when we're entering into this discourse because there's two different discourses we could have about mindfulness there's the there's the language we use in a setting in which we're training mindfulness and I can use all kind of lang in that setting that's appropriate to actually training this skill for you right and this is analogous that I can train your memory by doing what Sherlock does right the the the the mental palace right the method of loci and and that really trains memory very well the problem with the method of loci is it gives you the idea that that's how memories work that they're located and stored as stable objects in stable location and memory doesn't work like that at all like there's just that spatial metaphor for memory is just completely misleading so the language of training is very effective but you should not translate it uncritically into the language of explaining right and so a lot of the language of print training that we're using in at least in the West is you know pay attention to the present moment focus on the here and now right sort of concentrate and that's like I said that's language I used to but I think if we're trying to explain what mindfulness is that's I think that that's not a not good enough it's it's got to impoverish the view of attention and it doesn't really tell us what people are doing cognitively because terms like here and now are irredeemably vague what is here this couch this room Toronto what's now this moment this hour this day we've tended to think of mindfulness just as equated to being present a state of being present that's achieved in meditation I would argue that that's an unfair representation of the ecology of practices for example found within Buddhism because for example you have a whole set of psycho technologies in the Eightfold Path and you have things like right mindfulness and right concentration which tells you that there are wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration and what do I mean by that in meditation you're doing this stepping back and looking at your breaking any inappropriate framings you have right and that could help afford insight but you need another thing to to actually really optimize for insight you need our me not to break an inappropriate afraid you need how you need how you need to know how to make a new and more penetrative deeper frame that picks up on those real patterns in reality and that's what I would argue contemplative practices and the word you're the words yourself themselves point to it meditation is like moving towards the center and so when we talk about finding your Center a lot in meditation contemplation the word contemplation is the word temple in it that you know temple is where you looked in the sky originally you look deep into the depths of reality contemplate AO is the Latin for the Greek theoria which will we get the word theory from because the theory originally means to look try to look and see the deeper patterns in reality and so what you have in Buddhism is you have meditative practices like for pasta to help you break inappropriate framing and you have contemplative practices like meta that help you make new appropriate framing and that and having them dynamically trained together really optimizes and affords your insight and your capacities for insight we know this from work done at the University of Toronto by Colin to young Joe Flanders in and Jordan Peterson and they sort of acknowledged it was inspired by me so that that capacity for insight is also directly related to your capacity for picking up on self-deception right so it has to do with sort of a particular experimental methodology so I won't get into that so mindfulness really enhances your insight but one more thing before I turn to another topic the level at which like what I'm doing Metta right I'm trying to pick up on and I'm contemplating right I'm trying to pick up on the process of Co identification I'm trying to become aware of something that's normally higher up happening intuitively and automatically I'm trying to become aware of the identities I'm assuming and the identities deciding right now I'm a scientist and you are an interviewer right in this room which is normally my partner's living room is you know it's an arena for an interview like i dint objects are being assigned identities I'm that process of Co identification is happening all the time and I want to bring that into my awareness month by my contemplative practices I want to see those patterns so what I can do I can develop this capacity for insight by doing contemplation and meditation and then I can take it not just a level of intellectual insight but down to a modal level the existential level the levels by which we are creating these patterns of identities for ourselves and on others in the world and I can get insight at that level by which identities are being formed and that is that's what I think the vast sana which means insight is in the past not like insight at that level of the process of identity formation and so that's it's not just insight into your sort of daily life which mindfulness will give you more creative write help you make better sense reduce your self-deception but it can also take you down to this very deep fundamental level at which we're making the relationships between the agency and the arena of things so that all of our actions are meaningful to us so I think that's what how mindfulness can really address that but like I say and though and there's increasing evidence that mindfulness helps to reduce certain kinds of biasing I think that whole set of psycho technologies that ecology needs to be integrated with other sets of psycho technologies like active open mindedness for example fantastic John rebecky thank you so much thank you so much I really enjoyed this a lot [Music] you
