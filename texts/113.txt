that's when things start to line up yeah and the more you're in that space the more they line up and so the question is if you're like really in that space how much do things line up I've had experiences where everything came together you know and and and there are very very powerful experiences and and they're they're also characterized by it's like everything turns into a musical symphony where each part is exactly appropriate for that moment and and I think music actually expresses that which is partly why music produces transcendent experiences you know I think it is an intimation of Paradise it's something like that and you can think about that psychologically you know because it also makes sense psychologically that your optimal experiences are going to occur when you're most United with yourself and but I don't know what see we don't exactly understand the relationship between our consciousness and the world we're at our best when we're integrated completely and there is an effect of that integration in principle on what we would normally regard as external reality because external reality can line up with that integration as well and so-called external reality you know I also think that figures like the Buddha you know he's an exemplar of the possibilities of that alignment and the exercise is the yogic exercises for example our attempts to bring that alignment into being you know I mean it's very centred on the body which is quite interesting even though it's a spiritual tradition right it's very very centered on the body and I think people probably experience that when they have peak sexual experiences with someone you know where there's real intimacy because they're in the same place at the same time and everything comes together for that moment you know maybe literally yes yes literally right and and and I also don't think that that linguistic usage is chance right because I think that's a place where that experience is a brief intimation of of heaven that might be a way of thinking about it
