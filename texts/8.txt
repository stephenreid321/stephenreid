[Music] we're in the middle of the second psychedelic revolution fueled by books like Michael Pollan's how to change your mind interest in the drugs is spiking for them to be truly accepted into the culture many are hoping that medical trials will show they work as medicines so it's a significant moment as a new film comes out showing the inside of one of the biggest studies so far in the UK using psilocybin the active ingredient in magic mushrooms to treat depression [Music] he was taken back to very very difficult memory people go through their whole lives without ever really facing those demons this was the big ride this is the one that changed things and it found a very mixed fascinating story I was so surprised I mean in the first leg of the Electra or medical psychedelic trial in the UK and they they want to let cameras in and we said to him look you know I think it's brilliant that you want us to do this but we're not gonna make a film where we are compromised in any way so we need to have access to all areas we need to be able to ask whatever we want to ask we need to just produce the film that we see that it's presented to us the film magic medicine follows three participants all with serious treatment-resistant depression through a high dose psychedelic experience on the morning of the session when people are having the capsules especially on the high dose essence it's a very strong dose of psilocybin just this feeling of you have no idea where they're going to go you have no control and and it's just this big act of surrender and Trust and for someone who is maybe just coming to the subject completely fresh they've just seen this film is saying they took people with depression and gave them magic mushrooms and just think that doesn't even make any sense why would you do that what's what's behind it ya know III really felt that the other day we were making a poster for our new study we're doing another psilocybin for depression study and we were making a poster for recruitment and it just you know it was like have you suffer friend are you interested in taking a magic mush I mean it just felt like that you know kind of a crazy thing to be asking people to do and that's how having worked in it for years and years I can still see that it's kind of how people see that it makes it actually makes a lot of sense because well that the work at Imperial is his work using brain imaging so we have an understanding now also Robin cohort Harris and David Nutt who are there and they've led this research program they're neuroscientists and they have through sustained work going deeper and deeper into the neuroscience of it they have they have realized that actually psychedelics they deactivate that what's called the default mode network so they have this this this effect of kind of introducing some flexibility into the brain so where things have become very rigid and very set in their way so people get stuck in very negative thinking patterns ruminating and magic mushrooms and other psychedelics to have this effect of introducing a state of intense flexibility for that while the session is going on and then the brain seems to kind of reset itself of 20 seriously depressed patients in the study the treatment didn't work at all for three another three are now depression free the other 14 had a window of between six weeks and six months where they were no longer depressed I kind of feel like the film ends where they are now and so if I've been filming for another year I didn't think it that made a difference I think the film kind of ends as to where these guys are now they are not in a good place they just are you know in the film and Rebecca John's daughter from the Scottish farmer you know she was saying better to have seen dad you know for a brief moment again then not to have seen it at all he thought it was fixed he was four he came out and he said I am six I and he was four you know probably four weeks completely and then eight weeks kind of and then 16 weeks little lessons on him and now he's back so back to where he was maybe maybe even worse I don't know so I'm glad it showed that very mixed picture because it's an important message especially in these times of so much enthusiasm in the circles of people that have know about psychedelics it's still a very small little niche but for people in that that world although they've experienced it themselves and had a profound benefit there's so much hope so what does the story tell us about the potential for this therapy why does it work and how could it work better the other thing is that it really is a process it really is the beginning of a journey so it's a very powerful entry into a journey it's a very strong beginning and it can achieve in one session what normal thirty might take a long time to achieve it's very experiential it's very real but it's the start of a journey it's not the end of the journey so there's all units like peeling an onion there's more layers and there's more layers and more layers so and the idea that I mean some people have had these kind of mystical experiences where they they have an experience where they feel they suddenly see themselves in the world in such a different way that that kind of changes everything they don't fear death anymore and the way they see other people is different that does happen but from what we saw in the last study most people have suffered from depression again now and and they have really really wanted for the psychedelic work that is the work that they would have wanted is there a tension between because a lot of time with with the medical model the idea is you take a pill and it has this effect on you like it's a very kind of material idea or a very mechanistic assumption it feels that there's something very different going on with psychedelics do you think there's a there's a weird tension I think it's a very good tension because I think the tension that is there has the power to really transforms our system of care I think what psychedelics bring about is this absolute paradigm shift in the you can't use psychedelics in that way psychedelics will never be able to safely be put into a kind of conveyor belt system of care they will radically transform any system of care they're brought into because in order to do them safely you need all the things I think are important for therapeutic changes to happen so you absolutely cannot give a psychedelic substance to someone without proper trust and that means proper trust that they have for themselves for the therapists for Silla psilocybin substance like proper proper trust and that doesn't get developed overnight you have to you know you have to spend the time getting to know someone before that can develop there's also this importance of being very real and in the relationship with with the person because you are about to embark on this journey together you are both going to be there in that room with them having these capsules of psilocybin and they could go anywhere they could go back to a traumatic experience in their life that is they feel they're going through again they could be crying in pain they could be facing something absolutely petrifying terrifying but they don't understand I know what it is but feel that they're being pulled apart they could die they could feel it not literally dying they could feel they're having what it's like an ego death experience and feel that they're dying or exploding or you know it can be very very intense and they can have sweet blissful experiences of oneness and connection to all things but you just don't know where they're going to go but you have to be with them when you're it's kind of like a roller coaster and you have to be there on the seat next to them wherever they go so there's just no space for some kind of slightly disengaged half their relationship that you might have in normal psychology services because you see people for an hour every hour this is a full day together and you get to a very real place and you get to know each other as people human beings it's not doctor patient or therapist patient at all it's two human beings doing something very human and profound together as you sort of just said then a lot of the the psychedelics can give an insight but often that insight will be something you need to work on it won't be kind of connection to everything and then suddenly feeling like much more whole can be while I never realized that I had this pattern or I had this pattern we behave like this and then it's up to you to do the work to make yourself well which is which is very different to the kind of classical medical model yes it's a very much an active process not something that just happens to you I mean the fact that the experience itself can be quite grueling is is really this will be the start of that process it's not something to be done like me it's it's all about willingness willingness to surrender to open up to to feel things and yeah I mean it's not just that the day itself which can be kind of like a really hard slog exhausting you know six or seven hours of different emotional experiences exhausting for people and they can cry more than have cried in the whole lives they can feel even the ecstatic states can be quite physically tiring but then yeah after that there is this people often describe for a few weeks after or maybe even a bit longer this sense of spaciousness and openness afterwards that having been stuck in very fixed patterns of elimination they suddenly feel like the lights were turned on or they feel a bit freer and there's more clarity and there's this we think it's a kind of window of opportunity in terms of brain flexibility there's things are more flexible for a certain amount of time afterwards and then it might get harder to change habits because things get more set in stone again but there is this window flexibility where if people want to change their behaviour in that time that is really the key time for a therapy to maximize that that's possibility but if people are on their own you know people have the experience and then in our study people have the experience then they go back to communities that don't know anything about it necessarily or doctors that don't know anything about it and family members that aren't really sure about how it works and they might have ideas about what they want to change but I think people in future as we optimize these treatments people will benefit from having much more much more therapeutic support in those first weeks to really help people determine okay what's going to be different now I've seen this I felt this what am I actually going to do tomorrow to start changing the patterns sitting as a therapist and one of these sessions is a bit like you're witnessing somebody choreograph their own very very unique therapy session they go in ways that you could never have predicted or even design yourself because they're so subtle so you go into the session you don't know what's wrong really you understand that someone suffering from depression but you don't really know why or how and they will go through a sequence of visions or lessons or they'll go from here to here and then it'll change and it'll shift into something else and at the end of the day when they're talking through their experience you're left with this profound sense of respect for the process that that person's unconscious mind was somehow able to take them on this journey back towards some kind of health or a journey with a step in the direction of balance and health so that's it's so exciting to me the idea that we hold within artists potential for rebalancing that it's not coming from a therapist the therapist in psilocybin therapy do very little really it's more providing the safety in the space and some of the experience of what kind of things can come up so people can feel trust view but essentially it's all about the person themselves and what's happening within them and that is the most exciting thing because that is what gives me hope that I mean how could a manual that's been written or helped everybody how could some very kind of like kind of rigid template ever be right for everybody we're all world within ourselves we're all unique universes so it something that allows those universes to inside each of us to come in balance I think we could see a massive change in how effective treatments are because they haven't worked that well up to now I mean it's like talking therapies announcer depressants worked for like half 50% of people it's a lot of people that aren't helped by them this could really change our healthcare systems and is there one particular thing that you think people maybe on the outside of psychedelic this this subject maybe don't understand but should understand I think that they're they're nonspecific amplifiers so what that means is that they aren't inherently good or inherently bad and some people often people describe it after a psychedelic experience they feel more connected to themselves and other people in around them and they feel much more concerned about protecting nature and actually they might feel a little bit more concerned I mean after near-death experiences people come away from them and off and feel that they're much more they've changed their life and they want to do things for other people rather than worrying about material things it can be that same kind of thing a sudden awakening of what's really important however there's a romanticized view that giving psychedelics to people would make everything better there have been people in the past they've used them and have become the kind of Messiah Complex has got stronger and stronger and they can become much more narcissistic lots of people that use psychedelics regularly have become much more narcissistic through that practice rather than less so they definitely don't strip away the ego for everyone so they're not necessarily good but that you know they're not necessarily bad I mean a lot of people have the view that psychedelics will make them go crazy and you know and that's absolutely not true either somewhere in the middle at this for each person it's a unique it's a unique experience for each person of opening up to something of going deeper into the self going deeper than the kind of standard and Martin ensel chatter and going deeper down and what lies there will be different for for each person [Music] you [Music]
