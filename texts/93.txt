my name is David fuller and a journalist and I've recently started teaching men's work and this is a bit of a story about how I got into men's work what I got out of it and it's about masculinity it's about my relationship with my father it's a very personal story but I hope that it's also in some way Universal I've told it to people in the past it's sort of yeah it seems to connect with something quite deep in the experience of having a father and maybe not getting on so well with your father and then trying to rebuild that light that that relationship in in the later years of your life so we're going to pull back and start this story back in 2011 in Libya I used to be a foreign producer with channel 4 news Tripoli was falling Gaddafi was on the run we came into Tripoli just as Gaddafi's regime was crumbling this is centre of Tripoli just as everything's going completely mental so yeah then so shortly after that we got to get out Gaddafi's tent this is the burnt out Gaddafi's tent in the center of Tripoli and around us all of these guns are going off people firing into the air it's just this incredible moment there's a few times in my journalistic career or I felt I'm in the middle of history this is just an extraordinary place an extraordinary experience and we had a satellite phone I thought I really want to share this so I called my parents called my mom and she answered the phone and I said listen listen to this just crazy crazy moment guns going off everywhere and she started crying and I said okay I'm not in danger and she then said I'm at the hospital with your dad he's just been diagnosed with stomach cancer and we don't know much but we know that stomach cancer is is a diagnosis of stomach cancer usually means it's pretty advanced and we think it's pretty bad and he he was young he was fit he'd just been on cycling holiday the literally just the week before and so it's completely unexpected completely out of the blue and I knew it wasn't good I started crying as well on the phone and my bosses at Channel 4 News thankfully just put me on a plane straight back to to the UK and so as we're in the plane going back to the UK I'm just going to take a little digression and fill in the gaps because growing up I didn't get on well with my father at all we always fought and we still didn't get on even in 2011 just before this happened and I to be honest I was I was a bit of a little shit to him growing up I used to kind of take the piss out of him I used to there was a sort of conspiracy with my mother against him and I was I I never worked this out worked out why for a long time but I was really nasty to him I push him I'm pushing my pushing and I I remember one time I pushed him so much that he grabbed me by my throat and held me up against the wall and it didn't it didn't sort of dawn on me until later and there was kind of a real sense of euphoria when I got when that happened as well it never dawned on me until later why that had happened it took me quite a long time to work it out and a lot of it was through the kind of the men's work and the inner work that I'd done after that that I sort of started to make sense of it so my parents were very left-wing very idealistic my childhood was like CMD marchers delivering leaflets for the Labour Party they were very rebellious as well and naturism now for about the next couple of minutes I'm gonna be speaking with a picture of my naked father behind me but it's what he would have wanted so my father was very much a kind of new man he wanted to be very different from the male role models that he had and he wanted to kind of yeah be non-competitive and be be someone different from from his father and what he'd seen growing up very non-competitive mber when we were played when we played football me and my brother he'd say why do you have to have a goal I couldn't just pass it to each other and it took me a while but underneath he was he was really opinionated he was really stubborn he always thought he was right very different from me everybody knows he lies and he could also get really really angry and want his own way and I think that's what I was doing when I pushed him just sort of pushing that point like to say I know that that's not that that's not authentic that kind of non competitive age there's something more there and I pushed him until he until he snapped until I found it and my mum told me later on that just that moment really traumatized him like him really it took him a long time to get over that that that I pushed him to that point that he grabbed me and that he realized that he had that in him and it took it took a lot a lot of sort of transformational work after that where I started to really unpack the the anger that I had towards my father and to really kind of understand it and and recognize that all the things that I disliked in him I I had it I had all of those things in myself and was really able to kind of understand the shadow of what what I was pushing out in him was something that I also had because my my experience of men's work is that I can speak to myself as a man I have those those edges I have that aggression I have that wanting to be right I have that wanting to dominate I have all of these things that can come out and my experience is it's only through fully recognizing those and integrating them that I've become more hold as a man to to do what you could call the shadow work of really kind of looking at myself really deeply and then taking that anger taking that aggression and using it integrating it into the personality and then becoming sort of more more present more powerful it becomes I think once integrated a form of sort of personal power and becomes a kind of fuel for certainly it's become a kind of fuel for my life and over probably since about 2006 when I first started doing workshops and starting doing this work this sort of in a work from a place of crisis in myself that I started to really kind of integrate some of these things and on some level I started to heal at least some of the relationship with him in my self although at this point we haven't kind of healed it in the in the outside world so planes now about to land in in the UK and I go straight down to Southampton to see my dad in the hospital and he's outside in the garden with my mom and a family friend and I just go up to him and I embrace him and for my friend after a few minutes my friend takes this picture which is one of the most precious things I have in my life I think how probably lasted for about 10 minutes it might have been even more sort of time stopped and my friend realized at some point that he was in the presence of something special and got his phone out and took this picture and something something I think very profound happened in that moment some kind of healing happened and I've had a few friends who've looked at this friend of mine touched it up and has turned it into a picture I have my wall at home and there's something about the way he's kind of collapsing into me and I'm holding him that's a kind of a transfer of some kind of I don't know as a child taking something and taking it from my father that that from what then happened I feel that that's what happened in that moment and I think what happened here catalyzed a lot of what happened next because shortly after that he got the diagnosis and he was diagnosed with three months to live and that makes makes things real obviously and I I then wrote him a letter and I said I said look I've been doing all of this work I've done all these workshops and I get these reflections from people in these workshops where people say they talk about my authenticity or they talk about my honesty or and I realize these are your qualities I realized that I got them from you and I've never been able to admit that to you I've never been able to to recognize all the good that I got from you and he was very touched by that letter and then I thought well this is he's gonna be dead in three months why doesn't everyone I don't want to hear his funeral stuff that people should have said to him before so I'll ain't got in touch with all of his friends all of the family everyone that used to work with as many people as I could and said he's gonna be dead in three months I want to hit I want you to what you might want to say at the funeral wanted to say it now and send it to him and so over the next three months as he was becoming more and more ill lying in bed my mum was reading these to him and all of this amazing stuff started coming in from former friends work colleagues family so he was an arts officer for the council and created the Southampton Film Fest of all save the Theatre Royal in Winchester created the street parties in the road and my father's like core wound was that he really didn't think he'd achieve very much in his life he he had a real down on himself and felt that he'd been a failure he'd never read amounted to much and this this had really eaten away at him and then somehow in the last three months of his life some of that change some of that shifted just from the weight of all this stuff coming in and the sheer love an outpouring of stuff that came in and I'm sure that part of that was catalyzed by that one moment and that one healing that I was able to do and then to be there for him and then to produce I turned him yeah I'm sure it's catalyzed by this by this moment and then I I made a I took all of those and made it into a book that I gave to him for his for his birthday sort of about three weeks before he died because there was also when when things like this happen there's there's a Jordan Peterson quote where he talks about be the person to rely on in a funeral it's hard enough in a funeral but it can be absolute hell if you haven't dealt with your family stuff and I really feel because all sorts of stuff came in some people are in denial some people are in don't want to know I mean other members of my family just wanted it to go away they weren't ready for I feel that I I was able to be there because of the work that I'd done and yeah it turned into a really beautiful experience rather than being absolute hell even though we were all there when he died we we were holding hands around his bed when he died and it was it was very yeah it was it was one of the most I now look back on it it's one of the most precious moments of my life and it's a it's a wonderful it's a it's a wonderful story and it's often I told this sort of over the last few years and this is normally where it ends and it's but it's not where it ends because as someone who had I believed my father's image of himself like I I treated a Miss this failure growing up I'd realized that I didn't turn alized the story that he hadn't treated him the same way to kind of treated himself and then to have all of this come on at the age of 36 to realize by the time he was my age he'd opened an Arts Centre he saved a theater he'd created the South Hampton Film Festival he'd had three kids it's like oh this guy I thought was a failure at a chief farm or that that stays that I had and there's also something that in my experience when your father goes as a man that's there's something archetypal even though I didn't get on that well my father there's something there that's missing this sort of archetypal grounding point and I really found that I had to go on a journey of myself over the next sort of six months to really find my path and find what I needed to do and it was it then became like the hardest period of my life like I've had some real ups and downs over the last six years just really trying to get my shit together and decide what it was that was meant to be doing with my life and what I was meant to be bringing into the world yeah it was pretty hard and yeah it's only in the last year I feel that I've really started to come out of that and realize what it is that I'm supposed to be doing and it's sort of its leading men's work use my journalistic skills to tell the stories of this kind of transformational work and then to lead the work because you can only you can't you can't show someone a film and give them a transformational experience you've got to give the transformational experience as well and this is the work that I'm most passionate about and this is what I found the most helpful in my in my personal journey and we consciously in our workshops we consciously bring in support of the father it's a very kind of emotional piece for a lot of men to to feel that to model some some healthy father energy in that workshop space and we had a guy a father and our last workshop who said he he really wanted to go away and give that to his son so I you know as always writing this yesterday kind of I wish that my father had had some of this and maybe the relationship that I have with him would have been a bit different but he did the best he could and I'm really grateful for that and I just want to yeah honor him by raising a toast to Michael - Michael [Applause]
