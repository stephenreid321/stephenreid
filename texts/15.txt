[Music] for better or worse I think I can probably safely say on one of the most high-profile academic couples who are willing to talk about and explore the issues around polyamory what do you make of the fact that you're now kind of the poster academics for this subject but there are nearly enough yeah one thing you realize if if you get into debates about polyamory versus monogamy you know it it was said by a lot of folks in the hall right politics is downstream of culture but culture also apparently is down the stream of the mating system so if you really want to get people riled up you challenge the mating system that actually dominates you know relations between the sexes but also family structure and has knock-on effects on everything from kind of the design of housing and urban spaces to the design of careers and the extent to which people can kind of use freedom of association to form little families or poly tools or communes or whatever and as soon as you kind of shake the tree of monogamy and challenge that people panic and they think like what else might have to change if this is ever questioned we actually don't really pay that much attention to other polyamorous people because we think that a lot of what other polyamorous people endorse is actively not to be yeah Leslie puts you find a point on it but yeah we I mean I always like to say that we don't endorse it we just talk about how it can work for some people and about how it is potentially a you know a better way to have a fuller life for people who can manage jealousy and who you know I think I actually don't understand how people do polyamory without an evolutionary perspective for example and that is something that we're planning on exploring more and writing videos yeah yeah like we don't really hang out in the polyamory Facebook groups or go to poly meetups or go to the conferences or whatever I brought all the poly books I've I'm very familiar with scientific research on it I've taught a class on polyamory and open relationships but I think a lot of the aspects of at least American polyamory culture are kind of dominated by the same far-left you know ideologies and gender constructivist views that are absolutely handicapping to real relationships so we kind of like to keep our distance from kind of poly culture even though I think we have a huge respect for the the impulse to try to have you know a new ethical approach to relationships that's open and honest and fulfilling and adventurous and it's just kind of heartbreaking to see people try to do poly without understanding him in nature yeah I think that a lot of people engage in polyamory because they have some kind of ideological commitment right they want to show the world that it's possible to escape your monogamous programming or they have some kind of feminist agenda or even a communist agenda they don't want another person to own them they don't want to be in a contract with someone else they see exclusive monogamous relationships as some kind of wing of capitalism for example and that somebody else owns your labor and owns you as property and we really do what we do because we think it's fun and fulfilling and I mean for me I'm a utilitarian really affirmatively from an evolutionary and utilitarian perspective that I'm having the best time I can have and not because I'm trying to show people that I'm not owned or that I don't own him right it's still a quite small percentage of people actually do open relationships and poly it's not likely to become the majority anytime soon so it's almost like the people who thought that you chose to be gay or lesbian thinking we have to keep a lid on that whole homosexuality stuff because oh my god everybody would obviously turn gay if they could like know there's a certain percent of people for whom that works and I think for us it works for a certain percentage of other people polyamory probably could work very well at least for certain phases of their life but it'll be interesting to have a debate like that because I think you know the monogamists basically have the view everybody must be monogamous pretty much all the time and the reasonable polyamorous are like some people can be poly some of the time at certain life stages if they develop certain skills but we wouldn't advocate it I think for like it's not ready for primetime really yeah I guess the the question that comes up immediately is what are the skills I think the number one skill that I have that helps me is skepticism towards my own feelings so understanding that I am an evolved creature I have certain feelings and thoughts and ruminations and cognitions and just because I have a thought or I feel a negative emotion or I feel jealous for example doesn't necessarily mean that those feelings are communicating something true that I have to listen to or that I have to solve a problem to reduce right it could just be that those things are ways of managing the relationships that I'm in that are in some sense vestigial and I can figure out a way to reduce those feelings and for me in terms of all my relationships and everything I think about in terms of evolutionary psychology it goes hand to hand with meditation actually I have found meditation to be really helpful for if you take a look at your native programming if you can look at it the feelings that come up and think about what they're for from an evolutionary perspective then you can actually dissipate those emotions I think with mindfulness and I don't know if anybody else has ever talked combining these two things but that's that's how I do it yeah I think you're also unusually good at articulating what you actually want and then kind of committing to if I say I want that and then I deliver it kind of taking responsibility for saying that that I should be content with that yeah rather than sort of going back on your word and saying no I really like what I actually that was this so I think it requires a really high degree of kind of rationality being articulate having self insight having emotional maturity like polyamory is probably a bad idea for kids in high school and I think it Dinah talked about there's a kind of monogamy has a bunch of hacks and tools and norms that are really good developed over centuries polyamory has only been around basically since about 1990 in its current form and it doesn't have a bunch of those norms and hacks and the problem is poly culture is so on judgemental that they're kind of unwilling to say this works that doesn't work hey everybody let's not do that thing again so I think it has to become more kind of serious and professionalized as a as a culture that says like sorry the relationship monarchy thing just doesn't actually work because you can't create sustainable predictable commitments with a relationship the hierarchical polyamory maybe that works better but here are some ways to tweak it and prove it etc so I think if the left owns polyamory as it does now and if the left really strongly believes in the blank slate and bad communication and hypocrisy then polyamory is going to fail as a movement I mean I certainly free love in the 1960s people have tried to manifest their relationships in such a way that they are a representation of their philosophy that's happened for a long time but I do think that polyamory is trying to be a representation of the philosophy that humans are really malleable that an emotion like jealousy which obviously has a function and I would totally disagree with the idea like Christopher Ryan says that jealousy is in some sense unnatural and is the product of an agricultural society I think jealousy if you look at hunter-gatherers but you know as old as dirt as old as non-human primates jealousy is very very important and so to say I think that humans can overcome any of their emotions I think that we're socialized to have these feelings and to be possessive polyamory is a way of saying I can overcome all of those things because that is not us but that is uh and so I think the way we think about it is really different in terms of working with our evolved psychology rather than saying there is no human nature so there's like a kind of communist idealist blank slate version of polyamory that's like nobody should own anybody and we're more of a kind of libertarian polyamory that's like everybody should take responsibility for what they want and what they say and negotiate you know consensual when when relationships that are open and honest and we don't like polyamory being used as sort of a way to virtue signal leftist ideals we think it's much like you're dealing with real people to whom you have real responsibilities do you think is relevant that your evolutionary psychologists that you think this way yeah I think we two things that kind of turned me polyamorous we're number one being in evolutionary psychology and seeing the range of mating systems that are out there and thinking the range of what people actually do in modern society is perhaps overly limited right and then meeting her and saying oh she actually runs her life in a successful and rational way doing this polyamory thing that I knew very little about so as I learned about it I thought this is great there's a lot here very interesting this experimental subculture very well intentioned often but there's a lot of stuff they're doing in crazy dysfunctional ways partly because they don't understand sex differences or won't talk about them they don't understand human evolution and mating strategies they don't even understand why monogamous marriage was invented like they don't have enough respect for monogamy to actually understand like which parts of it should be challenged first and I thought that so this is a very promising subculture that might just implode under the weight of its own virtue signaling and that would be kind of project I think another polyamorous idea is that there is no limit on love that you can love everyone infinitely and that's part of also relationship anarchy that you can have these malleable relationships of people your relationships can all accommodate each other everything should be really fluid you shouldn't have any kind of stable negotiation or idea about what your relationship is going to be like with any particular person and I think that that is very difficult I think it can be very exciting obviously but I think that relationships that have no stability that have no line of Homebase can be incredibly heartbreaking can cause a tremendous amount of jealousy and especially if you're living some big cosmopolitan area and you're a young person like you're somebody young living here in inland and there's this troop of people I think called the unicorns and they're polyamorous and there was some vice documentary about their different problems and you definitely see that without kind of a home base so that any one particular person that you have a serious bond with it can actually just leave you feeling very lonely and abandoned continuously and so that's kind of one problem the other idea is that somebody can you know through talking out your problems through discussing things with people you can eradicate your jealousy with conversation right because it was socially constructed or it's it's from an agricultural society or whatever so it actually should be easy to deprogram yourself of jealousy because there's nothing deep-rooted or in you know fundamentally human about it and in some sense I you know that's a kind of growth mindset I can appreciate but on the other hand it does cause a huge amount of shame that I know of people who can't seem to relinquish their their jealousy and I know that polyamorous people sometimes look down on for example people in open relationships or swingers I actually think swinging is like a really great technique you could call it a technology of figuring out how to solve the problem of sexual boredom and also how to get the excitement of seeing your partner flirt with or being attracted to someone else it's a deeply natural thing to see your partner flirting with or interacting with somebody else who thinks that they are attractive and it definitely makes you think more of your partner's value it makes you value them more and potentially take them for granted less but we don't see our partners in contexts like that very much in a society where people are nuclear families and they're atomized so I know polyamorous people who sort of poopoo swinging but swinging is actually a really ingenious solution to that problem it's pretty hard to be jealous if you're currently having sex with somebody else and also if you as a couple have sex with other couples which is what swingers generally do then there's also a aspect of having a new experience together which can strengthen your your basic relationship the infinite love thing I keep encountering right and it's it's completely bizarre because from my point of view romantic love as an emotion right is actually a way of for a person to go here is a potential mate they seem like a good prospect I'm going to focus my mating effort on them being in love means I'm going to devote a lot of time and energy and attention to courting them and impressing them so the it is a way of taking limited resources and channeling them to a potential mate that's what romantic love or being in love is and if the polyamory people say but of an infinite it's like why do you guys use Google Calendar to organize your day then like time is finite money is finite attention is finite the amount of talking you can handle is finite if you're an introvert so why pretend that like love is infinite if every constituent element of love is finite and has to be managed carefully it's just fucking empty rhetoric sounds what you almost think about it in a masculine kind of transactional way I think transactional is is probably fair I yeah I mean you could say that I'm thinking about it in a in a masculine way well you've got quite a masculine brain in certain ways but people say transactional like that's a bad thing but we're both kind of libertarian and to us like transactional is is win-win voluntary exchanges of like goods and services and affection and commitment so if you're upfront about what the transaction is and also how likely is it to be repeated how long will it last are you committed that's a good thing because that's honest and open I think the problem with polyamory at the moment is it hasn't been around long enough right it's only been around 30 years for it to develop good kind of social norms and expectations about all these roles and how they work it would be as if you tried to run a fortune 500 company but you had just invented the concept of a boss and a laborer and management and and accounting and marketing and you were trying to invent all of it all at once right it'll probably take two or three generations before polyamory regularly works like anywhere near as well as monogamous marriage which has been under continual R&D for thousands of years yeah there's like a technology of monogamy there's common problems that you have and you can talk to your grandma or your mom about the problems you're having with your spouse and they'll have advice that they know from other people because everybody has done this whereas with polyamory it is a very weird subculture it is a subculture and actually being really clear about your expectations for other is actually a violation of many of the rules of that subculture which is that there's limitless love and you know in some sense a lot of these people are nearly limitless time that they have to expend on these multiple relationships that they're cultivating and I think maybe polyamory for busy people is what we're sort of looking at but also a technology of polyamory which is saying actually you know you have to bring evolutionary psychology and understanding and human nature and understanding of emotions and also a skeptical view of your own emotions and your own jealousy to bear otherwise it's actually not going to work because if you think everything's socialized if you think everybody is infinitely malleable and if you believe that your relationships should be able to adapt and take any form from one day to the next in an almost you know protium way then it's going to be pretty hard to organize your life around variables that are not at all consistent and the other thing that people in sort of the the polyamorous communities that I know and people on the fringes of it say is it's just endless processing it's just endless emotional labor and processing and and they find it far more difficult than a monogamous relationship just because of that kind of emotional time spent yeah so we we I know we sort of sound like very cold calculating sociopath somehow we discuss this but this is through like years of kind of bittersweet experience of realizing that if you have a clear enough frame for what you're doing and you can explain it clearly enough to other people then there's actually room for a whole lot of affection and tenderness and love and passion to flourish without all this fucking processing without all the verbal fireworks the vaguer you are it's a less well you know yourself the more you have to constantly renegotiate everything with every one so I think the typical levels of poly drama that people get into are a direct result of polyamory not having enough clear hacks for how to do this stuff efficiently and you know in monogamy there's also plenty of emotional processing drama aligned early married couples fight and one of the big points of couples therapy is to equip people with better ways to fight you know that are less destructive I think poly has to embrace that and it has to be willing to say you know the way to get to the limitless love and being able to have wonderful close relationships with people it's kind of to be just totally economic and upfront about what your your parameters are and your rules and your norms and like take the things seriously and and don't always be trying to play catch up so like well that didn't work let's process it over that failed as well let's process that's more like that's no way to live yeah so I think that we can probably emerge people do tend to have very open and honest dialogues often about how they're feeling but is not really couched in anything in particular like I think when something's couched in evolutionary psychology so for example you can ask that you can have them leave this in or not but I'm gonna I'm gonna tell a little story all right so we had a woman that we see together stay with us for several days and while we were all together I missed Jeffrey even though he was there with me the whole time but when we were all three of us together he didn't I was there he's like why would I miss you you were there right and so after she left I was very excited to have like his attention all to myself again and if from an evolutionary perspective obviously that makes sense like I'm trying to in some sense well not even just some sense in every sense we sort of monopolize David his investment and so that's why I felt so relieved and if I had no understanding about that I might feel ashamed or bad that I was excited to have him all to myself or that because I didn't actually feel jealous when we were together I just felt like I wanted his attention and I was happy to have his attention again when we got back together yeah oh you might you might miss misconstrue your unhappiness as being either my fault right or her fault we might not have the words to express what you actually wanted from me yeah and and that's the Royal Road towards serious conflict is if you don't know your own heart well enough through science right and you're just kind of kind of trying to wing it based on like well I learned this from reading that little bit of self-help and I learned this from that like tantric seminar and I learned this from taking ayahuasca and Peru and you cobble it together yourself it's really hard to make sense of some of these little issues of pom-pom because because we we've talked mostly about kind of individual the psychological aspects of it so far but there are sort of societal ramifications and I know that's something that that's eeveelution area biologist for example are very interested in it's like what would it look like if we kind of moved over wholesale towards a new religion relationship model and one of the one of the criticisms is that what would happen is that there would be a sort of a small set of hyper successful men and polygamy would degenerate into polygyny which is kind of one men one man man having access to many women what what do you make of that I start talking about two things so one thing is that I think that there's a number of different kinds of relationship architectures that you can look at and we've picked and shoot you know chosen from a variety different ideas in order to cobble together a system that kind of works for us but Dan Savage is a prominent you know sex advice columnist talks about something called monogamish which is being monogamous but then having room for outside liaisons and that can be something as small as you know somebody seeing a sex worker it can be don't-ask-don't-tell out of town kind of thing there's all kinds of different ways of looking at it and so this monogamish actually seems to me the most stable relationship architecture so I don't think that polyamory is necessarily super stable especially not as its practiced overall and there's a couple reasons why I think monogamish is more stable than straight monogamous right one of these ideas is that in monogamous culture there's this idea that if you want to have sex with or you have a crush on or you have romantic ruminations about someone else it means there's something lacking and you're kind of home base pair relationship and that's I think a very pernicious and bad idea and so what happens sometimes is that one person or the other will start to fantasize about a third person and then they'll think okay I'm risking so much in terms of my main relationship by having fantasies about this other person that cognitive dissonance clicks in and they think I must be really in love with this other person and not all of my partner if I'm willing to take these risks for this other person and then what will sometimes happen is you know this new relationship energy right there's this flurry of excitement about this other person and then ultimately it burns out you don't know the person as well as you thought you did for example so I think we evolved in a system where there was a lot of monogamy at least for several years oftentimes while children were young but there's also a lot of dalliance --is and there was a lot of Affairs and there was a lot of seeing you know who you were going to see next and so I think that monogamish which is having some outside allowance reduces the chance of a stable relationship necessarily breaking up because the person who cheats for example or who asks to make a negotiation isn't risking everything and also the idea isn't that if you want to sleep with somebody else it means that your primary relationship is is doomed or is you're not in love with that person anymore the other thing people have to understand is meeting market dynamics and like what's the local sex ratio what is this distribution of mate values that's relevant how do people pair up I mean the weird thing is you see a lot of people in their twenties doing casual dating which is basically disorganized unethical polyamory that's unselfishly telling anybody they're dating like who else they're dating what their commitment level is you know are they getting regular STI testing all the while and I think it remains to be seen like a what percent of men and what percent of women can handle you know open honest polyamory and B what are the kind of mating market results of that I think in certain contexts like China we have this huge access of unmarried single men who aren't going to be able to find monogamous women certain kinds of polyamory might be a really good idea for the Chinese government to kind of consider because otherwise like what's their what's their release valve for tens of millions of guys who can't find a girlfriend that is not a recipe for social stability so again I think it's the the important thing is to kind of recognize this is an experimental subculture we need to have like clear metrics of success we need to be honest about the pros and cons we need to be respectful of traditional marriage and monogamy and go there's a lot of embodied wisdom and what a lot of people do and you can't just reject it before you understand it right there's a kind of Chesterton's fence issue here like we think we understand monogamous marriage more than most people do because we've lived an alternative to it and we kind of know what kind of costs and benefits are and what would have to be managed in terms of boredom also in terms of you know women like high status men and if you are around your mate all the time especially in isolated nuclear households and you never see anyone else admiring your mate or flirting with your mate or trying to gossip about you so they can steal your mate then you get no cues at all that they're desirable to anybody else and that is a very very unnatural environment artificial environment when people talk about this top percent of percentage of women whatever 15 percent 20 percent being competed for by the vast majority of women and the fees are the men who are getting all the mating opportunities they think that polyamory and open relationships is simply going to exacerbate that problem and that the men who are the in cells or who are losing out on the mating game are just gonna lose harder but I haven't really had that experience at all so I've been involved in these kind of cultures of that are very matriarchal where it's a lot of women that date various different men and they all vouch for certain men and they'll often there's just so little jealousy about men they'll say this guy just makes a wonderful meal and he will take you on a really lovely date and so the kind of man who wouldn't necessarily make a good full-time boyfriend or who potentially needs leveling up before they get to the point where they can be a good full time boyfriend is actually the kind of person who'd be great to see once a week right so there's this idea of something called a relationship escalator which is you start seeing each other you know every once in a while then you see each other more than you move in together then you get married then you have children then you die and that is the relationship escalator and kind of an alternative to that is that and people find this really profoundly unromantic but I think about the people I date and the and the kind of social and sexual sphere that I'm in as kind of a marketplace right I have people that I trade with right more most often and that I engage with most often there are really blurry lines between friends and lovers and obviously people can come in and out of my life and in various different roles but I have an idea about what you know what I want from somebody else and what role they'll fulfill and they don't have to be everything and ever and and all things to me and so that puts a lot less pressure on them but also we get to enjoy each other and we get to enjoy a certain amount of variety that we wouldn't be able to if we were just closed off to one another and in terms of strengthening the primary relationship that I'm in with Jeffrey I see him having other people admiring him having other people flirt with him I see how he manages other relations with other people and it actually causes me to admire him more and to think that I'm getting a better deal and also to be happier to share him because in that sense if somebody is high status and is admired by multiple people then you're getting a sharing is better than having one person all to yourself that no one else wants well also you're really good at like taking kind of weird-ass be eccentric guys and who would not make good primary boyfriends and kind of leveling them up and training them so that they are then presentable to other women right and that's the thing you've done you've done multiple times so it's actually really good for those you know in cells yeah like to meet a woman like her who can kind of go okay you're not quite good enough to be full time boyfriend right but you have certain traits that are enjoyable and here's how to cultivate your other traits and I think that's a better path for those like SPS or in cells or whatever to to meet someone like her rather than to kind of like meet a woman is saying okay you're a dysfunctional broken young man but you're the best I can get as a woman because I'm also kind of just like that's that's not a good way forward okay yeah that's totally fair yet I and I have done that I mean like this is why you take a loan on the date this is ya know and I and I and III like ASPI men cuz I like the way they think and I like that kind of systemising thing but also I'm very transparent my facial expressions are very transparent I'm very clear about what I want and so I think that women can learn a lot and and aspies I mean now we're going on about talking about dating a space but they actually can be really great today because they do want to make you happy they just don't know how to do it with unconscious or cues or reading facial expressions or whatever if you tell somebody exactly what you want and they want to make you happy it's very easy it's only when you have an expectation that somebody's going to infer what you want that you have these various different problems and if somebody figures out what a woman wants it's a lot easier to figure out what other women want afterwards but yeah definitely I've dated guys who I've you know never had a girlfriend before and being like I actually can't be your full-time girlfriend your job this week is to go on four dates you tell me how they are and and I really love to do that it's it's not a chore at all yeah famously Jordan Peterson got into trouble for talking about enforcement agha me and his point I think was that monogamy evolved it's societally and culturally enforced and it's an evolutionary trait so as evolutionary psychologists are you not persuaded by the argument that monogamy has evolved time and time again in cultures as I kind of as a way of coping with with the pressures of life and a way of furthering the species yeah so monogamy has been very important because the men who are the most likely to be violent and the most likely to cause problems in any given society are those men who are out of the mating game so men who don't have a wife or girlfriend or many times more likely to engage in homicide or really risky bad behavior one of the best predictors of a young man cleaning his life up is actually him getting a girlfriend or a wife for example and so young men who are unmated or who don't have the faculties like the resources or whatever to get a long-term mate have always been dangerous in society and so what you've seen is there's been monogamy as a cultural beam that has enabled these men to each be assigned a woman and thus it actually reduces the kind of likelihood of insurgents for example so that does make sense right but what I think Jordan Peterson is failing to understand is that if there were more people who are having open relationships and some young men for example who were not necessarily good material for a woman to date full-time but we're good enough for somebody or a couple women to see casually that guy I think is just as unlikely to engage in difficult and aggressive and criminal behavior as somebody who is married right yeah I mean if a guy is really not good husband material and you kind of shoe him shoehorn him into husband role but kind of against his wishes like he's he's just not really capable of that kind of sexual commitment well you're basically asking is for some poor woman to fall on the sword for the greater good of society to put up with this motherfucker and and like do the best she can with him whereas in a polyamorous society he might be able to find women who actually kind of like his dark streak or has bad bonus or the fact that he spends you know three out of four weeks working on some oil rig somewhere or whatever there's just more flexibility so just the way that the free market with money is better than a barter economy right a polyamorous society could be better for everybody in terms of exchanging sex and romance than trying to fit everybody into this monogamous paradigm another thing that that people who are kind of more traditionalist talk about a lot is about how if there were more polyamorous people and there was more kind of casual non-exclusive negotiated relationships that fewer people would be have investing fathers right we're not really sure exactly how much a investing father figure is actually important so it does seem like it could be quite important but it also seems like men who are likely to leave also have certain genetic qualities right they tend to be more promiscuous they tend to be more criminal for example and so it's very hard to tease apart the environmental and the genetic effects so I know that some people think that if you've made polyamory more popular that there would be many fewer investing fathers in the picture but I think that the irony is it's not that hard part the effects you do a large twin study and you can tease them apart and what we find is in fact almost all of the traits that people say are due to apps and fathers are actually heritable traits that are not much influenced by family structure so right the irony is a lot of the people who are saying we need monogamy because we need dads because we need role models and who you know in other contexts will be like you should never ignore the behavior genetics but in this domain they're ignoring the behavior genetics and like they're making a kind of blank slate argument that says it really really deeply matters that you have a stable family home or else the kid will grow up to be a terrible person it's like that is not what the twin studies show and do you think you your typical in your emotional reactions or or is there something special about the way that you guys are able to approach it that that is different to how most people approach their relationships that's why I don't think I often say I don't endorse polyamory like I don't endorse my particular relationship style I just sort of endorse certain kind of tactics and I definitely need to get all this kind of down in blogs or on paper at some point but yeah I'm really strange in many ways like I'm unusual I'm not you know neurotypical in a lot of ways so I tend to not feel bad feelings for very long and I tend to have a even when I was a child I had quite a kind of utilitarian way of thinking about things so my view has always been if I'm distressed or I feel bad or I feel jealous if for example because of me being able to be stoical about those feelings or being able to manage those feelings Jeffery and somebody that I like especially somebody I like if they're enjoying each other's company then I'm actually doing something kind of for the greater good right I'm and and I think Jeffrey is wonderful so in some sense I feel I was feel guilty monopolizing him entirely and it's actually very much the kind of utilitarian reasons that I think about it and most people would not think about things that way and instead they would think about how they were maximizing their cues of commitment and loyalty by acting incredibly jealously or by having a proprietary feeling about somebody so I think in that way I'm unusual I have a very kind of high hedonic state I'm happy all this - and basically what I'm trying to say yeah you're you're happy I think it helps that you're bisexual yeah it helps a lot of asexual yeah so so I there's this concept that red pill people use a lot which is called hypergamy and hypergamy is a woman's desire to be with a man who's higher and status than than she is and you see this in romance novels all the time women who are with billionaires millionaires sheriff's Kings whatever the case may be and so the way that I manage my jealousy to a great extent is because I'm attracted often to the women that Jeffery sees and also because I think about him having high status the best indicator of a man's status is how many women like him and desire him because women are really really good at sussing out how quality a man is so if Jeffery has other women who are interested in him it increases my perception of how good he is and it actually makes me feel really in love and excited about him right so that's kind of how I deal with it and that's a kind of a very primitive emotion like this you have status me watching the different primitive but I really it has really good outcomes in terms of me manage my jealousy so i inflate that emotion and I use it all the time in order to enjoy whatever it is that we've negotiated yeah I'm just a speii it's always I mean I'm very rational and very systematizing I seek out principled solutions to issues things that make sense I hate inconsistency I hate hypocrisy and so it was very a lot of people in polyamory who were good at it I think have a little bit of that Asperger II sort of hyper rationality because they're willing to kind of take a step back from skate track of the calendars you go to be great yeah like systematizing and and to be able to take a step back from your kind of monogamist background and think seriously about alternatives I think it helps to have a kind of experimental scientific attitude and a kind of epistemic humility also that says man I don't know we're just gonna try it out and see what happens and learn as we go and try to keep notes about what succeeds and fails yeah I mean we're also sort of irreplaceable to each other this is gonna sound really romantic but I don't want to too soon basically we're both really unusual in several different ways right I actually tend to attract people who are a speii because I'm incredibly emotionally transparent and my facial expressions very transparent and it doesn't bother me to say exactly what I want I think many women don't want to say exactly what they want because part of the cue investment that they're looking for is for somebody to use enough cognitive cycles to guess what they want so I think that that's a big part of it but we are very unusually suited to one another and we are irreplaceable to one another so that's why we can have a hierarchical relationship where I'm not worried that somebody's gonna replace me or that anybody's going to replace him but most people if you look at tinder how would you know about somebody if you look at them on tinder you know that they live close by and you know what their face looks like maybe right but people get married with people that they meet on tinder all the time back in the day people would get married to people who just lived around the corner so proximity and attraction are the main reasons that people get together not because they have any deep-seated interesting stuff in common or that they have unusual you know lifestyles or whatever the case may be so if two people all they have in common is that they're nice to each other and they're attracted to each other they are infinitely replaceable by anybody else and it's going to be very difficult for them to do hierarchical poly without somebody else you know coming in and taking people's places again and again and again and that's what you see also in polyamorous communities a lot is this constant kind of switching of partners and the endless conversations that people have emotional conversations and I actually think that people like that I think that's why they do it otherwise or or they don't have anything else fulfilling in their lives so it's something that they're trying to maximize another way that people can have unique things in common and you see this a lot it's somebody will be monogamous for a long time and then they'll open up their relationship a little bit and as Dan Savage says just because you open up your relationship doesn't mean you have to blow the door off its hinges right you can have a relationship opened up a little bit and there's this terrible bias unfortunately in that you hear all the time about people who say we opened up our relationship everything went to shit and now we're broken up you very rarely hear because so many people are on the down low or in the closet about having open relationships we decided to have an open relationship and everything worked out marvelously right and so yeah maybe it's the case that people open their relationships up and it's more likely to end badly but we wouldn't know because we have a completely biased sample we only hear about how open relationships screw things up because that's the only time we hear about people having opened up their relationship just like attention I think I think yeah we feel like it's important but also it is one way in which we use evolutionary psychology in our day-to-day lives and our knowledge about the psychology of relationships I think it's important for people to have to be able to see couples who are like reasonable people and not sort of freaky California and New Age delusional like being able to do a open relationship and talk about it honestly it's pros and it's cons and why it wouldn't necessarily work for everybody and not sort of proselytize it recklessly I think that's really important because if folks like us are sort of on the down-low and lie quietly doing open and we're only letting the most extreme weird people show up on reality TV as like the exemplars apollyon I think that's terrible right it would be like if the only examples of monogamous marriage that you ever saw were just people fighting during divorce court like that doesn't make monogamy look very good either you said proselytising then and I think that kind of links into what I think some people feel so triggered maybe by certain aspects of poly culture which kind of fear feels like people are sort of IVA evangelizing it and saying well it's the next evolutionary step there's this kind of it either implicit or explicit kind of sense of well you're just not evolved enough if you were more evolved you would be poly and monogamy is something that we're going to evolve past you don't think what do you make of that there is that sort of sense in some areas of the poly community oh yeah a lot of them have have a sort of progressive utopian cult that eventually like in a hundred years everyone will be enlightened and polyamorous now able to overcome their jealousy programming in Bubba and and I think the percentage of people who are in successful poly and open relationships or swingers will increase it already is increasing especially among the other people but I don't think monogamous marriage is going to evaporate anytime soon it has many many benefits to individuals couples kids civilization etc my main concern is just create the broadest market that you can for for different mating systems be experimental see what works trade information about successes and failures and then hopefully in a couple more generations will have a sort of sense of like these are the top three or four kinds of relationships that tend to work pretty well for most people and one of those might be monogamous marriage one of them probably will be hierarchical Polly there might be a couple of others people in bet I don't know I mean people have definitely said stuff about you know Twitter people actually very really come after me on Twitter it's not an invitation by the way and they say it's kind of elitist the way we say like oh you kind of have to have very high emotional intelligence you have to be smart you have to be have a unique bond in order to be polyamorous mostly I've seen polyamorous people say that anybody can be polyamorous and I have followed some polyamorous groups and places like small cities in England to see all of the crazy drama that gets kicked up there because people are managing relationships without any kind of understanding of human nature I think so it's important I think to talk about it but I also think it's important for people to be able to evaluate themselves and for some people to say no I really want to be monogamous with somebody long-term but to consider actually that both men and women have desire for sexual and romantic variety that wanting to have sex with somebody else doesn't necessarily mean that you've fallen out of love with the person that you're with and also to examine how this this very isolated culture that we've put together where people don't live in any kind of communal way where they live really you know isolated from everyone else about how that's also contributing to this monogamous culture where people are really starving for even outside friendship and I think one thing that polyamory does is because you know when you have lovers or friends who are also sometimes lovers you actually just develop closer bonds with them and it's helped me have a much more whatever I think clothes expanded network than people I know who are monogamous and that's nothing a big difference between people people who go to church tend to be happier than people who don't but also people in unique sexual subcultures tend to be happier in their relationships because they're extended network has this this pleasurable component which knits them together more tightly than other kinds of groups would would be together I saw Brett Weinstein tweet the other day saying so he's a skeptic about polyamory but he said if anyone can pull this off then Jeffrey and Diana can pull it off I think someone else novella bellows but we'll do that you say that too so that's kind so if you can't then I guess nobody can are you comfortable holding that much responsibility no I mean no because life is stochastic and like we could fuck it up and hopefully we won't yeah but we couldn't fuck it up and this is why it's so important to have a wider variety of people kind of coming out and saying we're swingers were open or poly and people who like actually have like paid jobs and not and who don't necessarily live in Southern California and who don't necessarily just hang out with other Burning Man people to kind of normalize it right the way that gay and lesbian culture got normalized in the 90s with like sitcoms that showed oh you can be gay and employed right and in a committed relationship and I think you know it's very kind for for folks to say well if we two can't succeed nobody can but it's not like we have some weird poly superpower it's just that we're smart people who've worked really hard to get in touch with our emotions who've learned all we can about poly culture who have the appropriate degree of skepticism about it and to have a deep and abiding respect for tradition and monogamy and marriage and don't just reject it all those bullshit and who go like like polyamory to me like might be 30% better than monogamous marriage but it's not like eight thousand percent better yeah and I do think that it you know comes down to you know people trying things out their personal experience jealousy can be desensitized it takes a really long time but you know when you talk about the elephant in the Ryder this kind of analogy about the mind people just imagine how jealous they would feel if their partner went off with somebody else right and then right away that makes them have a moral problem with any talk about polyamory and I've heard people you know had conversations with lots of people who were otherwise totally rational about you know they can be totally rational but like organ markets and legalized prostitution and all this other stuff and then you get to polyamory and they're just immediately thinking about their partner in flagrante delicto with somebody else they're like no it's super wrong it's terrible and you know you have to think about where your response is coming from all of us endorse or or or have serious problems with the ideologies based on how we would think it would affect us so I think this kind of idea about civilizational collapse is just one way of people actually managing their own feelings Geoffrey Diana thank you very much [Music] you [Music]
