[Music] what I found particularly helpful was arriving here and it being mostly strangers and by the end of the weekend we're able to offer each other insights that are deeply powerful and very insightful that not just make me feel good at the moment but I can take away in harness in my everyday life it's not teaching somebody a set of ideas it's enabling people to feel what it actually feels like to be a man and in doing that honoring what it is to be a man and also the love from contributions from women as well so I think it's really important this kind of work exists right now I truly believe that men need the support of other men to heal certain things in themselves and to get a sense of brotherhood and connection with other men to learn how to be a man and very few of us got this from our fathers so being able to give this to each other in a space like this is really valuable every man should do this you know like there's not enough good positive role models and information for men there educates men on how to be better men and we all need them as a species there is a real act of courage require to fully show up and tell the truth to other men and you know for me doesn't come naturally necessarily to give that level of trust but the more the space builds and the more the trust builds within the group the easier that becomes and then the feeling is one not just of release but one of dignity and strength and being kind of fully in my power I felt freedom to just let go and not hold back and that was really liberating and also just makes you see how everyday you go and make yourself small and you compromise and you don't step fully into your potential and that that was something I really felt in that room I'm getting a glimpse of hey what if you just dared it was incredibly constructive it you know things I am a father I intend to pass lots of these teachings to my son I think there's lots of stuff to have done today that will make me a better man I believe that in spaces like this we really get to feel those masculine energies the fires the vulnerability whatever but in a space of understanding that no actually this is a beautiful gift you know it's something something to be trusted something the world really really needs you never knew that you were missing this but you are you you don't know that this is what you've actually wanted your entire life but it is for our upcoming events check the rebel wisdom website [Music] you
