hey guys this is a very short video announcing the very first rebel wisdom QA so what we'd love is if you write your questions in the comments below this video and we will answer them on Thursday so you can ask about anything we've recently put out our latest podcast about the Jordan Peterson sam Harris talk there's been some really high-quality comments already and it feels like there is a sort of little community starting to build around the content we're putting out which is great something we really want to encourage and if you guys have any got got any ideas about how to encourage that a little bit more we're pretty new to this we made our first film in January and we're still learning so if you've got any suggestions for how to build community how to start creating the kind of conversation that we want to see we're really open to those kind of questions and any advice ultimately I think what we're looking for is to create a space to have a genuinely generative conversation about some of the most interesting and important philosophical cultural questions that are going on at the moment and I guess that's why we're sort of why we were interested in Jordan Peterson why we're interested in the intellectual dark web because especially the intellectual dark web feels like it's a way of trying to have to carve out a space to be able to have these kind of conversations in public like you don't have to agree you may have very different views but how do we have conversations that feel like people are open-minded that they have the possibility of change in their mind of learning of and that's the energy that we want to bring and that's the energy that we're inviting you guys to bring as well so ask your questions like the comments dislike the comments and we will yeah well we'll answer that will allow you guys to select which questions we answer on Thursday thank you very much
