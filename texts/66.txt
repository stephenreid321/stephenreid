as the tech revolution continues to destroy old media the Internet is fueling a new intellectual awakening television made people look stupider than they were it turns out that people are smarter with longer attention spans then we thought I'm a journalist and filmmaker for many years I made documentaries for the likes of the BBC and channel 4 but I don't think the mainstream media can provide the level of analysis and insight we need for the extraordinary times we're going through where the old structures that made sense of the world break down it's like we're entering just entering into the underworld and it's a descent we're feeling everything starting to shake and the center cannot hold and when our ways of thinking break down it's the rebels and the Renegades who dare to think differently who are needed to reboot the system and so what's happening is that people are perceiving because it's becoming increasingly obvious that all of these artifacts of the way that we've gone about doing civilization are breaking down and failing in a way that is no longer easy to pretend isn't happening and so as a consequence this triggers a deep visceral sense and that's a good thing right because that deep visceral sense is the return to the aluminum the return to the mystery the shift that we are on the precipice of is not like the shift from the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment it's like more like a shift from single cell to multicellular life these are the people and ideas rebel wisdom is searching out to try to make sense of the growing chaos the evolution screwed up it handed us the tools to recognize that we don't have to value the game that it is playing and that we can now repurpose the hardware to something that's actually worthwhile that's what I actually had hope in is that if enough people can come to that realization then then we wake up and not in some evangelical megachurch kind of way of being born again but in in a truly initiatory way being born again of like I know my purpose I know my part and I'm willing to practice resurrection I'm willing to offer my life fully and freely in love in every moment and then we're invincible like then we can turn things on a dime it's also about trying to create a new form of conversation one based on genuine dialogue letting go of ideology and fix ideas so we want to be a place that hosts this new form of conversation both online and at our events check out our films join the conversation and to get early access to some great films and exclusive content please consider supporting us on patreon [Music]
