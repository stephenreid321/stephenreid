I'm very excited to do this interview I first I was a TV journalist for many years I worked for Channel 4 News and I first covered psychedelic therapy back in 2008 with Michael MIT offers work with MDMA therapy and so I've been watching this at this area for a long time and being very excited about it and it feels like I remember when your New Yorker article came out 2014 yeah and I remember thinking that was a really seminal moment that a writer I just do a short introduction to you you're you're an author of many New York Times bestseller books and were were rated one of the hundred most influential people by Time magazine in 2010 but it's fair to say that you're you're a very successful writer and it's it's wonderful to see a man to see you go into this area where do you sense this conversation is at cuz I I felt for a while like psychedelic therapy is something that is coming into the mainstream yeah I think that's right and and on the evidence of my book tour and the publication of his book and the response to this book the culture seems to be at an inflection point and things are changing and that there is an openness to this topic that I didn't expect to find the fact that the mainstream media has expressed so much interest in this the fact that I'm talking to audiences who were not Psychonauts really mainstream audiences and they're all ears and I think that owes a lot to the the research being done on therapeutic applications I think that a lot of people are suffering out there there's a tremendous problem with depression and suicide and addiction and they're very few tools available to the mental health community and and so the the openness hunger for a new one that might you know that showing some promise is I think really galvanizing the interest so if the New Yorker article was kind of a seminal moment surely the book is even more of a seminal moment yeah we'll see I mean you know history will tell but so far the the book has has flabbergasted me I mean that it's been so positive and and that we didn't know if your average book reader or my average reader would want to buy a book on psychedelics people don't know how to do that they know how to book a buy a book about food or nature you know the other topics I've written about but he was one that was you know we just didn't know that there would be people would be comfortable owning a book about psychedelics let alone reading it and but it appears they are and and some of it is because it's not just a book on psychedelics it's really a book about the mind and what psychedelics teaches us about the mind which is quite extraordinary and the mind as it works in in in people who are well and the mind as it doesn't work in people who are struggling with mental illness so you know I think a lot of people are interested for that reason because they are struggling and but I'm amazed also at how many people read the book or come hear a talk and are clearly very excited about the possibility of doing saying they may never have done before and it I haven't filled a sense of responsibility about that but it's very interesting that people once they read about this they they have a they feel they have to go through a thought process do I want to do this or do I not want to do this you know I read lots of books where I don't go through that thought process do I want to climb Everest or not climbing over I don't even think about it I'm interesting because I read cooked book about food and I started doing fermentor yeah but that was my goal is to inspire people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily do and and maybe that's something about my work that it could be it I don't know that people do want to do this stuff that I described so but I you know there's a sense of responsibility that goes with that because it's not for everyone and people do run into trouble and when the drugs are used carelessly people have kidnapped real psychological trials and so I you know I'm just concerned that people approach it with the kind of momenta sness that I it was a big deal and I was you know I didn't go easily into this world I had I had lots of reluctance I had to overcome I was very reluctant psychonaut because it's interesting when I first heard that you were writing about this I thought he must be an old hippie and he's kind of but it that's not the case at all when I read the book and listened to a podcast I had very little experience and no I had had no major psychedelic experience I had had a couple I've heard hear people refer to as museum doses of psilocybin or aesthetic doses you know which are you know not I mean like smoking cannabis or something like that but you know the full-blown ego dissolving psychedelic trip no I didn't have that till I was nearly 60 because can you tell me a bit about that it's quite interesting from a cultural perspective that you didn't quite get the first 60s way you got more of the the backlash against it is that is that first yeah I grew up I came of age the the moment at which I would even think about taking a psychedelic would have been you know 68 to 70 and this is in the this is in the full flowering of this panic that hit especially in America but I think it was true here too and in America you know psychedelics got left the laboratory and got you know embraced by the counterculture and it was many straight people and older people thought that it was fueling the reluctance of American boys to go to Vietnam and yeah oh I'm sure it was I mean there was something very anti-authoritarian about the the gist of the experience people were having they were questioning all authorities and all games were looked at as games and whether that was inherent in the molecule or just the context in which was being taken we don't really know but certainly President Nixon saw it as a big threat he called Timothy Leary who already was like a washed-up psychology professor he called him the most dangerous man in America because he was urging everybody to turn on tune in and drop out and people were doing that lots of people were dropping out they were washing up in haight-ashbury or going to you know communes in Northern California and Tennessee and it was a very disruptive time and to some people this was incredibly exciting and it and it did help create the world we live in now environmental movement feminism I mean the way we eat all these things are sixties products but to many people it was terrifying and and the gap in particular between the young and the old was really emphasized by LSD and experience that the young were having a rite of passage the young were having that the the elders did not understand and that's not usually how it works with rites of passage usually they knit a society together this was a weird one so it was so I was hearing all the scare stories I was hearing about you know people staring at the Sun till they go blind or the guy who had so much orange sunshine he thought he was an orange for the rest of his life and you know there were like crazy stories but there were true stories too there were you know people doing stupid horror stories of what what came out towards the end of the 60s as well ya know the scene got very dark and sour and and that's what I in baibe was like wow LSD you're you know you're playing Russian roulette with your brain and and I also didn't feel psychologically sturdy enough to withstand such an assault or what I thought would be such an assault so you think you were right to think that I think probably I was certainly in my teen years maybe in my 20s would be different you know and people have asked me do I regret not having done it then and I don't really I don't know how things would have been different had I done it and as I say in the book I really think they have special value actually when you get older you know I said there's kind of a throwaway line in the book that psychedelics may be wasted on the young and I know that's unfair cuz a lot of young people have had very important transformative experiences but I think they're particularly valuable when you're more set in your ways and you have all this material all this life behind you to process and figure out and all these issues that have formed and your thought patterns have have gotten rigid you know you're in your deep in your grooves of how you respond to any given situation you have these very handy mental algorithms but they also are a trap and and psychedelics can spring you from that trap sort of some sense in spirituality at least you need a strong ego to be able to yeah to go beyond it and that's a real question about you know people who are fifteen or sixteen don't yet have a fully formed you go and and so what does it mean to have an ego dissolving experience at that point I don't know I mean and actually maybe they're not having that experience maybe they're having more of a museum experience it's it's more of an outward experience for people who are doing it recreationally I use that word advisedly because I because it sounds dismissive and I don't mean it that way at all but the kind of experience people are having in the therapeutic context or in the underground guided context is a very internal experience you're wearing eye shades you're listening to music you're not just getting off on the sensory information coming in with the exception of the music and that's a substantially different experience it's a much more psychoanalytic experience really you yeah its internal and you're processing the people in your lives the things you've done your belief system and I don't think that's how an 18 year old uses it it's interesting as well I've heard I think it was the Sam Harris podcast where you talked about your sort of spiritual beliefs or perhaps lack of spiritual beliefs going into it because very interesting I'd read cooked and in defense of food and what I found in it in defense of food in particular was was a sort of mysticism of the natural world in that there's a skepticism about what you called kind of nutritionism yeah productiveness of science yes exactly reductive scientific materialism of it somehow removes the ineffable quality of your food for example so would you say that's an accurate description the natural mr. Simonet it's not it's a critique of science and the way science goes about understanding something like flow we didn't it fails to see it sees food as a pile of chemicals which is not a very fulsome description of food because food in addition to being having nutrients has a structure and that structure is very important it also is a set of relationships right when you eat your your connecting to the to the natural world to the earth to the to the species you're eating to other people it's a communal experience so a so it's an argument I don't know if it's a mystical argument but it's an argument for the more holistic way of thinking about it and I mean people read that book and botany of desire and see spirituality in it and and the fact that in botany of desire you know the subtitle is a plants I view of the world there's a lot of imaginative effort to see things from the plants point of view but to me that was kind of an intellectual conceit after my psychedelic experiences it became like a very firmly held oh my god that's all true they do have subjectivity I can feel it there regarding me in some sense the plants so but but but I think the main thing that happened was my understanding of what spirituality was shifted I had always thought that spiritual the opposite of spiritual was material and if he believed in the spiritual it meant you believed in the supernatural or the mystical saying which most people assume means supernatural and I've never been prepared to give up on the laws of nature and that that everything you know nature is everything that there is and we may not understand it all but there's there's you don't transcend it and but I but what I learned through these experiences that were incredibly powerful and there were all experiences of connection connection to nature connection to people in my life the feelings of love I had for my wife and my son and my sisters and my mother and father I realized that those that the essence of spirituality to me at least and obviously can be different for different people was that overwhelmingly powerful connection and that what keeps us from feeling that connection in ordinary hours and days is is the ego and the defenses of the ego and the fact that the brain is tuned to novelty rather than the familiar - I think that hides that hides important things from us because we're our brains are always looking for changes in the environment as well they should it's very adaptive but it misses a lot it blinds us to important things so I realized the opposite of spiritual is not the material it's egotistical and to the extent you can transcend your ego you will have spiritual experiences and they're right at hand you know it's just about your perspective there's plenty of wonder without stipulating a beyond so anyway it may be an inadequate definition of spiritual for some people but I now I feel much more comfortable in that camp a spiritual person yeah I guess that you could it's more kind of expanding the concept of what materialism is that's right rather dismiss right oh yeah are denying it or video yeah yes exactly and that there's plenty of wonder right here in the in this room yeah and what would you how do you sum up how you were changed by this journey this right in this book well in that way that was a very important change in my understanding of what mattered and how the world worked so that was a big deal I think as a result I mean the big thing that happened to me is acquiring a little bit more distance or fresh perspective on my ego and realizing I don't have to identify with it all the time and that it is a tool and it gets up to some tricks I don't like and I don't always have to listen to that voice and there are other voices and that sounds crazy you know if you were a psychiatrist that's not what I mean but that there's another ground on which to stand besides ego consciousness and that it's it's hard to reach that other ground I had a glimpse of it during at least one of my psychedelic experiences but it is something you can cultivate through meditation through recognizing when your defenses are springing into gear that no that's what that is and you know there are other ways to get there than psychedelics you know people get there through psychotherapy but it happened much faster and psychedelics so that's been really valuable change if you ask my wife she would say that she thinks I'm much more open much more comfortable talking about emotional topics less defensive so yeah she was very worried at the beginning that I would change in ways that you know she I mean she she she had trepidations about it cuz you know we'd been together a long time in here I was having a big experience that she wasn't having that hasn't happened you know we had a kid together all these all the big experiences in our lives we did together death was deaf parents and things like that but here was one I was gonna go off on my own and she was very concerned about it but in the end what she didn't consider that I might change for the better right and she said it I have so what were you most excited to discover during writing the book oh so much I mean the neuroscience was fascinating to learn about and it was something I knew nothing about I really hadn't studied the brain in any way I didn't I wasn't someone who read books on neuroscience or consciousness studies and and all that what we're learning what psychedelics teaching us about the brain is incredible and the mind I mean I really do see it as a tool and you know there's this outrageous quote from stanislav grof from years ago in the 60s he said that psychedelics would be for the study of the mind what what the telescope was for that for astronomy and what the microscope was for biology and you know that was really an outrageous thing to say David not saying the same thing yeah yeah and Robin Carhartt Harris too and so I don't think it's crazy anymore and it's taught me a lot about the mind and so the study of psychedelics and psychedelics themselves are teaching us really valuable things about the mind that was thrilling the history was thrilling I had no idea what was going on before Timothy Leary before the 1960s that there was this very fertile period of research all through the 50s where interesting discoveries were being made and incredible characters were were roaming the stage of history that have been completely forgotten people like Al Hubbard and Humphry Osmond and so that one said well yeah Hollingshead Sidney Cohen and la Betsey Eisner in LA I mean these names are not known to people but they're really interesting characters doing very serious work and it's like Timothy Leary has taken up all the oxygen in the room and and it's a shame I mean his story is very interesting and I'm I take pains to tell it in a new way but but the fact is they're their characters even more interesting than he is and so as a writer I had a very it was a really exciting period of discovery I mean you know usually when you write a book like some chapters you're really excited about and some you just have to get from point A to point B I never had that feeling here every chapter I was I was finding a new world and it was an undiscovered world and so it was it was a thrill actually to write and then the trip you know writing about my own trips I'd never written I'd never I mean I'm a nonfiction writer I'm a journalist I I'm used to working in this very tight constraint of these this box of facts that can all be fact checked and here I was writing about saying that was the pure product of my imagination and I imagine it's it's kind of what a novelist does you know that they they have to hear dialogue they have a movie running in their heads that they're writing writing down and then maybe an overly simplistic way to look at it but I so I was in that space and as a writer that was even though I had a lot of trepidations about how can you make a trip interesting it's such an internal thing and it's you know isn't it like a dream who's interested in other people's dreams I'm certainly not but as it turns out it's not like a dream in many ways it's much more concrete much more kind of narrative li coherent and writing about that was turned out to be a thrill I mean it was kind of the Everest in the middle of the book that I kept my gone right now I got to get to this part and how am I gonna get up this mountain but once I found the voice in which to do it which took a little doing and a few false starts it was great fun and whether I succeeded obviously for the reader to decide but so yeah so as a writing project this was fantastic as a learning project was fantastic and as a personal project I had a lot of skin in this game you know this wasn't it just a cool journalistic inquiry their chapters that are that but then their chapters where I'm kind of you know I've gotta you know I'm putting myself into this situation a situation that I had a lot of reluctance about that was very and it was very exposing and this is definitely my most personal book and there wasn't a way to do it without just saying well don't you can't worry about how you look you just have to be truthful to the experience there's a sense as well I mean you you've you've got a lot of credibility from your previous work from your food work and I guess this area we talk about kind of synchronicity or we talk about kind of there being some greater meaning to to what's going on is there a sense that you were meant to write this book do you do you have any any sympathy with that no I don't I mean other people could have written this book you know I was lucky it was lucky I stumbled on when I did I do realize now that for many people I was the right messenger I didn't write it thinking that I mean as a writer I don't think that I have this this bag of credibility I can bring and distribute over other topics I feel you have to earn your credibility your authority as a writer every every book every article you can't if you just write because I'm so-and-so and you know and that's that's not how you readers are not interested in that I mean that's speechifying that's lecturing and that's not what I do I started from the beginning and mastered this topic but I realized too many readers as like Michael Pollan's writing about this it must not be too crazy he didn't leave me wrong on on food there was a woman I did an event at Google in Seattle and this woman stood up and she's like in her 30s you know a coder or something like that very successful and she said you know I read Omnivore's Dilemma and I had to learn how to how to slaughter and butcher a pig and I had no idea as I was driving to work today that now I would have to take LSD so I you know I told her she didn't have to take us tea maybe she wants to learn how to meditate there are other ways to achieve these states of consciousness but yeah I guess some people feel that way about what I write do you have any concerns because there is something there is a sort of question as to whether the psychedelic experience is a natural fit for the scientific method or for the medical method you have any sort of concerns there's something kind of almost ungraspable or ineffable about the experience yeah that that's proven a difficult fit with both of those models in the past without question I mean how do you control a psychedelic trial can you really control it and no and not know who's got the got the psychedelic and who didn't you know some of the researchers say they've successfully fooled even their their their therapy their guides as to who got the drug and who got the act of placebo it's a it's it's a it's a challenge to science in many ways and you know I was having a conversation with Mike day who's Mike Jay I'm sorry he's written a lot about this and and he he believes that psychedelics have taught us more about science then science have taught us about psychedelics I'm not sure I agree with him but I see his point that you really see the limitations and you see how limited our understanding of the mind is and that these are complicated chemicals because they're not consistent in their effects yeah and you have a method that's designed to extract meaning out or or a limit variables and how do you limit if you if set and setting are so important how do you assure that every one is only having an experience of the molecule in fact the therapist who gave it to them was given in a chalice or in a cup paper cup all these things are priming the experience and so we have to realize that to the extent that it there the scientific method applies it's a little bit dirty in this case I'm not dirty but you know it's it's it's definitely a challenge to limit the number of variables the way you need to to really test a drug is difficult and in many other and many other aspects too but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it it's it's the best standard or the best system we have for showing the safety and efficacy of a drug before we admit it to modern medicines so it may not be perfect the method we have and it may not be you know exactly right for this substance but it's what we have mmm my concern when so I've done a couple of couple of pieces one for news night BBC Newsnight maybe two years ago was that I still have concerns that there might be too much enthusiasm but at the moment what the journalists have been writing about this and the people have been featuring it are also to a degree psychedelic enthusiasts I mean I certainly was was sold on the idea of it being positive and there's a kind of self-selecting we're selecting people who are already enthusiastic so I do have some concerns that we could we could recreate yeah over sell or recreate some of the kind of over in exuberance of the night I I detect everybody trying to keep a lid on that and the researchers certainly but they feel it you get them out for a drink or beer and like this could be a revolution of mental healthcare yeah and it could be but it might not be and you know the fact is it's it's important to understand that these small trials 15 20 40 you're bound to get better results than you're gonna get in larger trials because you're getting to pick your volunteers and screen out lots of people so you're getting the people most likely to respond you're also the therapists the guides who are involved are very committed to the project they're not people you took off the street and trained and that'll be in the next phase you've got enthusiasts all over the place and so that is encouraging positive results that said the result were so good in some cases that even if they were half as good it would still be better than the leading treatment we have for anxiety and depression so yeah I mean I wasn't a psychedelic enthusiast when I started this the New Yorker article I hadn't had a psychedelic experience I was mystified by the fact that this would work and that that people who were dying could actually reset their feelings about death and overcome their fear of death after a single psychedelic experience this was completely beyond my you know sense of what is possible and but yeah there is a there's an occupational hazard it's it's something about these drugs that people can get irrationally exuberant and so I think your caution is a really important note and we should realize that we're really still at the beginning and there's no you know I can point to people who whose lives have been changed in very positive ways by these medicines but whether it will work with a large population we don't know yet yeah and I guess my other concern would be that if we're looking at it from a strictly medical model the idea that you take this pill and it makes you better well it's not exactly the medical model because it's what's really interesting about this is it's not psychedelic therapy it's psychedelic assisted psychotherapy it's really the joining of talk therapy with chemistry and so anyway to finish your question yeah for some people it can be a very trend you can have a very transformative experience a mystical experience that that is really encouraging but for other people what it can do is bring up an awful lot of suppressed stuff that you don't have to deal with there's sort of two although that can be very therapeutic I mean I've talked to people who got in touch with childhood trauma that they were completely unaware of and work through it so that's why the therapist is so important you bring up things like that and people don't know how to deal with that I mean that's why integration that what happens after your your your session is probably the most important part and if you don't integrate well you could leave people hanging with you no real I mean on with real problems suddenly this came up you know my father abused me where do I go now this really happened did it really happen so it's you know that's part of the being you know treating this process with enormous respect and caution it's really important there's some concern in the psychedelic community at the moment that there are corporate corporates coming in and most of the research so far has been done in the academic model so everything's public everything's published and now corporates are starting to come in and there is a sense of unease and the selected community about that do you share that unease at all yeah I mean it definitely gives me cause for concern I mean I think we're moving to a place where people are trying to lock up intellectual property in a market and I think the academics have to be very careful not to get ripped off and you know one of the attractions to these drugs is they're all public domain or they should be that you're not going to have the usual pharmaceutical model and in fact intellectual property only takes you so far because you really have to figure out a way to create a whole package you know of therapy and drug and integration and the right kind of room all this kind of stuff but this is the way of the world you know on the positive side you could say that it's only when corporations get interested that you can scale this up and reach lots of people and achieve the kind of efficiencies of scale you know so there's that argument can be made you know I'm not sure I mean you know my own inclination is is there a way to do this in a non-profit model I mean I think Maps is doing something interesting with a public benefit corporation as a model but there's going to be a lot of experimentation and no one this is this is not an area that lends itself to monopolies anybody can find these mushrooms anyone can grow these mushrooms so the ideal companies trying to patient psilocybin pathetic suicide venya manufacturing method we'll see if that works it may not work many people have made it before making it at scale is the challenge but still the mushroom still grows and it's available and not hard to find so there's a protection in that there's a you know nature is is defending us against nature it's nature's antitrust act so I guess I mean this does feel as you say like an inflection point an inflection point for the public awareness of this kind of these therapies and within the community as well yeah and there are definitely tensions erupting around the profit mark model versus the non profit model and no I think we're gonna see a lot of change and you know those tensions are a reflection though that there's something worth fighting over there's value here and so you can you can look at it as it's an index to the fact that there's money to be made here there's which is in itself an index to the fact that there might be something of value Michael Pollan thank you very much oh my pleasure yeah great talk
