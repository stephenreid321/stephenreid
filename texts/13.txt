[Music] so close been quite a journey over the last four years or so have you been surprised at the success of Colette yes and no I mean we've worked very hard to get where we are today and so it's kind of the situation where the public sees the tip of the iceberg and the iceberg is all of the hard work and the stress and the problem-solving that has had to go on behind the scenes and we were not successful for a long time we were plugging away doing our thing publishing what we thought were great articles for a long time before many people knew who we were so it hasn't been an overnight success if that makes sense it's been a work in progress as you said it's not been an overnight success what do you think are the key things that have made quill out the success that it is not just the hard work you've done amazing work behind the scenes but what do you think is is a reflection of the culture that has that has enabled Colette to kind of have the resonance that it has I suppose a few cultural events really came to the fore one was James d'amours sacking from Google that was our first real breakthrough article because we asked for scientists to comment on his arguments and to comment on their scientific validity and the for scientists who we spoke to all said that his arguments were quite reasonable and within the bounds of normal scientific discourse and when we published that that was the only piece out of all of the mainstream media coverage of the issue which actually looked at the science and took a measured approach and so popularity increased substantially after that and then there's been a few other cultural episodes that we've responded to and and then there we've also just benefited from a general Network effect where we publish dissident academics so academics whose field of work rubs against the more mainstream narratives either within their field or within the general culture and so once we publish a renegade academic his or her friends will read that work and they'll think oh I want to go and publish with them because they're a friendly space for people with dissenting views so we've benefit benefited from that kind of network effect I can remember the Google memo and there was an article in the Atlantic I think by Connor Frias Dorf saying that he couldn't remember how so many journalists had mischaracterized a document that was freely available to so many people yes and that's just one example in and there are other examples too for just think of a lot of the mainstream coverage of Jordan Peterson a lot of there's a lot of extreme rhetoric you know he's such a nurse he's this and that when all of his content is available to anyone who has an internet connection so I think what happens is mainstream media present a caricature of an individual or Ihnen or an event and regular people in their own homes can just connect to the internet look it up themselves and make their own form their own views and their own opinion and the disconnect that they see between the raw materials or the primary source and the interpretation offered by the mainstream media creates this cognitive dissonance and that that dissonance is something we've been it benefited from because we view ourselves as being a media platform that doesn't engage in these flagrant misrepresentations and what do you think is the nature of that corruption of the mainstream media well I think there's definitely more than one variable at play but from my observations a lot of journalists live in a bubble in the United States so they might be located in a couple of urban centers maybe in New York or San Francisco they have their social circles are collapsed into their professional circles they're all on Twitter so they're immersed in this social professional milieu where they're all trying to impress each other and this feedback loop just becomes very tight and it's hard for reality to sort of penetrate that bubble Qualis has now been called the in-house magazine of the intellectual dark web what does the intellectual dark web as a concept mean to you well it's a broad term but I think it would apply to anyone who's trying to understand the current moment but is simultaneously questioning dominant narratives that are most frequently offered about the current moment something that Colette has done from its inception is question blank slate narratives so blank slate narratives about human nature so this is the idea that we're born as blank slates everything we do or every sociological outcome is determined by culture and so we we've challenged that narrative by looking at things that like biology evolutionary psychology economic factors other than this cultural deterministic model so if you look at something like the gender pay gap through the cult for deterministic model women earn less than men because they're being discriminated against but if you look at it through a a model that takes into account biology psychology and economics you'll see that there are a range of different variables and women are often choosing other priorities in life they might have different preferences for the jobs that they undertake they might prioritize intrinsic motivations over extrinsic motivations such as money so there are a range of other things going on the story is much more complex than simply one of discrimination so we've we've tried to challenge this cultural deterministic model that is very dominant within mainstream media and have you been surprised at all at the way that quill ette has been framed in some circles as kind of outriders for the OLT right and stuff like that not really I think the people who frame us in that way generally don't read our articles and that kind of simplistic framing is just immediately refuted by reading any of our most popular articles that articles are sophisticated and nuanced we don't present simple binary arguments of the oppressor versus the oppressed we're looking at things we're trying to understand reality how it is how it is we're not trying to just present these black and white stories that appeal to preschool children and how would you describe your personal politics well I consider myself to be a centrist I think in the United States I'd probably be on the left because I support things like the minimum wage universal health care I support a welfare net but in Australia I'm probably center-right but we have a welfare net already and a lot of that low-hanging fruit has already been picked and so it's context-specific the thing that puts me up against the left is I reject identity politics and I don't think identity politics is helpful I am a critic of feminism mainstream feminism I'm a critic of things like critical race theory and postmodern discourse and that kind of thing so that that's what puts me up against the left but on a lot of other issues I'm very sympathetic with the leftist worldview and what topics for Colette bring the most kind of heat from critics I suppose anything that we publish on explaining gaps in society with so anything on race would be one any any topic covering any article topic covering race which is a hot-button issue but then there are surprising topics like parenting is a controversial topic people have very different views on parenting styles we published an article on spanking which was very controversial lots of people arguing that spanking is child abuse lots of people arguing that you know it's reasonable in some situations so it's it can be unpredictable what is the most controversial topic you mentioned race obviously Coleman Hughes has been sort of one of your star colonists what do you make of the reaction to his articles well I think his critics don't know what to do with him because he's come out of nowhere he's very young he's extremely talented and he presents his arguments in a very reasonable and measured manner and I think he's his critics so far haven't been able to deconstruct his arguments or dismantle his arguments and they've attacked him on criteria that is irrelevant such as the fact that he's an undergraduate student or that he hasn't cited their favorite scholar in critical race theory so but but he's he's received a lot of positive attention as well as criticism so that's that's good to see because I guess there's a paradox of someone like Coleman because he he has had a huge amount of success with you can argue that a lot of these perspectives are not getting a lot of play in the mainstream media but then someone like Coleman Hughes comes along and he's immediately swept up by an alternative network of media organizations and there's a kind of is there a paradox there that we can say oh well these views are being shut out but then someone like him has become hugely successful at a very young age for this perspective he's bringing why do you think these perspectives are necessarily being shut out but from my point of view I see a lot of low-hanging fruit so there's a lot of perspectives that aren't being explored simply because those who are populating a lot of the elite media institutions aren't covering them so I mean for example there are only so many ways to analyze sociological phenomenon through the lens of race and gender and if someone comes in and has a different analytical framework then they're just offering something fresh and interesting and the problem that I see is that these elite institutions are populated by people who all think the same and who have been educated at the same schools and there's a lack of originality more than anything has any of the criticism been personally hurtful to me to you no I don't think so no I would you say you're pretty thick-skinned yeah I view criticism as a positive thing I would be much more concerned if our wasn't receiving any criticism and I know that you have quite a lot of your audience based in the US yes as as do we I mean we cover some similar topic some rebel wisdom we've had people like Brett Weinstein Eric Weinstein Jordan Pederson on the channel and so it's very easy well it's interesting because we're both based outside the US but we're also exposed to the u.s. conversation in quite a major way how do you avoid I mean I guess we're both aware of like how toxic the conversation can become in the US but with a sort of slight distance to it as well do you think that distance is really important to what you're doing with qualit I think so and and the distance allows one to have a meta perspective so a bigger picture of you I think one of the problems in the u.s. at the moment is that people are focusing on the the small partisan issues that occur from day to day there's a lot of noise and it's hard to get the signal but if you step back and take a bigger picture of you and you look at the cultural trends rather than the little events that are happening every day you can see larger patterns more important patterns and so on Colette we I mean we do sometimes respond to current events but we try to take a bigger picture of you and I think I think it's been successful because there are a lot of people around the world that that like that approach and they're not interested in just the the the partisan squabbles that are happening day in and day out and how do you cover these kind of topics without getting dragged into sort of the culture war of the u.s. well I think where we are a part of the culture war in the US but we're not part of the partisan political war in terms of partisan politics in the u.s. we are non part even the intellectual dark web was was framed as a space for conversation and it seems that the nature of the conversation in the in the u.s. is that everything seems to become polarized almost immediately so even this idea of a space beyond the polarization then becomes a polarizing thing in itself even the attempt to carve out a space beyond the culture war becomes part of the culture war I think that's true but what one has to understand about the United States right now is because they are a very polarized society there's not a lot of trust and so it's difficult for people to have conversations in good faith people are on edge because they feel like what they say might be cherry-picked or misinterpreted and people are searching for secret signs that they're a secret supporter of Trump or a secret white nationalist and so it inhibits people a great deal I think the benefit of being an outsider is that we have less inhibition and from my point of view being an Australian I still live in a society that is not so polarized it's a high trust Society so I know that when I go and talk to friends they're not trying to find me out as a secret supporter of such-and-such cause I can say what I genuinely think without being afraid and I think if we bring bringing that in lack of inhibition and that that earnestness to conversation is beneficial and even though people will try to smear the IDW as you know right-wing or whatever that doesn't mean we can't have these good faced faith discussions within it you were in America for I think you you appeared on the de Bourbon show and a couple of other media media appearances quite recently what really struck you about the American conversation while you were there or the American culture while you were there people get really emotional talking about politics if any political topic enters the conversation you can feel people's blood pressure rising you can get really emotional like either doesn't matter which political persuasion they are part of but I noticed that it this there's such a heightened level of feeling and I feel I feel sorry for my American friends because I think it's really difficult to have meaningful conversations in those conditions yeah I think my my perspective I guess there's a similarity with between the UK and Australia and some differences but there does seem to be perhaps because we've had the BBC for many years as a kind of respected voice in the conversation and media environment is very different from the u.s. it just feels like there's a there is more of a sense of a civil space beyond the polarization in the UK and maybe in Australia as well whereas in the u.s. there doesn't they don't seem to be any spaces for people to meet that are not polar that are not immediately seen as being on one side or the other there's almost no middle ground left I think that's true and I think it's very unfortunate and in Australia we have the ABC which is sometimes considered to be extremely left-wing but it really isn't it's really quite a balanced organisation and they do a pretty good job of presenting diverse views and and so things are a lot calmer and more relaxed here and and we're very lucky to have so far escaped the polarization that has that is afflicting the United States and something I've been very conscious of since starting rebel wisdom especially on YouTube where YouTube is is a very different culture to probably many other places on the internet there's definitely a much more I'd say a more right-wing bias probably on YouTube generally yeah and is is the the phenomenon of audience capture there's this kind of idea out there that if you're if you're self-reliant if you're finding yourself through patreon or through some other kind of crowdfunding site then you're immune from the the biases of the mainstream media but my experience is that it can bring in another form of bias because you learn what your audience wants and a lot of the time especially on YouTube what they want is stuff that is attacking the left or is is is anti the mainstream media because they feel that the so many perspectives are not being represented in the mainstream media yeah how do you feel that sense of or do you feel the danger of audience capturing what you're doing and if so what do you do about it that's an important point I think one thing that we've done at Collette is focus on our guiding principles so we we have a very clear mission to preserve free thought so whatever kind of authoritarian influence is imposing itself on freethought we will try and defend free thinkers and free thought from that so if there's an authoritarian if there's a thorough Aryan ideology and universities for example we will push back against that however if there's some kind of authoritarian movement coming from the right then we will push back against that so we aren't oriented ours around protecting something quite specific and easily definable and that is free thought free thinkers people wanting to explore empirical questions without having their lives destroyed people coming up with original ideas and so that gives us the freedom and the responsibility to be relatively independent and we do I mean we are aware of what our audience likes but we also have to know our audience so our audience will become bored if we present the same arguments over and over again so we need diversity we need a variety and we seek that out as much as we can I mean one of the big questions in this space is where the boundaries are and how where the gatekeeping comes in I think Barry Weiss wrote the article for the New York Times and that was her conclusion was okay it's it's it's a great or it's a positive thing to have a space for heterodox opinions of the intellectual dark web but how do you where are the boundaries where and how do you draw those boundaries yeah so on Colette we draw a boundary around ideas so we we generally have the view that empirical question all empirical questions or scientific questions are legitimate however we don't publish arguments that are not well-formed we don't publish overly emotional histrionic diatribes that are you know written by people who are angry or upset or just bitter so we try and filter out a lot of the the the pieces written when people are in a hot and motional state and we look for the the arguments that are constructed from people from people having a cool level-headed point of view that being said it's difficult it's a difficult space to negotiate we also have to have very strong spines I mean people will attack us if we publish heterodox opinions and arguments about race for example or gender and we have to we have to have strong spines and just say look we are a space with free thought that's our mission and we're going to defend free thought that being said we're not a free-for-all people can't just write something because they're upset or angry and send it in we're not going to publish it we meticulously curate the articles that we publish and one of the criticism that I've seen because that there I have seen quite a few articles more and more and I think you alluded to this earlier in the interview when you said that when one academic is published often other academics will see that and then will approach you but there has become there are quite a lot of articles more recently about people who've fallen foul of who've been excluded because they wouldn't go along with a certain group think yeah is there a danger and I've seen that framed as the Colet is just publishing victims stories of of people is there a danger of being stereotyped as publishing many articles around the same topic like that well these articles that we've published have been quite serious cases where people have had their lives disrupted or in some cases destroyed by social justice mobs and we're not publishing articles about someone experiencing a micro aggression in their university classroom and their day was ruined with publishing articles written in the first person by people who have lost their jobs who have been attacked and hounded on and harassed and we do not feel the need to apologize for that and I would turn it around and ask progressives why this these particular cases of injustice worthy of public consumption well we think they are and I that they're the kept the stories that we've published are important stories to tell and do you have a sense I mean the big question I guess at the moment especially with America and this sort of its sense of increasing polarization is whether the center can hold do you have a sense of whether the center can hold that's an open question we'll see what happens in the 2020 the lead-up to the 2020 elections I my view is that probably not in the short term I think I don't see how the current polarization I don't see any signs that it's de-escalating and I don't think it's just I don't you think it's just Trump or just the Democrats I think there's a lot going on involving technology in social media that we don't currently understand and we're all too close to it at the moment to really to really know what's going on and and the future is is very unpredictable at this point are you are you worried about it yeah I am and I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing with quill at if I weren't worried about it from my perspective I see the the reestablishing of a place where genuine dialogue can take place as an existential question for our culture at the moment do you feel the same way yeah I'm aware that there are thousands of people all over the world who feel like they can't have open meaningful conversations on lots of important topics and I'm trying to create a haven whether these kinds of discussions can occur and I do believe although I am pessimistic about the trajectory of polarization particularly in the United States I am also I do have a lot of faith in the human capacity to solve problems and we've certainly faced larger problems as the species before and have solved them successfully so on the one hand I'm pessimistic on the other hand I'm optimistic that we can solve these problems together why do you think that the conversation is so much more toxic in America compared to elsewhere in the world well I mean it's it's really hard to pinpoint one particular cause or variable and there are a range of different variables impacting the situation and I think it's a very long term it's a what's built it's it's built up over a very long period but I can see that they have a lower level of social trust than other nations and they're the clustering of educated professional white-collar people into these urban centers such as New York San Francisco and other cities has meant that there are generations of middle-class people who have lost all contact with people who live in rural areas or people who work in work and working-class blue-collar professions and I see a lot of upper-middle class a sort of what you would call elites in the urban centers just having very caricatured views of people living in rural areas now don't think that's something we have so much in Australia we don't have this bubble effect where everybody goes off and lives in urban environments I mean we do have that is happening more and more but I think it's happened to a much greater degree in the United States the best book I've read on this topic is coming apart by charles Murray and he charts this process as having occurred you know from as early as the 1960s where people have just clustered into these like-minded communities and they've lost contact with each other and they have lost understanding of each other and what's next for Toilette are you are you interested I mean one thing we're trying to do is to take the discussions that we're having on the channel and try and take them out into the real world and create events for people to discuss these topics is that something how do you take the kind of conversations you're having and take them out into the world well we had our first collect social event in Toronto in January and that was a very fun event and very successful for everybody who came and we'd love to do more events like that in cities around the world but we're so busy right now trying to run the business and scale up that it's just a matter of finding the time but yeah I think I think it's it would be really beneficial for everybody if we can bring these online networks into the face to face real world and help people establish authentic and meaningful connections with one another because another thing that we're dealing with at the moment is loneliness a lot of people are quite lonely and they feel left out of communities that they're involved in either at work or in their social life and bringing like-minded people together can is really can be really beneficial on the individual level particularly for people who who are lonely and I would love to be able to bring that to cities all around the world and that's definitely something that we will hope to do with quill ed into the future [Music] you [Music]
