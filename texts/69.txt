[Music] welcome to the latest rebel wisdom podcast I'm really excited about this one because it's some of the best interviews that we've done recently that we're making live at the same time as we're releasing this I'm going to show some clips from them and there is a theme and the theme is masculinity and I guess the sub theme is it's what about a year now since me too and since a lot of these gender dynamics started becoming really prevalent and really part of the culture and that's been a big theme of a lot of the stuff that we've been doing so what we've got coming up at the same time is two interviews and another round of content probably bout a week after that so we have an interview with Cassie J who directed the red pill film and we've got into Warren Farrell who is often called the father of the men's movement but I think our experience when we met him in America and interviewed him is that he's got a lot more to offer than that sort of characterization he's a therapist he does couples counseling he's deeply interested in how to create healthy relationships and this ultimately I think is the theme of a lot of the content we're putting out is what if if what we're seeing at the moment is tantamount to a kind of dysfunctional relationship between men and women playing out on the wider cultural stage what does a healthy relationship look like kind of linked to what we've been discussing recently around the shadow I think along with that question is what is the shadow of masculinity but then also less discussed what is the shadow of femininity and I was thinking about this but before I think about this a lot actually because the shadow of the masculine that that was the me to movement as well was kind of showing up the shadow of the masculine which is obviously something that needs to happen the shadow of the feminine is harder to pin down I think if you look at it in if you were to take it just as a thought experiment in kind of Taoist terms and you had each opposite implies the other but there really have to be opposite so if you see and they would in kind of Chinese towers and they see the masculine is obvious and it's bright and it's right there so the masculine shadow would be the same it's so clear it's domination it's controlled it's it's sort of its aggressive it's all these things that are quite easy to look at and easy to define absolutely so by by that then the shadow of the feminine should automatically be shrouded mysterious complex and I think that is one of the powerful things about the red pill in the whole phenomena of red pilling is that it lifts a veil on AHA Wade this there's a sense with the red pill I think that a lot of people have watching it I certainly did where I had a sense of were the very water the very cultural water I was swimming in is not what they appear to be I think it I want to interject here because we're two men talking about the female shadow what I want to say and what I think is really interesting about the content we've got coming up because we've got there was a film done by a friend of ours Hannah who did this film called from women to men all about the female shadow and we've got a long interview with her and a long interview with a couple of the other women who appeared in that film about the female shadow and about their ownership of of the ways they've acted out and I think what's interesting as well now is that there is a cultural as I said we're about a year after me too and I think the cultural conversation is now at this point of recognizing we had me to this kind of essential voicing of a lot of suppressed anger or a lot of suppress a lot of boundary setting by women saying no this is not acceptable behavior and where we are now especially with Asia Argento one of the prime movers of the me to movement has the has turned out to be it looks a sexual predator herself who'd paid off an underaged guy that she'd slept with and there was a really interesting article quite recently by Barry Weiss in the New York Times where she said this shows that women are human too which is basically what a lot of people have wanted to hear it's like this this very simplistic dynamic of women as only victims and men as only perpetrators is such a one-sided dynamic and now the cultural conversation seems to have swung to to this this place where we are hopefully allowed to say men have a dark side women have a dark side and it can now be a more balanced conversation and that's what I think really exciting about the content we're putting out because I think we're asking that question and we're also asking especially in the response to the red pill like there's one thing as the film and the the other thing is the cultural response to the film and the incredibly harsh reception that it got from a lot of media platforms especially millennial platforms like Vox and Vice I mean the red pill is a very controversial film and there were quite a few things said about it and it was when we were in America interviewing Warren Farrell and he happens to be a neighbor of Cassie J the the woman who made it and Cassie J still describes herself as a liberal she was a feminist when she went into making the film and I I had a bit of a suspicion as a filmmaker watching it it just seemed so convenient that a self-described feminist would go inside the men's rights movement and have her mind changed by what she found and I have to say I was a little bit suspicious about that I was a little bit suspicious about how how it was a perfect narrative and speaking to Warren and this was unprompted I wasn't kind of we weren't interrogating him about Kathy's journey or anything like that he just volunteered that Cassie had come to him and said I went in I wanted to do something we were an expose on the men's rights activists and even when she interviewed them she had in the back of her mind a lot of feminist talking points and a lot of arguments without the way of saying and it wasn't until she started watching the the rushes back watching the the the film back the footage to make the documentary that she started listening more to what they were saying and understanding what they were saying and came out with an appreciation of wow there are some men's stories that are not being heard there are some struggles that men are having that are not being heard and are not part of the conversation and so she like I have pretty much 100% certainty that her journey was genuine and this was a subtext of an awful lot of the the coverage that the the need that sort of negative coverage of the red pill was people saying well just insinuating it wasn't genuine that it was somehow it was funded by men's rights activists and it was a it was a Trojan horse done by men's rights activists and I don't believe that I think it was a genuine film I think it was a genuine journey and the irony is under a different in a different circumstance she might be looked on as a as a real feminist hero she's a very successful documentary filmmaker I think with a lot of bravery as well she she talks about she did actually lose some some friends when she made the film and she I saw recently she's even been outed or by the Prophet the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a kind of anti extremist organization in America which seems to be an extremist organization itself it had to backtrack it it outed magical or Nawaz recently as an extremist and he is an anti extremist former Islamist that's really fascinating what can be said in the cult from what can't be said in the culture and the fact that a documentary like the red pill which along along with the men's rights activists in it also had a lot of feminist scholars in it as well and you don't have to kind of agree with everything the men's rights activists are saying in it but in terms of a film that adds an interesting perspective I think it's definite it definitely is that that film because why it was really interesting to talk to Cassie yeah just to back to your point about what you said that if I'm not really interesting in a different setting she might be held as a feminist hero I think that's true and I'm just trying to imagine what that setting might be it certainly it certainly seems kind of impossible now with the way feminism has moved at least because it's much more around it is in extra pick inextricably tied to the same postmodern ideologies that a lot of activism is tied to a lot of critical theory is kind of an academia is linked up in with the oppressor oppressed again a name just came up we were talking another very successful woman Clare layman and created the magazine quill let out of her kitchen and it's now one of the sort of most the biggest media success stories of the last couple of years but because quill let is very deliberately anti identity politics and an to the social justice left she is attacked on Twitter rather than celebrated as a as a successful woman the fact that it doesn't really matter even if you the ideology Trump's the personal story pretty much all the time with the identity politics left mmm yeah it does and it's it's also it's an impossible bind and it's also an interesting it it's an interesting indication the reaction to Clayman and Cassie J it for me really points this weirdness that we live in where the the identity politics left in particular has kind of the reigns of what's culturally acceptable and a lot of pop culture power and a lot of media power so they cannot even though they can act as the oppressor they can never admit that their acting is the oppressor because the entire worldview is based and there's only oppressor and oppressed and so when they are always on the side of the underdog yeah and so this makes it impossible for them to look inward of themselves and realize that they now have the power or a lot of power more than perhaps they realize or maybe not realize but want to realize and they're not using it responsibly and this is this the story of the last few years for me I think if you see it echoed everywhere and you see it echoed in the gender discussion as well I think so let's just hear a quick clip from that interview with Cassie I know that it helps a lot of people making this film and and but I don't think it's I don't think we're anywhere near where we need to be and I think the red pill movie was just a very early kind of icebreaker into these conversations but I think we have a long way to go with gender relations and and hopefully eventually finding a healthier relationship between the genders and the other interview that we're really excited about putting out is with Warren Farrell and we've talked before about how if you see culture as a kind of fractal pattern then the the fractal pattern or the patterns that we saw during the late 60s are still here but they've just got bigger and the the gender dynamics that first erupted in the 60s the rise of women's liberation and feminism and this this now to me feels like we're in the same dynamic but we look back and we kind of looked through the wrong end of the telescope we assumed that everyone back in the 60s was part of this movement but the fact that it that we know about it shows that it wasn't universal it was it was an outlier it was a new thing it was we were always attuned to the new and what some interesting about Warren Farrell is that he has been living this dynamic this same dynamic since the 60s a fascinating individual story because he was one of the very first male feminists he was part of the he was on the board of the National Organization for Women in America and he he then at the same time started leading men's groups and in the men's groups he was hearing stories that he realized were not part of the conversation and when he started bringing the experience of the way that men have been hurt and the way that men feel that they have to perform certain gender roles and that they are seen as success he uses the words for example that yes women women are often objectified and seen as sex objects and judged by their looks men feel that they're often judged by success he calls success objects they're judged by their ability to provide they're judged by their wealth they're judged by their status there was a beautiful moment I really I know that we both really enjoyed meeting him and spending time with him there's a really beautiful moment towards the end of the interview where he said men have makeup to male makeup is I am dr. Warren Farrell best-selling author of the boy crisis and what's my makeup I'm doctor best-selling author that's all makeup it's me being afraid of saying I'm also Warren Farrell vulnerable human being in these five or six ways considering he's often framed as the father of the men's movement and the men's movement especially in America has a really bad reputation and perhaps quite rightly I mean I asked him that in the interview whether he agreed that some of the bad press at the men's movement had was deserved and he agreed that it was and I think certainly a lot of the tactics that I see from some of the more extreme men's rights activists in America I can see why they have a bad reputation and it's not I don't think it's doing they're there cause any good they they kind of turn into the thing that they're supposedly fighting against but as I said at the beginning Warren Farrell is someone who's very much focused on what the healthy relationships look like what are the things that need to be expressed from men and from women so that we can have healthy relationships and if we have a culture where men are on one hand encouraged to express their feelings but also on the other hand often the culture will describe it as whining when then do express their feelings there's a kind of double bind and a lot of men feel stuck in that in the moment yeah what really struck me about Warren Farrell aside from him is an individual that I found it's very authentic is his his focus in in the myth of male power his first kind of best selling book it's very nuanced and it's really a balanced perspective of going into the economics and that also dictated the relationship structures we had for a very long time and pointing out that it's not as simple as just saying men were patriarchs and they held women down and just because you know because they're dysfunctional in some way it was it was a lot more complex than that and yes some of that went on of course but it was also a case of men had to go out and be the breadwinners men were expendable as well and then we shifted in the 60s and maybe slightly before to different kind of relationship for the first time ever happening so this is all very new the dynamics are experiencing all really fresh like yeah and so and now we said in the interview really nice thing which was around like we're not designed to be functional we're design in terms of like relationships how we relate to each other's men and women like which is time to be dysfunctional we're designed to survive basically what he says and that you know so we have he says we have an opportunity now where we have a lot more equality to figure out how do we how the hell do we get on with each other in a in a way that is conducive to our health and our children's health as well and I found that was the overriding message I got from him I think is in his work as well is it's really about I find that really useful framing that globally and I think we might have talked about this before what we're seeing is the result of an incredibly dysfunctional relationship it's like the gender dynamics we're seeing on the macro scale feel like the micro scale would be like two parents having a massive argument more like two teenagers having a massive argument I think there's a second part to that interview with Warren Farrell which is going to be a patreon exclusive so if you want to see that become a patron I hope that we are now at a stage where all sides of that debate can be heard because the eruption of Me 2 which was October last year it were it was said quite explicitly at times men now is now is not your time to speak and I can understand that because these are a lot of the time or voices that have heard for a long time and but that it cannot remain that cannot remain as a dynamic by definition a relationship has to be both sides speaking and I think a healthy relationship is where both sides are allowed to speak and I think a healthy cultural dynamic is when something like the red pill is made it is not immediately shut down is it not immediately criticized as I think vice called it you men's men's rights  documentary another thing just came up for me that that he said relating to the kind of that I guess necessary outburst that happens after me to was you know procedure therapist who said obviously the longer someone's held something in the more it comes the more anger is behind it when it finally comes out and now I think was that was very evident there and that makes sense and I wonder now I see that anger as well in the men's rights movement as well and I understand why it's there too I do but the what the next stage looks like for me is a kind of a meeting where the anger has extinguished itself somewhat and maybe we're getting to that point but where the conversation comes it's a conversation about responsibility I think ultimately it's a conversation on both sides around what does it mean to be responsible for yourself and your actions as a human being whether you're a man or woman that's what you do in couple you know in couples counseling you talk from the eye you talk about yourself you talk about you don't you know actually again Warren made a really good point where he said having a dynamic like feminism has at the moment where everything is men's fault I'm being broad with families and I'm talking about maybe the the worst sides of it where everything is men's fault he equates it to a man going to a psychiatrist and sitting down I mean like right okay well I'm here but what you need to know is that everything is my wife's fault the reason I'm Peter is because of her and I've listed out 14 points around where she's a total out and I'm gonna list them out to you and you better agree with me otherwise I'm gonna stop the therapist selection and a similar impossible dynamic where nothing can happen that I still feel is what we're kind of largely in and that's why people are allowed to talk at university that's why Cassie is still as of like today getting slammed in the press and why there's just a lot of mischaracterization all around the place and I think something has to give some kind of humility or humanity has to give in order for that conversation start happening and on that point it might be a good time to talk about Hannah's film yeah so this is one of the most interesting and it's a sort of experimental thing that we've done Hanna produced this film which has gone pretty viral on online called from women to men I am a woman [Music] who has been hurt by men I'm a woman who has hurt men who has hurt men and she's a she's a conflict negotiator that's what she did for many years in some of the world so the most intractable conflict and the thing that she realized is that we cannot move forward until you own our part of whatever dynamic we can't move forward in any in any conflict until we own our side and we own the stuff that we've done and she then went through a process of sending this poem out to many other women and they then came together to make the film and a lot of them would then choose the bits of the poem that really spoke to them the things that they'd done in the past and a lot of them said they went through a real process through doing it as well there's a really controversial piece it's it had really polarized reaction online but it's had about a million views altogether and I've seen a lot of especially men from some of the the men's groups that I've seen online very touched by it a lot of people said it brought them to tears I do mean over time when we all take responsibility for the part each of us plays in this battle when we can truly empower ourselves by owning our parts of the mess and bring an end to the cycle of hurting and blaming I begin today I begin today I begin today I begin today you got a couple of films off the back of that one of which is an interview with Hannah and a couple of the other women who appeared in the film asking why why they've got involved in the project in the first place what they got from it and what the reaction was whether they have any regrets and another film which is slightly more experimental which is and as Hannah said in her in her film what she wanted was to start a new kind of conversation between women women and men and so we try and model that with Hannah her friend Elaine who appears in the film myself and Rath who is a facilitator a therapist who's been working for about 40 years with these issues the male and the female so basically this is an attempt to model this kind of conversation what does a healthy conversation between men and women look like which involves us taking ownership of our staff and then meeting from a place of real ownership and real communication and we'll see if that works yeah well hopefully it kind of has to work I think at some point globally that kind of conversation has to be the norm and in fact again to bring it back to Warren Farrell opus it was a long interview and he said lots of interesting things they're doing it in Denmark they're having their teaching children these types of conversation and that seems the natural thing is that this is a skill that people need to have is to be able to and I think personal responsibility is the beginning of it and I think what's really powerful about Hannah's film or just powerful about just the idea of that kind of conversation is that it starts with personal responsibility and that's where that seems to be what the culture is crying out for at the moment is this kind of a reconnection to personal responsibility and a movement away from everything's about being oppressed or being an oppressor and either being a victim or a perpetrator it's the yeah it seems to me like it that conversation can't really happen within that the environment within an environment based on a press or oppressed I think that just has to go like the broken green we've called it it had it's not a place for that conversation to happen that conversation needs to happen in some kind of new less ideological or post ideological space which hopefully is rising up somewhere or in the ether somewhere at the moment yeah I also want to say about Hannah's Vil that I've had very different reactions to it at different times when I first heard it when she delivered it as a poem in a therapeutic training I was really touched and it was it was a really powerful ownership and then when I've seen it since and I've seen the film sometimes I watched it and I just thought wow this is just it's so countercultural it almost feels too much because on its own it does feel balance it's like well okay but that's kind of the point is that it's almost like a little bomb in that inside that ideology because it's so anti the narrative that we live with all the time for women to pretty much just own their their stuff without any kind of context or balancing of men owning their stuff at the same time so it feels you know what on its own it feels slightly unbalanced but I guess that's the essence of great art in a way great art is not meant to make you feel comfortable it's mostly supposed to make you feel uncomfortable and even I have felt uncomfortable watching that film every now and again and yeah I hope that in the recording that we've put together with raffia there's a certain balance in terms of us owning our stuff and then building more of a complete conversation around it as well as you were as you're describing that that I know that feeling I call it like vicarious discomfort it's like a sense of how something will land in the culture and I feel like some part of me which of course were tribal pea beings now even if even there's a lot within the culture below I disagree with I still feel that twins I've again had a similar experience watching Hannah's film I think the first time it was incredibly emotional you know it's a real - really but a real heartfelt feeling of like relief of like wow okay that feels really just very loving and very responsible like really a really powerful loving feminine energy that it comes with that but also that feeling of like wow this is gonna be dynamite remember that was the that was what I thought first time so I was like wow this is gonna this is definitely gonna ruffle some feathers which it has yes yeah but again feather ruffling is is the point of art I think the point of good art and that's what leads to yeah growth I think it's worth also saying that our interest in these subjects it probably comes from our own histories in terms of a lot of the the kind of the inner work that we've done around masculinity we both teach men's work and ultimately these questions can only be resolved really an embodied it it cannot just become a conversation about masculinity and femininity because then you get into this kind of swampy relativistic suit of or what do you mean by masculine what do you mean by feminine surely we're just humans and then it it all starts to kind of become very relativistic very quickly whereas I know that my experience of doing work or a really connect with myself in my masculine that there's a real embodied presence that I can bring to these questions and then a lot of these kind of gender dynamics resolve themselves very very quickly and if you're watching this new you're interested in this subject we are teaching we've got a men's workshop coming up in November we've got a women's workshop coming up in September at the end of September that is being taught by some amazing facilitators including Hannah actually who did the film and we've got a polarity workshop coming up in January as well I think it's so important to tie this this content the ideas together with the embodied work because otherwise if we just stay up in the heads we just stay up in the conceptual realm and then nothing gets resolved I think it's also important to add none of the workshops about telling anyone what masculinity or femininity is it's really because you can't you each individual has to connect to what that is experientially within themselves and a space like that it's it's a flow state it's getting into a flow state and in a flow state the concepts the ideas they are of like they're not important at all in a sense it's the experience and so experience again is also what really like meeting human to human and communicating human to human that's also absolutely key in developing our own ideas but then also developing ideas collectively and on that now we also have another event coming up which is join the great intellectual awakening and that's going to be on the 18th of September in London we'll put notes down in the show notes with a link to it but again that event it's not just us talking about what's that's run it this is pretty much us trying to create that we've always wanted to create a community around these ideas and this is our first event to try and create that kind of community so we're gonna talk about rebel wisdoms were gonna talk about a history and show some of the clips from some of the films and then trying to create some kind of way of having having these kind of generative dialogues which we've talked about before what does it mean to have a dialogue where you go in genuinely trying from a place of not knowing and inquiring and and finding the answers for yourselves rather than this kind of very ideological way of trying to kind of persuade someone that you're right yeah or what Jordan Greene whole talk about like the old broadcast model or something you know T we cultural be broadcast to you an idea through broadcast to you and we live in a different paradigm now which is the more decentralized kind of knowledge sharing 18th of September if you're in London come along to the great intellectual awakening and one other thing we've got we've recently put up a few pieces on patreon for patrons only we've got another amazing piece with Tim lot who we had an interview with recently talking about the links between Jordan Peterson and Alan Watts and Jordan Pederson has often been described as doing for Western philosophy and Western spirituality what Alan Watts did for Eastern spirituality back in the 50s and 60s and there's really interesting parallels between the two and really interesting differences between the two as well and Tim lot who was the first guy to write a profile of Jordan Peterson for The Spectator magazine in look yeah last year also is an expert on Alan Watts so we had a really interesting dialogue with Tim and that's we're gonna put that live on patreon in the next few days so if you're interested in that or you want to see the second part of the Warren Farrell interview then become a patron thanks for watching and see you next time
