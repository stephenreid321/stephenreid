so we are in CI is the California Institute for integral studies and the reason we're here is that you guys did a really interesting podcast about Peterson and yeah I think we've we've been looking at what Peterson in particular has got to teach the left or progressives because there's a lot of reactivity to Peterson but there's also I think we we all share some sense that there are things that progressives need to learn from Peterson as well and I think you guys did a really good job in your podcast of trying to explain what that was yeah what do you hope to get you've said yes to this interview what do you guys hope to get from it well I think Jesse and I have been trying to find other friends that we can talk to about these issues who don't have a sort of canned response either yay or nay but who were trying to hold that space of inquiry and that's why we recorded our podcast a couple weeks ago because me and Jesse and our other friend Adam Adam Robert we were the three that seemed to be most interested in unpacking what Peterson has to offer and most I think feeling that the left needs a bit of kick in the butt to get things back on track yeah I would say when Adam and Matt invited me to do that podcast we were all someone who similar to the two of you I believe was starting to track Peterson and not just Jordan Peterson what he was saying but also the ripples he was having a culture the absolute phenomenon and explosion of attention that was happening around him in the media and started kind of watching him reading him with an open mind my experience was an open mind like oh I resonate with that I love always bringing in Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and archetypal dimensions to his thinking like how he's kind of kicking the left a little bit and calling them on some of their problematic thinking and then watching this kind of phenomenon from the left or the far left where people just with extraordinary levels of anger and fear and distrust and kind of the the difference in that experience of my own and some of our experiences of Peterson and then watching a lot of friends who are on the far left having radically different experience and perception of who he is and what he's bringing and was really just curious about that and it it seems like similar to some of the stuff you've been doing with rebel wisdom as a I mean your training is a psychologist we do a lot of work with with psychology as well when there's a huge reactivity to something there's always something interesting going on behind it and it sort of makes you inquire it's like okay what is what are people reacting to yes whether you love them or hate them it's like equal proportion of intensity and whenever that's there it's what's kind of called a complex complex is a is a psychological and I think Jung would say it like it can be a autonomous and autonomous complex is it's not part of the ego it's so deep-rooted and it's my opinion it's a collective complex in the collective unconscious it's like everyone on the right thinks everyone on the left is a Stalinist and I real everyone on the right thinks everyone everyone the left thinks everyone the right is a Nazi and there's this polarization happening where people like like Peterson who are trying to carve out I would say not non-political but a kind of a position that's lateral to politics that's more in the psychological domain to ask people to look at themselves as individuals to question the extent to which they're projecting their shadow onto the other which until we can resolve issues on that level it's gonna be very difficult to resolve these political disagreements and so that's one of the main reasons that I've found myself so interested in what Peterson is saying he's shifting the level of the conversation or trying to at least yeah this is this is the key point for me this is why I made because I first found out about him in June last year and already there was a little bit of pushback but I'd kind of delves into the maps of meaning lectures I was like wow this is there's an epic theory of everything in here and I could already tell that people were not seeing that because they were reacting to the political stuff so much that I was like okay there's a lot of people that I whose opinions I really value and people I spend time with who are just completely blocked by the political and I think you put your your finger on it that it's not the right level to criticize him really and I I partly and we kind of also criticized him slightly it's like I wish he would stay away to some degree from the political stuff because I think what he's actually offering is far deeper than that and far more important than being seen through that political lens yeah actually what really struck me when I was listening to your podcast as well was I think I personally very much went the way of so I can restart that so what really struck me when listening to your podcast was its kind of really genuine attempt to identify the walls that have been built up on the Left I kind of find a way to see from within the left how how can you kind of disintegrate those walls walk in the left own and what can it learn I think I very much after reading Wilbur's piece Trump in the first truth world then he talks about there's two different options either the left does that and kind of owns it stuff or we move beyond to something else and I was like I was like I don't think the left can do it I want to move beyond and it was really refreshing to think you know I hang on actually maybe there are ways so that's kind of something I wanted to pose to you guys what what do you think are some of the things that need to happen for those walls to start breaking down hmm well I mean one of my critiques of Peterson is that in a in an age when there's all this resurgent nationalism and white nationalism and the right is in power in this country and in the UK why is Peterson spending so much time worrying about what the left is gonna do and the authoritarianism of the left and I get that on University campuses that is a problem but the universities aren't really holding the levers of power politically the universities don't have the largest military in the history of the world Donald Trump does and so but then I started thinking more well the Left lost to Donald Trump something is deeply wrong if if the Democratic Party who's supposed to be representing the values of the left can't be a reality-tv buffoon right not that Trump is stupid he's a mastermind at the new media environment that we live in and so the reason that I think the left needs to be in dialogue with someone like it arson is because the left is not owning its own shadow and the issue of identity politics is one that I feel is important in some for some reasons there are oppressed populations that need their voice to be heard but I feel like the the Democratic Party has shifted the conversation or tried to entirely in that direction and left the issue of the nature of the economy that we're embedded with them and even Peterson will admit that the end of levels of inequality we're facing are dangerously extreme and it's destabilizing our society and traditionally it's been the left that helps to figure out ways to resolve that and so how do we redistribute that wealth in a way that's not authoritarian and oppressive and top-down that's the kind of question that I think the left needs to be asking and it probably can't happen within the Democratic Party because that's it's a corporate corporately owned party the Republicans and the Democrats in this country both play for the same team as far as I'm concerned I will say I think that's a common question I get if I'm speaking about Jordan Peterson is from these folks in the intellectual dark web is people will say why all this critiquing of the left I can't we see this rise of fascism this values of totalitarianism on the right and that's a really big question is the danger and the threat from the right is so immediate is it not more important to address that and you know critiquing the left could be a more long-term goal and agenda but to your point I heard someone bring us up to Wilbur in a podcast they did recently and he was saying the importance of addressing the dysfunctionality of the left is that we need a strong healthy left to fight back against the extreme and the rising of the far-right without you know with the corrosiveness that you're seeing on both the left and the right you need a strong left like you said like we wouldn't have Trump if there had been more of a cohesive healthy you know democratic or left candidate and party and so what we're seeing and that's one of my struggles in my frustration is the knee-jerk reaction airy response to Trump people can get so focused on Trump and so much emotion gets at play and a part of me is just constantly interested in bringing it back away from the symptom and to the underlying condition it's like what was the soil from which the phenomenon of Trump you know was able to place roots and grow and actualize and materialize there's something that was already there and it has something to do with this radical polarization and unless we on the Left continue to think about it and do some self reflective self inquiry about how did this happen how can we still wrap our heads around this you know Russia collusion all that as well but like how on the Left can we address our part in the exacerbating and accelerating polarization that is quite dangerous and it's what you said earlier about the shadow of the left I mean that was what I kind of put into the glitch in the matrix was and it's my firm conclusion that Trump is kind of a creation of the shadow of liberalism this idea of that the inclusivity that is not actually inclusive there's very sort of subtle we're completely open to everyone and everything from everywhere as long as they think like us and then this subtle judging of especially in America where it's just so polarized there's sort of subtle assumption that everyone who's not on the on the coast is racist and bigoted and even if it's not explicitly said they pick it up you have a media and that is of all things that fueled Trump it seems to me that that fueled Trump this kind of the hidden shadow of liberalism judging others for not being as liberal as then it's sort of the subtle catch-22 tribalism in some way yes and it's dangerous if we don't address it because we have in America these elections and midterm elections in November and then we have obviously 2020 I hear more and more people saying to me holy  like his Trump gonna win get reelected and there's a lot of conversation a part of me is like if the left doesn't get this message doesn't understand its shadow don't worry Hillary's gonna run again it'll work yeah but it's important that's where I feel it's important to speak about the left and the dysfunctionality as well as address Trump seems to sent them even crazier now he's kind of a lightning rod for for the shadow for that kind of anger and it just seems to be driving even further as far looking from the outside yes I mean two years of Trump have been an unmitigated disaster and yet in so many ways he's just a slightly more extreme version of what the American presidency has been for decades militaristic you know pushing other countries around not caring about the poor immigration has been you know we weren't putting kids and cages suffer from their parents as much as Trump was but like isn't one kid in a cage already kind of or 15 like what's the number where it becomes Nazi versus it's just something that Obama did and we'll give him a pass for that mm-hmm so you know all these things that Trump is being blamed for are just slightly more extreme versions of what Obama did what bush did of what Clinton did so why all of a sudden is that everything being blamed blamed on Trump and I will say kind of to a conversation before this war what I think one of the problems in today's world is a lack of capacity to think in complex ways things are so complex it's complex systems right and that's why I think the intellectual dark web is we're talking about is an important space it's a space to allow long-form conversations for people to think out loud and slowly start to tease apart very complex issues and we are in dangerous territory when either on the right or the left we reduce and simplify and get polarized because we stop thinking we stop seeing the complexity and we just say Republicans are this Democrats or this and I think in our culture we need more spaciousness to have these conversations to think together and as you know being someone on the left firmly on the left it's it's unnerving to talk about some of this and start to get react responded to reacted to as if we're being read peeled and going right which is just not happening it's it's an interesting phenomena as we're talking I'm kind of sitting inquiring as to whether there's such a religiosity on the left and the right to be fair and you know that's that's for me where the difficulty comes in going through the political area because as soon as you go into a political realm you're in the polarization almost by definition and it's stuck there and I also find when I have these conversations online with people they go very differently than they do in person yeah and I think that's that's for me is is one of the important things about moving beyond the ideas realm into the embodied human realm because effectively that gives the opportunity for people to meet as humans I've had some vicious horrible conversations online with people that just seem to build on themselves and I meet those same people in real life and it's like hey man I'm sorry let's have a conversation yeah it's true I've experienced that to having sharing meals with conservatives and like maybe initially we're like whoa you believe that and like evolution it's not a thing like and then after a few minutes because we're there with each other in person and we we don't want to dehumanize one another we discover our humanity and our points of convergence and really I don't think the vast majority of of Americans I can't speak for the UK I don't I don't know the society as well but the vast majority of Americans across the political spectrum if they could sit down and break bread together and just talk to one another as human beings would discover how much they have in common I'd also say that I mean I grew up on the left I grew up my parents went to CND marches and sandy was campaign for nuclear disarmament in the UK and so so be part of the Labour Party and I know this for myself that on the Left we have this sort of sense of judging people by their views and it feels like I'm not sure that the same thing is true on the right I mean you see quite a few people commenting I'm far more concerned like I have a mix of left and right views and I'm far more kin turned about talking about my right-wing views with left-wing people than I am my left-wing views with right when people and there is a sense of the left kind of I think either Brett or Eric talked about this that who did you talk to there's a kind of sense of don't talk to someone over there you'll get cooties the left that's insulated and you said religious there is a religiosity of the left that I'm not sure you see quite as much on the right I I think pretty to be honest but a lot of people on the right I'm more used to having conversations with people outside their bubble whereas a lot of people on the Left managed to exist within that bubble I think the political psychologist Jonathan Hite who I've been really enjoying you wrote a book called the righteous mind why and how good people are divided by politics and religion but something he said is that at least in America and again I don't know the UK as well but most you know there's a strong liberal bent for the higher education systems and universities so if you're raised in a liberal environment you learn from the liberal viewpoint then you go to university you learn from more liberal professors and teachers and then you go on this is what happened to me and a lot of my friends so we actually never learned we never really read conservative thinkers or philosophers didn't get the like the more conservative viewpoints while conservatives you know they would learn from conservative thinkers and philosophers or whatnot and then they would go to university or school and they would get exposed to more liberal perspectives so there's an argument that actually conservatives understand liberals better than liberals understand conservatives and that kind of speaks to some of the advantages that they have in interaction and some of that close-minded more echo-chamber on the left and you can see it with Trump and how Trump got elected and how wrong we got that on the left just a radical disconnect from and I think that should be a signal to those on the left that we got we were like our maps were way off like the water we swim in it's like this is because as you were saying before why are we concentrating on the left or whys Peterson concentrating on the left when actually the right have the power and I think my answer to that is that most of us on the Left do not realize the extent to which we have created the cultural answer and actually the pathology of the left is now generally the pathology of the culture and so and I think the response of the right the authorized of authoritarianism is mostly a response to the corruption of that leftist environment and it's very difficult if you grow up on the Left where you kind of you believe that the right is the one that has all the power and that there that you're kind of the underdogs to realize that actually no you're not the underdogs anymore control Hollywood you control most of the media control yes which green I would say the blue church went from being the underdogs to being the mainstream not the counterculture anymore but the main culture a lot of people are resistant to that because they're like no no we're still we're still fighting there's still homophobia the still racism but still we're still the underdogs fighting against this oppressive system and then there's this desire to find more and more oppression even when maybe maybe it's it doesn't exist there's there's two different levels of power culturally the left has been dominant for decades but right at the same time that that ascendancy happened for the left in the cultural domain they're conservatives really took over politics to the extents of you know Reagan and Thatcher in the 80s and it was so bad that like Bill Clinton was running as a Democrat and then that use but he was actually more of a Republican so the Democratic Party has shifted to the right in the last few decades so politically the Conservatives have consolidated power at the federal level but locally in local politics and state politics the Democrats have been losing elections left and right it's the situation is way worse at these more local levels of government than it is in the federal government even right now so there's yeah culturally the left has been ascendant but with mass media and now with this new media landscape over the last I don't know when you want to market Trump is the first president to win because of his because of Twitter because of social media he doesn't need to go through those old channels that frame who he is in a certain way and what was it the day before the election I think the New York Times the paper of record at least until a few years ago was saying that Hillary had a 90% chance of winning yeah most of them had 85% 90% for why the disconnect has become yeah but in this new media environment the left it's a level playing field now but it but that's what's so interesting about you know while we're still thinking we're the underdogs we have to fight against homophobia and oppression there's so much why patriarchy at play which is true you have a lot of other people thinking the same thing like now the you know the ruling power is this liberal bent of rooting out oppression and identity politics so we have to fight that massive wave with our underdog attitude and I was having a conversation with a couple friends over the 4th of July I was on the East Coast for a wedding with some family and some friends and we're talking about 4th of July and my friend was like you know it's crazy looking on Instagram Facebook I'm seeing and this is in the United States obviously they're saying I'm seeing friends at attention you see our friends some of them are just posting like wearing black and like totally boycotting 4th of July it's seen as like such a Republican you know white power you know unconscious privilege celebration of white supremacy colonialism or something a genocide and there's so much truth to that and then my friend was saying but then I'll see other liberal friends you know post you know with an American flag and there's like this disconnect we just had this interesting conversation about how on the Left people can be so uncomfortable claiming any kind of patriotism it's like we've ceded all patriotism to the right and we see it we're reacting to the right who are reacting to us and so they see us is more and more ungrateful and kritis always criticizing what's not good about this how that wasn't right so then they grab more flags and you know sing louder and then we see that and then it polarizes us away but I'm kind of like I feel like I'm nothing we need to reclaim and remember that just the gratitude and the appreciation for this country and the good things and it's it's not in any attempt to dismiss the true genocide the true oppression the true patriarchy and white supremacy and race that does play into this phenomenon that is America but it feels like that's what we split and we give things like authority like loyalty and like sanctity which are three of the five kind of moral taste buds as Jonathan hi talks about it and we just seed it to the right and the just stick with harm and fairness and equality this point you two made about the religiosity of the left yeah the right is obviously religious but they know they're religious the left denies that it's religious so it's this different animal and in some sense it's it's more sinister because there's a split where for the left generally people don't have some traditional form of religious practice or community so politics starts to take on that sort of religious fervor you know so but it's not acknowledged as such and that becomes ripe for all sorts of psychological projection and possession states and a judgment of others who don't agree with you which is a fascinating who was it that said if you if you get rid of God you start believing in anything was it something G K Chesterton maybe like the god-shaped hole that if we as soon as we get rid of religion we find something to replace it and on the left at the moment like diversity equity all of these things which are useful values and this is this is why it's such a complicated thing to unpick it's like it's not that those values are wrong those values are right but if you make them your lodestar if you make them you're kind of as Peterson would say you're your ideal it leads to madness because it cannot be they have to be they're valuable things to include but if you don't make your kind of your archetype or your your ideal individual sovereignty or empowering the end of whatever it might be if you make kind of equity as and we need to have the same number of these people in this positions your end goal the kind of social engineering that you have to get to to achieve that starts becoming insane as I think Eric Weinstein said you cannot build a cosmology on oppression it leads to madness and I think that's true makes me think there are yeah there are very much two layers of the counterculture against the kind of dominance of the let's say maybe the postmodern left in culture so one of them the political response is is not the full resolution I think which is like more the alt-right side sometimes of kind of you know showing it up and being aggressive at it there's another level going on as well which is what David was just talking about which is the the lack of any kind of spiritual meaning I think that's where Peterson's two levels really play out because absolutely crucial to re vivify the world and create meaning and fill that God shaped hole in some way but that is a different level to a counterculture on the political side and for me it's that the lower level you know you talked earlier about what's behind it for me that is the thing driving so much of it so it's I mean to be interesting to hear your guys thoughts on you know you you move in these circles a lot and have a lot of friends who who are you know very passionate about progressive causes do you feel that they can or want to fill back dole shaped hole with something other than political ideology I mean I'll say absolutely and I think I love your point about the left not being aware of its religiosity but I would say absolutely I've grown up and I've been really involved in social justice issues racial justice gender justice involved with philanthropy and activism on a lot of different levels actually and that's how I was raised so I've really been in this space my whole life and this is the first time I've actually been encountering other viewpoints that would be either more Center more conservative and I'm actually really it's feeling really fruitful it's really refreshing it's really stimulating my thinking it's hard to see other people not join me in that and get kind of weirded out what I freaked out by it which then makes me even more intrigued but to your point I and I think this is where kind of Wilberg can come in I think this is where Peterson comes in I think this is where Richard tarnish comes in and CIS is when you have the kind of scientific materialism and you have more of a secular society I experienced the left is generally not always but generally more secular and so that God shaped whole is that when you lose a primal human impulse or that dimension of human experience connected to cosmology mythology meaning making sense making and you know religiosity encounter with the numinous tour the sancti you know sanctity there's problems with that and post modernity is a big part of that that Peterson often rails against but you have I would agree like a deeper guttural intensity with which they would hold on to concepts of social justice around diversity inclusivity and you know equity like justice and it's not that those things are not so important it's just that when there's other things missing there's maybe extra energy and attention and tightness or dogmatic thinking that can come with that you know I mean sociologists would in like after World War Two they talk about what has come to be called the secularization thesis that as technology and the capitalist market spread around the world religion would decline precipitously because people wouldn't need that source of a big dad in the sky to take care of them because their material needs would be met that hasn't happened at all that's that thesis has now been tossed out the window and they talk about post secularity instead in the sociology departments because religion hasn't gone away religion is a more powerful force globally today than it's ever been before and you know Muslims will be scrolling through their Twitter feed before they go pray and it's sort the the idea that technology and connection would eliminate religion is false right exactly and so would you some extra thing that we could shave off and replace but the surrogates for religion I think are often worse than religion so we're in a situation now where liberalism which is part of this whole secularization thesis it's failed and globalization has failed we're not one big happy family you know it wasn't enough that we would all have our own shelf at the supermarket to buy our particular kind of food that we like you know and that we each got to celebrate our own version of Christmas and that attempt to globalize diversity it was like it was as though it was asking everyone you can still like wear your costumes and pray to your pretend God as long as at the end of the day you accept science and capitalism as the true sort of unifier of all people's right and so this whole this whole approach that our governments have been working for like liberalism in a broader sense that even conservatives would adopt as like the liberal marketplace the free exchange of ideas and commerce free trade right there's a reaction to that that's brexit that's Trump being elected here people don't feel like one big happy family and if you believe in climate change or not that's part of the cause of this mass migration that's gonna be worsening like it's just getting started and look at the chaos that's being unleashed this is yeah this is really the interesting the most interesting area for me which is what the rise the Petersons phenomena signifiers it's like and when I saw Peterson last June I was I was like okay this is the message this is the right message for right now so that that kind of rise to fame that he's had since has been of no surprise because if you strip out all of that meaning from society you you create this huge void and Peterson as far as I can tell has one of the most complete understandings of what that void looks like of what the the Jungian idea the the deep archetypes the deep religious truths that we are embedded in and and it's fascinating to see what if this conversation is just getting started I hope that it is I think you mentioned tart Richard honest before he had the most impact on me I think I read passion of the Western mind at university and just thought wow this this guy's really laid out where we're at and where we're going and I think this is a really exciting conversation to get started the Petersons seems to be pulling out I mean he's in debates with Sam Harris at the moment and Sam Harris is kind of like if you want to say avatar he's kind of the avatar for this materialist secular worldview and Peterson is the avatar for this new a real rising religious worldview or spiritual worldview so it's a really fascinating discussion and there that concept right of the the pre trans fallacy so the idea that someone you could have one person over here talking about let's say Christianity and religion and they could be very dogmatic and fundamentalist in their thinking they could be very you know missing a whole lot and some would say okay we're going to dismiss them then you have another person over here maybe more akin to Peterson who's talking about Christianity religion the Christ archetype you name it but they would have moved through like integrated and read and learned about science and about so many other fields and they arrived back in this place around storytelling myth making and religion but from a totally different place but someone standing over here might see them both is the same bit let's toss them both out they're both these loony primitive people have still connected the superstitious mythological thinking but I think Peterson is really holding that of like let's return to religion which you know from the Dalai Lama to call you young people say you know if you're in the West you need to grapple and integrate this judeo-christian worldview in paradigm and how do we reclaim that but from a new level that synthesizes and integrates science and and all these different dimensions and I think that's one of the things I love about Ken Wilber jean gebser the Swiss cook historian cultural historian where they're talking about different stages of development and evolution I know there can be a lot of pushback to Wilber some of these integral models but that's what's really helpful for me and understanding Peterson and making sense of this moment is like there are truths at every stage of development and in each worldview there are different truths they might be partial truths but anytime any stage thinks they have the whole truth that's where there's a problem I think on the left secular liberalism can believe they have the truth because they're all about inclusivity diversity equity now at that world centric pluralistic stage of consciousness that's its primary truth and the other stages don't care about that it's not on their radar even but the second they start getting righteous and thinking everyone needs to and whoever doesn't join us immediately are deplorable and racist a misogynist then they're actually like King from one level but are actually in a very dogmatic primal level that's really no different than other fundamentalists I think that's a it's a key point I think it was in a recent podcast with Wilbur I think that's where it was a the question of are how many of the people who are green in integral terms and the kind of progressive really are or are they amber or red with a progressive cloak on it you know that's a real interesting thing we all have all these levels within us when we get scared or maybe most days we're operating at green but we feel threatened and we regress down to the red or the amber you know so it's not like we're not all of the we all have all these colors within us and the other the other thing that came up when you were speaking is just the importance again of collective shadow work an individual shadow work because if my background is is very much in the in a psychedelic community as well and I helped organize a conference and I think the last two conferences I've given variations on the same talk which called the psychedelic shadow which is hey guys we need to own our shadows because this isn't all about Jamie we'll put it really well there's a status in catharsis and peterson is really bringing catharsis up like down from the depths you know and traditionally communities like the psychedelic community and probably the new agey communities as well and you know progressive communities you know lots of them they tend to go for the ecstasy and the kind of the what's the utopia what's the perfect thing and forget the the dark shadow work and I think that's part of what's happening with the Petersons phenomena as well is that finally it's like finally we get both and they can meet in the middle for me the whole New Age movement was one massive spiritual bypass and it seems like it like in any individual the bypass can only go on for so long before you have to get down and dirty with your shadow yeah in some sense we need to recover the original psychedelic mystery called the Allison Ian mysteries and in ancient Greece where from what we can tell the evidence would suggest that there was a brew called the Chi kyon which was it could have been my surgical forgot fungus that's my hunch that seems to be the leading theory but the the way that they would ritually ingest this was they reenact the myth of Persephone and go into the underworld and experience that cathartic death rebirth experience it wasn't this escapism that a lot of psychedelic culture can now tend towards but we don't have a ritual container that's culturally sanctioned when elders were initiated and using it exactly yeah so my hope is that I feel like psychedelics just went mainstream a couple weeks ago when Michael Pollan published his book how to change your mind my hope is that as these things come back into the culture that it won't be swallowed up by the medical and the medical industrial complex but that the culture at large will find ways of institutionalizing this in a way and in a ritualized way that's not just a sterilized kind of you're sick here's medicine because Pollan Michael Pollan talks about the betterment of well people and that psychedelics need to be it you know included in our culture even if you're not sick all right so I'm hopeful about that and incidentally psychedelics are one place where Sam Harris and Peterson and seemed to meet I haven't seen the two of them talk about that yet but I know they both talk positively about psychedelics as a potential source of individual and maybe collective renewal so that's an area that I'm interested to see get discussed more within the intellectual dark web circles just just briefly you know what's in it just came to me as you're saying that a good model for that is is a good ayahuasca ceremony because it integrates the pre-modern unashamedly it's like we are going about as pre-modern as you can go and we're gonna have a whole bunch of there's a lot of sanctity around the ceremony it's it's you know it has that Ellison Ian mystery quality and you're not allowed to talk about it most places because it's not illegal so it has the you know the secrecy and there's something ritually very powerful about that especially the sanctity because it's what you didn't get perhaps in the 60s is that kind of wild kind of abandoned yeah yeah in the illu scene II and mr. Wright's are interesting because you weren't allowed to talk about what happened in the ceremony and yet they were open to everyone even slaves so radically democratic and radically secret at the same time and by the time of Plato and soccer he's like the mystery had been profaned a little bit the youth of Athens were mixing the Chi ki on themselves and having parties and like wandering the streets causing up havoc but I I will say just to bring it back to that to your point about the shadow and Peterson bringing that right because he's he is often talking about the suffering and malevolence in the world and the malevolence within each of us Carl Jung's concept that the shadow and the most dangerous thing is somebody who hasn't who is not aware of their own shadow or their own malevolence or capacity for evil and that's someone who's radically unintegrated and then you can't really trust them and say you know I I work in the prison system doing men's work it's around emotional intelligence and healing work working with trauma and with men who have you know done profound levels of harm and violence and we talked about that how you can't actually trust somebody who doesn't know their own capacity for that and so I think about the on a cultural level what's happening and I wonder like you know what we talked about the me to move in our feminism or you talk about conversations around race and something I've heard you speak about maybe in that interview or that documentary about Peterson the glitch in the matrix is how when you hear the term masculinity the first thing you think of is toxicity we would never think of toxic feminine and so I'm really interested in reclaiming like empowered healthy integrated forms of masculinity and I think in the conversations on the left it's a slippery slope down into anyone who's straight white and male doesn't have a voice and I'm aware that all four of us as far as I know I don't know if you're straight but we're white men and I'm sure people could look at this conversation and immediately think okay forward men are gonna talk about these issues like I'm not interested or you know I would hope they'd have an open mind to hear what we're saying but in these circles if you try and say something people will be so quick I've seen it firsthand people back cry me a river' like white men you've had all the power to time for you to sit down and shut up and listen there's not much space and any any attempt to speak to that is seen as just fragility or reactionary mansplaining but in the work that I do in the system it's like one of the core concepts is that hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people so for someone who's experienced tremendous oppression violence abuse sexual abuse physical abuse broken homes you know living on the streets they end up hurting people killing people and then they have to do some deep inner work to understand how they got there and a lot of time it's like it's normalizing say when you've been hurt and you don't integrate that you just put that out on to other people you hurt others because you're really wounded and cleaved inside this is a really key and very difficult point because there's this kind of myth on the left of the virtuous oppressed but this assumption that the oppressed must be virtuous and it's it's almost invariably not true and the the why it's so intractable my mum had my mom and my dad had a very interesting divergence on this my they were both sort of left-wing Guardian reading which is kind of the left the left paper in in the UK and my dad kind of maintained a lot of the sort of classic cliched left-wing views up until up until he died pretty much my mum had a very different experience because she was teaching in a school in Southampton a very sort of rundown school and doing her best and what she found was a lot of the parents didn't want their kids to succeed or at least felt very challenged by their kids succeeding because it challenged their own sense of the system stacked against them and so incredibly difficult situation could have been to kind of be trying to kind of help these kids and get them to succeed but when they'd get the parents in some not all I'm sure would would actually either subconsciously or consciously be like well my kid would never go to university universities not for the likes of us and realizing that wow this is so much more difficult because people actually then buy into their own narrative about themselves and narrative about the way the world is and she found that incredibly difficult to deal with but it but it kind of I mean she's she's still very much on the left it didn't sort of radicalize her in that way but she had a much more nuanced understanding about what the difficulty of the situations were and I guess we we work with we'd work with men's work and we work with kind of helping people shift their beliefs and that seems to me the only thing that would work to shift some of these social problems is really deep kind of work in terms of shifting what people's expectations about themselves are their beliefs about their life it's it's a real it's much deeper than the left assumed like if you give people money or you give people more opportunities then they'll take them it's like no people don't believe that they would be able to take these opportunities it's so much more deep a lot of these situations it's internalized oppression it's more complex yeah yeah I mean III I think that's really true and I think it's important to hold that piece because you know patriarchy is a really difficult and complex thing but it's like women I've seen women they cut like patriarchy is a state of mind right it's a sum on some level isn't it about a Liat radical isolation and alienation and disconnection and acting in violent ways to try and get needs met out of a primitive scarce I mean I'm kind of being loose with how I'm talking about it but I've heard I've heard women talk about yeah women can be patriarchal they can be extremely you know violent or aggressive with losing track of the other no relationality a compassionate interaction with the other in workplaces so most of their problems come from other women other women bosses and I think there's been surveys that a lot of women would prefer to have a male Boston a female boss interesting it's not to say that there hasn't been tremendous violence and I think it's important as we have these conversations I'm trying to remember to read to talk about and rename like the reality of men's vicious and violent oppression of women of white people's oppression of people of color the radical inequality and injustice that still exists today and any attempt on the left one of the critiques I heard Jamie wheal talking about what Peterson is like he uses these kind of he calls at biological reductionism but these examples and you know the Pharaohs in Egypt there was inequality of wealth and you know there was you know in nature there's inequality and so this kind of quickness to call out and he do good or aspirations on the Left who are trying to level some playing and bring some equality and to just call that out as you know some sliding slope to genocide too but really named that there is incredible privilege that the four of us have in this room that so many people do not and I'm really interested in how do we learn more about that how do we address that how do we really become allies to women how to really become allies to people of color because there is such real suffering and how do we slow down these conversations and tease it apart and be able to name well right now on the left this conversation is sliding into a way where I feel like as a white man I'm getting completely dismissed and I'm and there's no space for my thoughts on this and then it becomes you know the the perpetrated become the perpetrator or the oppressed it can be oppressor I seen as Weinstein is good on this where he talks about either there's two ways that the social justice narrative plays out some social social justice activists want to reverse the oppression and others want to achieve some form of equality of opportunity at least and he's very for good reason worried about the ones who will reverse the oppression and it's easy when the mob mentality breaks out that that's just you know do you point out the enemy and they are the new you know go to be slaughtered you know because that as you're saying if someone's saying well you cannot speak do not speak that's that's a reverse yeah that's that's that's that's not an equality that's a reverse of this like now we're on top you're you're below and it's like hang on this is surely this isn't the society we're looking to create I saw a conference I was on Facebook and a friend was there and it was in like Joshua Tree and it was a conference and there was all about I think gender reconciliation or women and they had said in the description this will be only for women's because no man is allowed to touch the stage for like three days but men we want men there and to be listening but no men are allowed to touch the stage I mean implied is because men have been the ones on the stage with all the microphones but it just it totally rubbed me the wrong way I'm like you're saying that feels like a total reversal and obviously it doesn't feel good for women or people of color to have been denied access to the microphones in the stage but to then flip it and say we don't want anyone to touch the stage you just listen to us it doesn't seem you wants enough for helpful yeah it's not a particularly empowered place to come from either it's the victim perpetrator cycle and then also just makes me think of something I learned in kindergarten which is two wrongs don't make a right and it's just very very simply boils down to something like that I just wanted to pick up on one thing I fit I felt some discomfort when you were talking about the patriarchy as in that men were oppressing women through history I mean we thought about this a lot it's like what what is the patriarchy so there's obviously some sense of us all cutting ourselves off from a sort of direct form of knowing we've got this kind of very rational male way of looking at the world but I I'm not because I I think men have often sort of see it have generally seen themselves as providers they've seen themselves they've shut themselves off from a part of themselves to go out to work there's a disposability of men like all of these things seem to be true at the same time like I don't and I think there's a danger of it getting into a conspiracy theory version of the patriarchy when we just see it as as one one yeah one sec suppressing another and I I think it's really interesting that's why I think the term patriarchy is so difficult to kind of to use because people have different opinions always and I do think that it that it obscures the disposability of men it obscures that the fact that men pretty much self sacrificed themselves to go out and work in some pretty horrific it if you're not the patriarchy patriarchy kind of sucks even if you're a man no if you're not the eldest son who inherits all the land if you're one of the little brothers patriarchy it kind of sucks thanks for pretty much everyone yeah it's true I appreciate that pushback I think it's for me that discomfort I have is trying to find this point of like pushing back on the unhealthy way we use words like patriarchy then also wanting to like remind myself I guess of my own privileged ways if I walk down the street if I go for a job interview there may be certain privileges that just support me and the way they don't support other people and so it's trying to like name you know some of the injustice and that the real brokenness of some of the systems trying to support folks who are at the bottom how to rise up but I also hear you saying you know it's a good point that it's problematic to simplify and say just men against women just white people and folks of color black people it's problematic to simplify and it's holding that subtlety of there are these forces there are these things that kind of undeniable as soon as it becomes an ideology as soon as it becomes a kind of fixed idea then we're then we're in trouble it's like hold holding I return to the point you were talking about before I think that the the sign of a mature mine is being able to hold things that are equally true but contradictory at the same time and it's a difficult thing to do because I think I think this may be links into the fact that we use language we assign concepts to things and we are kind of as Vic and Stein talked about with bewitched by language we automatically gravitate to a sing your understanding of everything rather than being able to hold the fact that many things are true at the same yeah and I mean we've we've done a lot of hating on the intellect internationality but Ralph Waldo Emerson said once thinking is the hardest task in the world thinking is the hardest task in the world and I find whenever I tend to get emotional in a political discussion I kind of regress into an ideological complex and I speak from a position that's not really mine I'm sort of it's the position that I've been steeped to believe is the good one and I'm not thinking anymore and so as much as we might want to critique hyper rationality and materialism and scientific reductionism and everything whatever we're moving into is not going to be irrational right you know it's gonna integrate the mind and the intellect and everything we value in our capacity to think and the intellectual darkweb so much of what it's allowing back into the culture is this slowing down this opening up of a space of possibility to think through the options and to say yeah we have values that are deeply emotionally rude that we want to protect and and speak to but how do we you know we could share the same values but have different ways of operationalizing them realizing them in the world and we could learn a lot from one another about how to operationalize like even if we all think the quality about of opportunity is a great thing how do we achieve that the left might have a very different way of doing it than the right maybe we need to beta-test a bit and work with each other to see what works from each side and then you know assemble that into something that can deal with the complexities of the world that we're living in hmm so yeah just a little plug for thinking yeah want to bring back to something you said before about the father archetype because I think that there's a big picture I think that speaks to the charge at Peterson is bringing more than anything else and possibly speaks to a deeper resolution of what he's bringing as well because I think I really feel that what he's bringing is this is this kind of structure this father archetype but a lot of the the deep history of Western culture probably up until and including the 60s because Young is a big part of it as well like it he's he's channeling this deep story of Western culture and by definition there is a big sort of patriarchal element to that to that story and I think there probably is a deeper resolution of if he's if he's bringing back the divine masculine and I think we have lost a lot of the divine masculine in in the last 30 years there is a sort of well anything goes do whatever you want which doesn't actually speak we need structure we need discipline we need self responsibility and this is that his body's bringing back but I do think that he there is probably a deeper resolution to the energy that he's bringing and that is the feminine as well there is some sort of divine feminine energy that needs to be brought back and what if the crisis that we're seeing at the moment is and I believe it is a kind of male crisis of having shut ourselves off from intuition having shut ourselves off from sort of more direct ways of knowing it's the ultra rationalist materialist secular paradigm of rationality that seems to be breaking down and which which is a very exciting time if if if there's a chance for something new to be born from it and I know that Ritter tarnis in particular was talked about this as a as a kind of shift in consciousness that's likely to happen when he kind of gave some predictions for it's kind of it's kind of it feels like this is the time that the tarnis and other people have been talking about probably since the 60s that this rationality space is going to break down and then something new will need to be born and I think part of that is reopening to the direct intuitive feminine for want of a better word ways of knowing I mean this this touches on a number of things one is right men also suffer under a patriarchy this mental Mentalist intellectual disenchanted world view of alienation and isolation that that's the endless hunger that drives us to you know try and control violently and and and take all for ourselves but also we're talking about jean gebser and like the the breakdown between stages and levels of consciousness and the end of this mental stage and into this next but I think it's absolutely true we're trying to find as a culture what's healthy masculine what's the healthy father energy what's healthy feminine what's healthy mother or female energy or the mother energy and I I was reading this article by Michael Aaron caimans and he was saying how Peterson is this lightning rod because he's carrying this father you know massive energy but it's he was saying that young saw it in the 50s or the 60s I guess the 50s when the Catholic Church officially made it Catholic doctrine the assumption of the Virgin Mary and he said that's it that's finally the realizing of the feminine of the Divine Feminine it kind of institutionally being recognized he also saw the emergence of World War one and World War two is Wootton or Dionysus energy this repressed kind of feminine chaos Dionysian archetypal energy that God who'd been repressed for thousands of years under Christianity emerging but it was also chaotic and violent how emerged but then through the 60s and up until now the last hundred years starting in the 30s I guess it's been this reassertion of the Divine Feminine or the mother energy but that somehow it might also be slippery and turning into that devouring mother more pathological and so it's this kind of awkward thing where especially as men if we're trying to say oh now it's the devouring mother and calling out that the unhealthy pathological aspect there's no term of toxic femininity yet but of course how weird is it that there's toxic masculinity but there's no toxic femininity now yeah young is an interesting figure in this sense he's certainly the wise old man but all of the analysts most of the analysts around him were women you know Tony Wolfe and Marilla Levon France and so he's catalyzing this sense of empowerment of the women around him and the assumption of Mary was something he pointed to was that Lisa the beginning of the rise of the feminine and he critiqued Christianity and the Trinity in particular for having these three dudes at the seat of power of the universe and he thought that 3 is an unstable number we need the quarter natee and the fourth he identified with the feminine and that our culture is our judeo-christian culture in the West is seeking some more stable psychological orientation that was the feeling function the feeling function exactly and there's one issue I want to it's a bone I want to been wanting to pick with Peterson for a while which is this very literalist identification of in mythology of the feminine with chaos in the masculine order I'm not um you know mythology expert or anything but if you think about Athena or any Queen archetype these aren't chaotic goddesses and on the on the male side if you think of Dionysus you mentioned the trickster like there are plenty of examples of male deities and female deities that break that easy identification of masculine with order and feminine with chaos just wanted to point that out it's interesting about I was literally thinking about that point right before you said it and it's maybe another way to see it was I'm thinking as soon as you said Yong Yong was a big fan of the Gnostics who I'm a big fan of and there is in their mythos there is a sense of the feminine not as chaos so much as undifferentiated and then they have they have Sofia and Cristo and Christos the role Christos plays is similar to the role of the Green Man in Celtic mythology it's kind of puts every species in its niche and creates order in the not chaos so much as the undifferentiated and that for me is part of what's going on with Peterson and just with the you know the the shift away from postmodern hyper relativism is that the natural response to that is to play some order in it and to put things in to their niches so to speak and part of that is hierarchy as part of that is breaking things down and saying okay we need to accept this and this from biology we need to look at this and this and it's still ongoing that's the thing so it is user work chaotic it's still a bit chaotic because these are very complex things and I feel like it's the yeah it's two things coming together but hopefully it gets to somewhere where there's a deeper resolution sacred marriage I mean that's how that's how Richard harness talks about it in the epilogue the passion of the Western mind is that you know clearly the masculine rational consciousness has been driving the Western ego and Western culture to this point and all the while alienating itself from the feminine mm-hm and we just can't continue moving forward in that way for so many reasons culturally ecologically often the earth or Gaia's identified as the feminine and you know some feminists have a problem with that and I get that but there's a need to reintegrate the human being especially in its in its hyper masculine eyes d'huez turn form with the broader community of life on this planet and if if that's not the need for a sacred marriage like I don't know what it is and the crisis that we're facing right now is I don't know what whether to call it one crisis or multiple crises it's a meta crisis that is social political economic ecological gender-based racial but it's all part it's the diesels they seem like symptoms of some wonder lying archetypal what's going on so you're point about some deep you know I don't know what to call it spiritual religious meaning based problem I mean well obviously you know Wilbur would say you know or Deb's sir we're moving beyond and through in a natural it's important sometimes Peterson feels reactionary I post modernity and all this stuff scientific materialism is a prolly huge mistake and we need to kind of go backwards I'm not going to be saying we have to go backwards but it's a mistake as opposed to Wilbur he says no that's a natural stage it's like a adolescent child you know you go through you're right but we can't we have to go through it there's no way out but through and so how do we reclaim a profound relatedness and relationality to the cosmos to the planet to each other to the divine you know when you talk about the meta-crisis it's like fractally showing up in every field in every way you
