[Music] if much of the conversation in the media looks like a dysfunctional relationship between men and women Warren Farrell has a unique perspective he was the most high-profile male feminist back in the 70s helping women's voices be heard then started running men's groups and hearing men's stories as well he wrote a series of books and became known as the father of the men's movement now he teaches couples counseling to help both men and women listen to each other stories I'd love to hear you kind of summarize where you came from I think you've got a really interesting perspective having been part of the women's movement and and then you're you're now kind of seen as the father of the men's movement yes it's ironic I start yeah and I did start out when I was doing my doctorate at New York University the women's I was teaching at Rutgers University at the time and when the women's movement surfaced I started incorporating that into my political science curriculum as a political movement and my advisors and I was also doing my doctoral dissertation at the time and so the students and at Rutgers were saying man when you speak about the women's movement you got fire in your belly and yeah you should think you know what are you doing your dissertation on and I said what I was doing it on which was a different part of politics and they said you should think about doing it and something about the women's movement so I went to my to my Advisory Committee and they said oh you know Warren you don't want to sort of like demean yourself with taking on some little fad that's going to be going away in a few years and I said I don't think this is a fair that's going to be going away I think this is a an evolutionary shift where women are beginning to speak up and say the old gender roles of the past were too rigid we're more than just a role and I think that this is going to have implications for both women and men however I do agree that it's a lot of hostility toward men and you know and it may take a little bit longer to catch on among men and so they said if you really want to go for it that got me deeply involved and then that led to my being to the board of directors of the National Organization for Women in New York City and then I got reelected for a few years after that and so I spoke all around the world on women's issues the importance of women's issues and why any secure man should be a supporter of women being having more flexible roles and and also the importance of this for men and for men to be a part of this process you'll now known as the father of the men's movement but in in the States at least the mr1 known as the m-ras men's rights activists have a pretty terrible reputation do you think that any of that is deserved or not yeah I think somebody's deserved I think some of it has been strategic you know Paul Elam who sort of started voice for men he was he read the myth of male power of a book I wrote and and he said my god this is you know this is something that everybody needs to be aware of and then but he started but ten years passed and you know the book had some impact but it didn't change the cultural dialogue about men and women and he said well you know what's what's wrong with Warren Farrell's myth of male power approach and he basically said this is what he's told me directly and he said that what's wrong with it is that he's so rational and so thoughtful and he doesn't really he doesn't get anybody to notice him in sort of a and doesn't get pressed with the press needs that you know Warren Farrell does not understand is they need to be you know you need to bang them you need to be outrageous you need to be in a way stupid and you know and then the press will pay attention so he began doing that Nepal ulam is a counselor so he's not like you know completely dead to the world man in terms of sensitivity and so he but he strategically said you know I'll get the attention of the press and he did do that and he got the attention of the press he was right and but in the process of doing things like reversing roles and saying here's a you know here's what women say about men I'll write an article and just say the opposite of that and I'm could make women into the person that is accused of being ridiculous in one way or the other and and then the press was outright outraged then but he also drew in some people with that method that were quite anger angry and hurt and so my I don't agree with many of the things that were said however I do understand his strategy and I also take a very different approach to people who are angry my attitude toward people who are angry or what we call people are filled with hate is to listen to them not argue with them and people's hatred quotient is significantly reduced by being heard and so the very first thing you need to do to to to help give good therapy to anyone who you call a hater is to not yourself be a hater of the haters when you're a hater of the haters you are a hater also and so if your if your job is to be progressive if you consider yourself a progressive the first thing we need to do with every hater every person we disagree with vehemently every person who has gotten bitter and angry is to hear them out to find out every piece of the puzzle that has contributed to their worldview picture and when we let them know that we've not only heard what they said but we say this is what I hear you say is that accurate and we keep working on it until we get an accurate vision of that and that person can say my god you will see tears I have seen when I do that with people see you know when you hear angry dads talking about the legal system and how oppressive it is just change the topic ask them about their kids ask them about what what's hurting inside of them that they can't see their kids and out of the person who's whose eyes you felt anger and steel coming out of you will soon see tears coming out of those eyes and and the hurt and the pain that led to that anger and that's what we need to be focusing on and when we do that and when people are listening to that way they don't become the shooters they don't become the haters so let's be that as progressive as we claim to be and let's listen to those that we disagree with vehement Lee rather than to put them down and just give them a label that allows us to discount everything they feel and everything they say the label is our statement of our being regressive not progressive so from the outside one of the criticisms by the men's rights activists is that feminism now has has become very angry and blaming men and it but it seems that they're basically just reversing that dynamic rather than it it's almost like they've become a mirror image of what they're protesting again yes the the enemy often becomes very much like the person they're fighting and when we fight the enemy we often become very much like the enemy and that's a problem and I disagree with a lot of you know the anger I'm just I don't myself tend to be an angry person and so so that part I you know I agree with that type of critique and the rash but to help us understand the rationale you know Paul Elam was saying things like you know Warren's rational logical thoughtful approach was not accomplishing anything the feminist movement was generated with a huge amount of anger toward men calling them the oppressors calling men you know people who were responsible for a patriarchal society that made rules to benefit men at the expense of women this was a lot of anger and that my former wife tried to get me to not be involved with the feminist movement at the beginning because she said it was filled with man haters and I said I it's important for us to find the best aspect of feminism and to promote that and the best aspect of feminism was expanding options for women and making the world much making making and allowing women to be a lot more of themselves and they they were in the old days of roles and so and now I ask us to do the same thing with with men yes there's anger what when you're a father who's devoted to your children and you have the that children that you get a divorce and you have the children ripped away from you and you see the children being over protected and not going doing well in school and having ADHD and having significant problems you get angry and when you try to fight that and explain to the courts and the judges and you use a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to fight that court battle and you lose everything you have and you have to put your home on mortgage and and you and the judge is still not understanding what what is needed for the children and the and your your your program to have lots of psychologists evaluate you and expert witnesses you're paying for lawyers you're paying for and you're paying for your wife's lawyer as well you get angry and so so I'd like us to have compassion for what generates the anger rather than rather than say they're angry they're MRA Warren you don't want to be associated with them no I don't take that position but I want us to hear the people who are angry at us whether they be feminists or whether they be men's issues people when I was first interviewed by Barbara Walters for the Today Show years ago when I was on the board of now she said how can you associate yourself with people like Kate Millett she's bisexual and my response was we have to maybe because Kate Mallette is bisexual maybe she can see the forest through our through the trees she can see what we as heterosexuals don't see because she has a broader view of it and we have to we have to hear the people that are different from with what we have what we have in most of the world today is divided perspectives that are that they have that are take comfort in their niche and do not hear the people that differ from them it's interesting to hear that Paul e Lama has that's a very definite and deliberate strategy on his balance yes do you think it could work I think it works to a certain degree it works in the same way that feminism works that feminists used that type of strategy well they have many strategies going at the same time they had the anger strategy which was represented by the red stockings and many of the Socialist Worker party feminists and then they had the the now strategy the National Organization for women's strategy which was much more male friendly and male inclusive and and you know let's let's change laws and make some constructive changes in society so then they had the university strategies of educating people and so they had multiple strategies working and one of the reasons they could get so many strategies working in such large numbers so quickly is because we're biologically programmed to protect women we are not biologically programmed to protect men so the the big difference between women and men is when men say we have this problem it feels to most people like men whining and women are not attracted to whining men they're attracted to alpha men and when women hear men whining it is often like nails on a chalkboard just that the the sound sounds awful when a woman complains and says she's hurt and she has a problem we are all we're all competing to rescue her I was one of the competent competitors to rescue her I was the world's biggest male feminist da you're you have something to say I will hear you I will be sensitive to you I was the biggest shock in the sensitivity group if you will and so if I can mock myself but it wasn't out of trying to be the biggest shock at least in a conscious level it was me it was that I did hear what women were saying my mother you know told me when I we know Greg went to graduate school she said I wish I had gone to college rather than focus on making enough money to get closed to attract a husband I really shipped myself by not going to Cornell where I got a scholarship and my mother moved into depression and I saw that and was sensitive to our depression so when the women's move in surfaced and and and articulated the importance of women getting education and being able to do what they wanted to do making full use of their talents that was there for me on a gut visceral level to be able to support because you mentioned the sort of how culture and women particularly see men complaining there's and whining that's really interesting because on one level we have a narrative that says men need to be much more in touch with their emotional side they need to be much more men lock things down and that's really bad and women often complaining about that and then on the other side when men do saying how they're feeling they're often described as whining or complaining and there's there's a little compassion for it this is exactly accurate and this is that this is one of the challenges that we need to really confront is that that we say men speak up share your feelings it's like Lois Lane and Superman Lois Lane wanted and begged Superman to cry but she has zero interest in hearing about anything from Clark Kent women do want to hear men's feelings and hurts and pains if they're assured first that they're Superman that they're the protector but when they meet Clark Kent and he's more open about his feelings at his pain this just turns the women off and women don't understand this about themselves they think that oh you know my husband really cried when his own when his mother was dying of cancer I really supported that so doesn't that mean I support a man expressing his feelings the answer is yes and no you ears you're supportive of a man expressing his feelings what he's when he has empathy for someone else's pain you're not often support or look more introspectively about whether you are open to a man expressing his feelings of anger or hurt or upset about something that you did but when you experience it as a criticism from your husband from your boyfriend oftentimes your boyfriend experiences you as backing off as being less willing to be sexual less willing to be emotionally open being more distant from him after that he needs your love he wants your love when he expresses what hurts him and gives him pain and he sees that you back off he tends to repress it because everybody else as well as you in the society has encouraged him to back off from expressing his weakness speaking mostly broadly what were your feelings when he first saw the me2 moment a arrived and how do you think it's it's gone and developed since I was I was very happy women were speaking up and then as it began and I was I was shocked at the things that Weinstein and Matt Lauer and you know some of the men did I mean just to me it made you know like if it was it was eye-opening and so I'm very you know happy to hear about that and and happy to sort of get the discussion started that you know men you know your penis is not something that women enjoy seeing we pay billions of dollars to take women's clothes off but we put men and men who take their clothes off without being given permission first they're put in jail and so yes that's a double standard but let's face it you got to be aware of this double standard you know nobody would arrest a woman who just took you know who took her top down a little bit and began to expose a little bit of nipple and we would just sort of be salivating for more but when a man does that with his penis you know that's the end of the game for that man and so you've got to know enough about the world to know that and sorry if it's unfair but you can't make it fair by your power secondly understand that there's a double standard happening out there if a woman is if a man has spent his entire life like Matt Weinstein you know climbing the ladder and making the sacrifices that he made to to sponsor the pictures he sponsored and probably working 70 80 hours a week so he gets overweight and looks like a you know a terrible example of a man the that that he begins to see lots and lots of women competing to have access to him lots and lots of men competing to have access to him and and he has certain feelings about the women who and what he wants oftentimes his sexuality and sex and he feels like he has earned his way to that and so but only by the women who are going to compete for that and so he has and so should he use his power in that way absolutely not is he a jerk absolutely yes absolutely is he more than a jerk like an a-hole yes he is but at the same time there's another side to that story which is the competition for access and the very fact that a woman through her sexuality could have access to a man for whom thousands of people are competing to have access is something that women have to look at about who are they playing into that many many women Marilyn Monroe used to say this about herself I'll have sex with anybody in order to be to move higher into higher up the ladder of having more of a career opportunities and so a heterosexual male does not have that opportunity with Matt Weinstein and and their or any heterosexual producer so let's look at all sides of this issue including Matt including the the hashtag me to decide for a long time at the beginning of me to the part of the narrative was and this was kind of explicitly said quite a lot of the time men now is not your time to speak and now is your time to listen which and there's some there's some truth in that it's like there's a lot of stories that haven't been heard before that the women are finally feeling empowered to speak and it's a valuable thing to do but it seems to me that you can't stay there because by definition it's not a relationship if only one side of the relationship is is allowed to speak we have to realize that the male-female evolutionary dance has evolved as a tango for millions of years and it's very important that women speak up about what they do and don't like about their parts of the tango and that we recognize that there are thousands of different women from different backgrounds who have different answers to that question that women don't just have one message to deliver on that issue at the same time all the exact opposite is also true it is not true that we haven't listened to women we haven't listened to women speak the feminist message for more than a half century but we haven't listened to men express their feelings ever at all that was exactly the opposite of what masculine was about so let's open up and hear boys and men's stories but what do we need to do we need to know how to listen and so after almost a half century of doing work sharing helping men understand women and women understand men and doing role reversal dates and men's beauty contests because I said to every man in my audience every woman is in a beauty contest every day of her life if you want to understand the beauty contest of everyday life come up here on stage and be in the beauty contest of everyday life that women go through and when men went through in my audiences those deputy contests of everyday life they really did increase their empathy for what it was like to be paid attention to for your beauty and not paid attention to for your mind conversely when the women were asked to risk the sexual rejection that men experienced by but I often say there's more than about a hundred risks of sexual rejection that a man can typically take between eye contact and intercourse and I asked women just to take a couple of those risks like asking a guy out and kissing him on the cheek before you know during a 20-minute simulated date and women who were executives just started shaking and sweating when they had to take the risk of asking and men out especially when I encouraged them to ask out the man that they were truly most attracted to which was usually the man that won the beauty contest and so you had eight or nine women competing for the man that won the beauty contest and and those women started exaggerating what you know what they had to offer you know I caught I have a Porsche I'll take you out to a really nice place at a really nice restaurant well this woman was a student she could didn't have a Porsche and didn't have much money to take him out but she started acting like what she valued about herself I started acting like a jerk and in my entire life she would say the only time I ever used the word jerk was to talk about a man now within 20 minutes of the simulated exercise that you asked us to do I'm starting to be act like a jerk that's the type of thing that we need to listen to but I found after many years of doing this around the country in the world that this did help men and women have a greater empathy toward each other but I was still missing something when men and women were married or in a long-term relation ship and they got into an argument and a man criticized the woman or the woman criticized the man both sexes tended to become defensive when they were criticized and when they became defensive that made the other sexes scared to speak up again about what they that they heard so I started developing couples communication workshops in those couples communication workshops I taught people how to do a workaround to our biologically natural propensity to become defensive when we heard personal criticism from somebody we looked and so that is a very hard thing to get people to do because you're working against the natural biological propensity to be defensive but over a ten hour workshop over the course of the weekend I can train people to be able to listen in a way that makes it self that makes it safe for they themselves to hear the criticism because they can see that providing a safe environment for their partner's criticism actually makes their partner feel more heard and therefore feel more loved by them and therefore love them more so they begin to make a different connection a connection of being criticized to an opportunity to deepen love that is the work that we need to do in this world that is the work that we need to do in this world to help men and women hear each other help Republicans and Democrats Israelis and Arabs to help everyone that disagrees with each other to hear each other first but to become internally safe not this is not active listening alone active listening provides a safe environment for the person who's speaking and criticizing to speak up that's good but what we also want to do is to provide a safe internal experience for the person being criticized to understand that as they hear the critique of themselves they will feel either more loved from a loved one or more respected from a colleague or safer with somebody within a different ideological perspective that is the next evolutionary development that we need to pioneer and how on earth do we do that on a sort of cultural level we do that first of all by recognizing that it's that but by speaking up I hope that by saying this exactly what I just said in the boy crisis I will begin to start forming a cultural dialogue it's by spending time with people like yourself who have done good work who are not here to trick me into saying something that they can get a little sound bite out of and sensing who those people are that want to move us to the next evolutionary level spending time with them spending time with people who are wanting to use it for their own purposes but maybe beginning to soften the edges of those people and so it's it's a lot of work and a lot of the work is going to be done in very small numbers at first but sometimes that those numbers can begin to reach tipping points where it becomes safer and safer to speak up about these issues because it's also very true at the moment we talked about what can be said and what can't be said there is a cultural ideology at the moment that is allowing certain types of conversations and not allowing other types of conversation yes and and those that cultural ideology that allows certain conversations and not other conversations is an ideology that is possessed by people who call themselves progressive I'm I have always thought of myself as politically liberal and progressive I totally a pour the word progressive being used to keep other people shut down progressive in my opinion only allows for people to speak up and it never allows for some statement like your mansplaining it allows for a statement like you're a man and you're explaining sharemore you're making progress by just sharing your feelings to begin with we've always encouraged men to share their feelings and then never really allowed them to share their feelings we're being part of the problem if we call you a man's plainer we're being part of the problem if we say we do we don't want free speech on campus for people who don't want free speech on campuses the fact that the Liberals are now or people who call themselves progressive are now trying to prevent certain people with different ideologies from speaking on campus is the exact opposite of progressive it is regressive and I refuse to be part of that part of quote progressivism which is really a regressive ism so we've been putting out films about masculinity conversations about gender between especially between myself and Louise Mazzanti and one of the themes because we work we do teach men's work as well and part of that men's work is about emotional emotional intelligence sort of increasing men's emotional intelligence being honest and there's always a hard core of kind of mgtow type guys who post under it and say this is feminized language you guys are closeted feminists talking about emotions talking about feelings and it seems it seems like there's a there's a real online subculture that sees any kind of talk around men's feelings as being a closeted kind of plot by feminists to take over yes that is as wrong as it can be the what McTell and other people should every men's issues activist should be encouraging ourselves to be able to act to encourage boys and men to access their feelings it is when when boys get depressed and they get ready to commit suicide it is almost always because they have not had access to their feelings because they have not gotten had been gathered together in groups with other boys who are then sharing what's going on behind their masks and be every boy every girl or two has a mask and and when boys when girls have masks they oftentimes talk with other girls and they discover that the mask is one thing and the girl is another thing and they and they can talk with their mothers about that well the boys have masks they fear that they're the only one that they're lonely that they're the that that they are they have ADHD and they can't get it together to really do their homework well or they wanted to join the basketball team but they can't rehearse effectively and and so on and so they feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with them and then they get together in groups of eight or nine other boys and the other boys six or seven of them was saying yes I have the same feeling and others are saying I don't have that feeling but you know I've been taking drugs or I've been cutting myself or I've been you know I've been masturbating and I feel terrible about that because my parents are Catholic at me and they feel that that's a really terrible thing to do and somebody else is saying well gee I don't I don't have that response from the Catholic parents but I have it this way and when boys are sharing that they their the the the Albatross psychological albatross that has lifted off their backs is enormous and so it is just a fundamental mistake to be to to to not encourage boys to open up and express their feelings their hurts in their pains but there is also I think I understand some of the point because if you share that within a narrative of men are faulty men are emotionally shut down and there's not respect for men's vulnerability or it can be used against them in this culture that it can be a it can be a sort of subtle power play you're encouraged you're encouraged to be vulnerable but a vulnerability isn't necessarily respected correct and that's the same type of thing that women experience in the opposite mode fifty years ago if they wanted to be a surgeon people would say well why don't you just you know get married and you know and maybe be a teacher if you really so bright and so we discourage girls from being their whole cells because we wanted them to conform to being feminine that's a that's dangerous just like encouraging boys to try to not share your feelings because you don't want that to be used against you we need to be encouraging boys to be whole people and yes it will be used against you and yes find the women and men in your society that it could be that want the real you not a fake you I don't want to be married to somebody that makes me keep my mask on or doesn't make me keep my mask on but I choose to keep my mask on in order to get her approval in love that is not approval that is that's approval but it's not love and so we want boys to be loved boys have been trained to be invulnerable in order to be disposable and we've been trained to take the concussions on the way to the touchdown and to be cheered with not just by girls and the cheerleaders but also by the fathers who say that's my son that got that touchdown who do what I call son dropping dropping the names of their son to say I'm the parent that raised that boy that got the touchdown without any consciousness of the boys the other brother that is standing next to the father watching his brother score that touchdown is being ignored because he wasn't willing to risk his life and get a concussion to score a touchdown we need to this is this is the next growth work of men and as as I mentioned before it is not just an initiation process initiation processes are excellent but and an initiation processes help boys to move from you are being cared for by a parent to now is your time to be to be the one that's accountable the one that's responsible the one that's the one that has to do more than just be served you're the one that also serves that's the positive function of an initiation process but that initiation process cannot exist effectively when it's independent of an entire lifetime of being brought up to serve and be responsible and be accountable as well as to be to be served at times and to have your own feelings be able to be heard I watched the red pill film and thought it was really interesting it was it's it's subtitle of feminist goes inside the men's rights activist movement and as you see in the film she changes her her mind about some of the things that she is but I also had a kind of suspicion that it's a very good narrative and as a documentary maker I kind of thought how much of that was actually authentic did she really was she really a a feminist or is it it's quite convenient that she changed their mind but you what was your experience of her when when you met her and did you see that journey yourself I have had the advantage of seeing Cassie from feminist days and feminist initial interviews where she would use words like patriarchy and dominate and stuff like that that all revealed since they came out of her so naturally combined with the fact that her last two films were very liberal this all revealed an honesty about her being a genuine liberal and a genuine feminist and so and I could see her you know listen with the pretense of an open mind but then we and then I saw the the challenges that she went through we happen to live near each other so when she and she shared with me and I shared in the film I believe to the fact that the first time she when she listened to us she pretended to listen and absorb and not be filled with objections but her mind was coming up with feminist answers to our questions and the discounting of what we were saying and it was only when she went over the transcripts of every single interview she did of 40 people that she realized that we were not saying what she was having her mind say that we were saying that we were saying things that were very different and that there was almost nothing that she could disagree with and so she began to play our message by her feminist friends thinking my goodness I really heard something different and this is really an important part of what needs to be a doddle dialogue not a monologue and and she did that and then she started getting scared because almost all of her feminist friends were just completely unwilling to hear any of it and this shocked her because she assumed as a feminist that our friends were open-minded and this is exactly the same process I went through and see he came to me and said I'm a fear afraid is it true that said that these women are not listening that are they gonna unbecoming are they good am I going to lose my financing am I gonna lose my reputation I'm gonna be the devil like you are and and I said yes and she went whoa that was not the I expected assurance not that answer and I said but he will also be known for your integrity you'll also be free to do and say and and do films in the future that are your that come from where you what you discover not what other people who financed you want you to discover and you'll become a free agent and that's what happened for me I became free to say what I to do the research on the boy crisis that led me to understand that boys do so much work worse when they don't have a significant amount of father involvement and just to say that and then to document 70 different ways that that was true and and not be fearful that I shouldn't say this but I can say this and how could I say that and how can I twist it and turn it to be a good boy to mommy and it was like I was freed to be my own agent and that's what Cassie has freed herself to do by moving to the next level and I said yeah you have to make the decision you'll either be you know you'll be well financed and comfortable or you will be go through some shit Theo's challenges but you will also create new allies and people who have deep respect for what you're doing and I think when it comes to gender issues the red pill is by far the most courageous documentary that has ever been created even the name the red pill has been associated with a lot of misogyny and online kind of anti women sentiment do you think that's fair or not there is some you know in some of the reddit places and other places there is speaking out against women that has gone way beyond what I'm comfortable with and I also as somebody who listens to people couples all the time exaggerate what is the challenge that they find in their partner when people exaggerate and overdo their exaggeration they usually have not been heard and once they've been heard that exaggeration diminishes you know and one of the one of the mindsets that I ask couples to do in a workshop is to imagine a stream and the anger that your partner has is like pollution in that stream and what we have when people don't get listened to whether it's Men's Rights people or red pill people is we have a huge amount of anger and the solution is being the filter that allows them to share what their hurt and their pain is and then watch and be it anticipate a much greater purity and beauty and wonderful water on the other side of that a filter of your attitudes really changed and in respect to feminism well my attitudes have not changed in respect to gender roles I don't consider myself a feminist and I don't consider myself a men's liberationist or a men's rights movement person I consider myself an advocate of gender liberation and I want both sexes to be liberated from rigid roles of the past and to be open to more flexible roles for the future and so my my desire is I do support the expansion of men's and boys consciousness and expansion of our concern for what's happening for Ben's and men and boys because I feel that like for the last half-century we've been putting our binoculars on women's experience we've put our binoculars on women's experience of powerlessness and women's experience of men's power we haven't had our binoculars at all on men's experience of powerlessness and men's experience of female power when a fourteen-year-old boy considers begins to feel his testosterone and his desire for sexuality and he sees a cheerleader in his junior high school class cheering and he begins to have feelings and desires for her he knows that she is most likely to be attracted to the football team members and not him and so he fears that if he doesn't get on that football team the chances of him having any type of connection with her is minimal and so he feels enormous ly powerless toward every female to whom he's attracted if he's a heterosexual boy and and so that is an example of the female experience of the male experience of powerlessness visa vie girls and women but it's only one of many examples and so the and so there's been no credence given to that experience of powerlessness and we fundamentally misunderstood the whole idea of male privilege and male power it one of the experiences that I do in my in my workshops is to ask everybody in my audience to think about what they're what created the glint in their father's eye and so I put everyone through a sort of guided imagery of thinking about did your father have a glint in his eye when he was writing poetry when he was an artist when he was fishing when he played golf and when he was let's say a when if you're a little bit older maybe when he was playing with your children and you noticed that he was playing with your children he had a type of freedom that was not encumbered by his need to tell you what to do or to criticize you you know and so everybody eventually comes up with a glint in their dad's eye or if they don't didn't know their dad their imagination of what created the glint of their dad's eye and so after I do that experience I then ask them to imagine consider what created the glint in your dad's eye versus what your dad actually did for a living and which one of those two things would have been likely to make more money would he have been likely to make more money writing poetry or singing or in a choir in the church or you know doing something like that or did it was he more likely to make more the consistent consistent dependable money as an accountant as an engineer or whatever he did and so that's and most people you know come up with the the the belief and understanding that their father gave up the glint in his eye to do what he felt he had to do to earn the type of money that the family needed to support itself so dad's gave up the glint in their eye to create a new glint in their eye and the new glint was you as a child being successful you as a child having more opportunities privileges and an options that he had so let's look at that the father played his role which was to sacrifice the glint in his eye to be able to help you have more of a better life to be able to be on the protest line and the feminist movement let's say and so and now you're calling that male privilege and male power as if it was a part of the role of an oppressor in fact that was the discrimination against your dad was the discrimination that said it's your role because you're a male to earn more money so your dad went out and did things that were less of less fulfilling he drove a cab he drove an uber he drove he did he worked in a coal mine he worked as a firefighter as a police officer he went into the military so he could have stable dependable income so you could have more options and now you're turning that against him and saying that he had male privilege and he had male power you have no compassion understanding of the male role and what was the expectation on him and you know if we said to the two mothers you are the oppressors because you was stayed at home and took care of the children and had all that love a connection and the man had to go out and work in the coal mine you oppressed him and made him do that we would have no understanding of of the fact that the mother was pressured into raising children and the dad was pressured into raising money those were two roles that we that we depended upon for survival let's be compassionate to the the let's let's get on our knees and thank our mothers and fathers for the sacrifices that they made to be able to free us to think beyond just making sacrifices and so that's where the feminist movement should be that what the feminist movement movement has evolved into is a dichotomous movement dichotomous movement in which it says there are oppressors and oppressed that type of thinking grew out of Marxist feminism in which there was these statement that the people who were the the upper the bourgeoisie they're there they are the oppressors and they and they and then there's the oppressed and before that the civil rights movement where there truly was the oppressors and the oppressed and and so from that oppressor oppressed model the feminist movement developed which was a completely in a very appropriate model for civil rights and a very inaccurate model for men and women in which we were all in the same family boat which our mothers and fathers were both making sacrifices in the hopes that our lives would be better than their lives were and we have completely missed the male contribution to our fathers and grandfathers helping to make our lives so privileged that we can sit here and talk about these things in ways our fathers and grandfathers were never privileged to do this is very interesting because I speak to some there's this concept of the patriarchy yes and I speak to some women who who have a much more nuanced understanding on one side you have a sort of almost conspiracy theory type idea of the patriarchy it's men oppressing women throughout history hoarding all of the money and the power but you I do speak to a lot of other women and have a much more nuanced understanding of it and saying well no the patriarchy is a system that forces both men and women into roles that they don't they they don't that don't fulfill them and that don't speak to their deepest needs it sounds like you're you're coming from that same perspective if you want to define it that way I'm disagreeing with both perspectives okay I'll take one at a time so let's go in almost every Gender Studies course the number one one of gender studies 101 advocates that we've lived in a world dominated by a patriarchy in which men made the rules to benefit men at the expense of women there's virtually no gender studies teacher at a major university that would disagree with that and I say that's completely inaccurate what is that more accurate from my perspective is that we've lived in a world that's dominated by the need to survive and and in that attempt to survive most cultures developed roles that were different for a minute for women women risk their lives in childbirth and and made sacrifices to raise their children effectively men risk their lives raising money and risk their lives in war to protect the children that the women bore and so both sexes made different types of sacrifices and so because that was what was necessary for survival and so that the dominating force was not patriarchy but survival I disagree with the second premise because it is because it is not appropriate I don't believe to call it a patriarchy that forced both sexes into roles that would be as as mistaken as calling it matriarchy that forced both sexes into roles in fact in most nations mothers care more that their children get married and that's stayin to strict roles that there's that there's their women in many respects and in many cultures are more conservative more attached to roles than the men are and so but it really doesn't make any difference which which cultures have which percentage of men and women that are attached to roles what is true is that using the word patriarchy to say that that patriarchy hurt both sexes is as misleading as using the word matriarchy because it sort of tends to blame men as or it would blame women if we said a matriarch a force both sexes into both roles and so I'd like to say rather than using the word patriarchy or matriarchy it was survival needs and does it the desire to survive that led most cultures to figure out what roles men and women could play to help the next generation to survive and thrive to a greater degree so we're leading men's work and I found it really really since I started sort of going to a men's group a few years ago I found it a really positive thing oh really it's really helped and we talked about vitamin M that in some sense we're all as men craving that that contact with other men a real honest communication that real Brotherhood do you do you think it's really important that that men have that kind of level of support and connection with other men yeah absolutely it's a the moment that men get together and talk and share what's going on in their lives is they do something revolutionary which is when they're talking about their real feelings and their real experiences of life they are they are taking themselves out of an isolation pit which is what every man was trained to be experiencing and they they open up and they're they're freer to see themselves in relation to their peers they realize that friendships are not based on keeping themselves to themselves and drinking instead and taking drugs instead you know men you know die from drugs and from alcohol and from car act you know reckless driving far more than women do we commit suicide far more than women do and when one looks in the boy crisis book at the at the 60-plus the red flags of depression you realize clearly that men Express to experience depression more than women do but we just never measured it in a male friendly way and so the psychological problems are much more the province and mental health problems are much more the problems of men and masculinity men were never designed to be healthy we were designed to be heroes héroes is preparation for a short life health intelligence is preparation for a long life that's the future of masculinity if it is not to be self harm as masculinity but it is to be emotionally intelligent and women are not going to want women in the future will not women in the future who are earning income will not want men who are just earning income they will want men who have emotional intelligence as well as success intelligence and so we have to if we want to be loved by women we have to develop the type of emotional intelligence that women will seek when they are successful economically I guess implicit in what you're saying is that men are encouraged to wear masks and to perform and to to be okay to be strong and what you get from a men's group is that you're you all you can all take off the mask together and the irony is that I find that women really want men who are authentic they don't really want men who are performing and they can kind of they want men who are who have strong bonds with other men and they want men who are in touch with themselves yes I know many women are alike which i think about I just said it I'm gonna go Superman and Lois Lane yes right okay let me start that again yes and no it depends on the woman many women are like Lois Lane they have no interest in Clark Kent but they have a lot of interest in Superman and once they find their Superman and they feel protected and they feel secure they want a man who can express feelings but that's within the framework of feeling secure by a man's protection first the problem is that the qualities it takes to succeed at work and the qualities it takes to succeed in performing are in tension with their almost inversely related to the qualities it takes to succeed in love so for example when you're when you're in the military and you are afraid of losing your life in battle you have to disconnect from your feelings in order to do what you have to do and so you cannot say gee I really value myself and the fact that I'm Jewish and I'm being called you know all sorts of negative anti-semitic names I should just seal that off and not say anything about it because you know I have to take it you know military people and men in general were trained to do what they had to perform well not just in the military where it's really clear but also of the Japanese have a word called Karoshi it is means death at the desk or death from overwork as an executive and Karoshi is is an understanding by the Japanese society that the men who are expected to perform in an economic type of way as an executive that the feminists say are that may have male privilege of male power but in fact it doesn't have they don't have male privilege of male power they have a male expectation to be willing to die says supply money to their family and so that a woman will marry them because he's a salary man who earns a lot of money and he then learns to value himself only because he earns a lot of money the corrosion of the Japanese have moved so far beyond that that one of the most popular games in Japan is a game called Karoshi and the people who win at the game of Karoshi they climb up the ladder before somebody else climbed up the economic ladder to get to the wall that they never maybe even wanted to so you get higher on and the winner of the game Karoshi offs himself that is commits suicide not in real life but in the game so the uncommon wisdom of many japanese youth is that the process that we've taught men to earn money to make more power or have more status is is actually a form of encouraging men to commit suicide and the and so therefore many boys who are growing up are saying if I don't want to follow my father's footsteps of climbing this ladder that with no choice about what I'm doing and I don't want to join the military and possibly die so what do I do how do I have purpose where do i channel it and that's where an entirely different dialogue needs to happen and women need to be part of the dialogue about healthy masculinity because a lot of us males are heterosexuals a lot of us males want women's love and women have the power that has not been acknowledged at all in this culture if women said I will only fall in love with I will only marry I will only have sex with men who walk on their hands we would be having hand walking contest starting tomorrow and after a month or two we would be competing to make sure that we can walk on one hand because Lea walking on two hands is common so I can walk on one hand seatmate and so as long as we have that type of need for female approval we need to recognize that being ourselves is not just functional for ourselves it's also functional for heterosexual love and women have to look at themselves and say do I really I want a yearning for a man who's authentic but if I'm falling in love with in the framework of men who are performers I'm going to be encouraging the men to perform and not be authentic and that's a responsibility I have to take and make sure I don't just fall in love within the framework of performers I'll give one very powerful story I think on that issue and this is a challenge for this is a challenge for almost every woman and a including very powerful and secure women as a rule like Gloria Steinem I remember going to a show that Alan Alda was going to be hosting in New York City eight years ago and with Gloria and we cab driver picked us up this is before over and a few decades before over and and the and Gloria was saying to me while we were waiting for the cab become you know how hard it is to find really good men and that men that are thinking that are thoughtful that are you know that are sensitive and so on we get into the cab and the cab driver recognizes Gloria especially after she says where we're going to a TV show and and and he starts and so Gloria's very it's a very gracious woman and says you know well what are you and you know involved with and he goes well you know I driving a cab now but I have a master's degree in anthropology and she says oh really and so he we had a wonderful discussion about different cultures and so on and the guy was very thoughtful and insightful and and you know and then Gloria Gloria and I get out of the cab and I said I said well there's a good man meaning just the opposite of what she had said about those men not being available and and then I looked at her I said do you see him as a possible candidate for your love and she's sort of like gulped and registered the point but the conversation ended there and what I am saying about that is that when a man is driving a cab or doesn't have the success that we want him to have in performance mode we often are as invisible to his better qualities as men are to a less attractive woman's better qualities born you've been leading men's groups since the 1970s what do men get from men's groups and how important is to is it for men to have those kind of relationships men get themselves from men's groups they learn in men's groups how to be human beings not just human doings they learn how the process of becoming a human doing often forces them to wear a mask that that shadows themselves as human beings even to themselves and to their children they learn that at the end of life almost no man says I wish I'd spent more time at the office I wish I spent more time in the battleground but says I wish I'd spent more time with my family I wish I was there for that recital I wish I was there to just have a family dinner nights more often where I could talk through with my son and my daughter what's going on in their life where I could really listen to them draw them out and give them maybe a little bit of pusher shove in a different area that's out of their comfort zone I wish I could take them camping more often I wish I could roughhouse with them more often I wish I could read stories to them at bedtime more often these are the things that men yearn for we work so hard because we want our families loved but then when we dip them when we oftentimes feel criticized and complained about and and disconnected from our families love we feel or we work very hard to become a great lawyer and we learn as a result of becoming a great lawyer that we are really good at listening for a criticism that we can give our oppose opposing lawyer and then when we listen to the criticism we can give our wives that the process that worked to make us a great lawyer made it us a terrible husband and a terrible father and so these are the types of things we discover by talking about our common experiences in a men's group because a lot of people listening to that would say well why can't men get that from a conversation with their wives a conversation and intimate relationship one of the reasons why it's hard for men to get that in the conversation with their wife is because they're they feel whether it's accurate or not they feel that their wife married them in part because they were successful in part because they when the going got tough they would stand up and get going but they didn't that their wife did not marry them because they felt like they want instead of becoming a medical doctor they said gee I don't want to become a medical doctor you know what I'd like to be I'd like to be an artist I may not be the best artists in the world but I'd like to at least try my creativity and develop that and by the way that's gonna take maybe five years of art school and maybe thirty years or twenty years of trying to sell my art but and most most women who married the doctor the lawyer or the executive they're not interested in that real feeling of what the boy or the boy becoming a man really wants to do that's what the men feel and if women really do feel that way about a man they need to make sure that they share responsibilities that they share sponsibility for asking the man out that they share responsibility for calling him up that when they go to dinner that they don't expect that he'll pay more than half the bill or pay the bill more than half the time that these are the little signs that men pick up about are you interested in me for who I am or do I have to pay the bill to be worthy of your company and if he has to pay a bill to be worthy of your company that means he's learning the lesson that to be worthy of your company he has to be successful therefore he has to wear the mask of success and therefore you're not interested in him taking off that mask and saying I don't want to pay for dinners more than half the time I don't want to pick you up I don't I don't want to buy your drinks any more than you buy my drinks I don't want to buy you a diamond when you don't buy me a diamond I want to really be as a partner together and I want to I want to be able to be free to earn less money and to perform less so I can be more fulfilled doing what I really want to do I want to be able to when the children are born to say who will take care of the children full-time part-time not assume that you'll have the choice and I'll have to go along with whatever your choice is these are all the things that are not being discussed in society at this moment that must be discussed that can come out in men's groups that men can realize that they're not alone and they're thinking about these things and then be able to articulate them to both their wives but before we articulated these things to our wives we have to articulate these things to ourselves and there's no safer space to do that in a men's group because there's no fear of being judged by a woman in a men's group let me say one more thing about that and this is because not because we don't want women it is because we want women so much that we have become over dependent upon women's approval and that ironically unmake sus the man that the woman wants it is not quite a catch-22 I think it's a type of insight that is a type of new male wisdom which is why I called the game Karoshi that the Japanese play boys uncommon wisdom and we have to learn just like a woman had to learn in the 60s that becoming the type of woman that a man wanted her to be having a certain waist and a certain size and looking a certain way and putting makeup on over herself that that the makeup was was making up the gap between the power she had and the power she wanted to have and that was putting on a false face well men have makeup to male makeup is I am dr. Warren Farrell best-selling author of the boy crisis and what's my makeup I'm doctor best-selling author that's all makeup it's me being afraid of saying I'm also Warren Farrell vulnerable human being in these five or six ways and this is I guess the the paradox that's quite difficult to understand from the outside but I know it to be true in the men's work that we're doing that the work that I'm doing with other men is about being grounded in myself to then meet women from a much more empowered place yes like that's that's a cart that I guess is a catch-22 that by going more deeply into our my own masculinity I can then meet women much more grounded because I don't need anything from them I'm not in fear of them I've resourced myself elsewhere that's a paradox I guess it's a paradox but it's also we have to respect women enough to know that so when I was dating I was single for 21 years before between my first and my second marriage to the woman I've been involved with for the last 24 years and the HOS now my wife and and during that period of dating I often I made it very clear to women that I would not be picking up the check no and I never asked a woman out I discussed whether we had enough interest in each other to pursue something further and then I asked her if she said yes as I said well you know where do we want to go from here with this and the woman we usually say well let's go out together and so I'd help incorporate her as a partner in the decision to continue our relationship at dinner together and then I would say and I had the advantage of her knowing what I did but there were some women that one a woman was a president of a local now I will not reveal who or where and she was out with me and when it came to dinner and the end she expected that I would pick up the check even though she was a now president and and I said explain to her that I didn't believe in picking up the check I believed in sharing or I fight about picking up the check this time and that I liked Terra that we could pick up the she could pick up the next check and or she could cook a meal for me and so and she started to cry and and then she got so embarrassed at herself and to her credit she said I am so embarrassed Here I am the president of a now chapter and I am upset because I feel like I really like you and if you don't pick up the check there's a part of me that believes that if a man doesn't pick up the check it's because he doesn't like me or respect me and I'm afraid of that and so I had enormous respect for her for crying and revealing on what she said but what I found and this is where I'm going with this what I found is that when I shared why I didn't want to pick up the check more than half the time why I didn't want to put myself in a position where I could not make enough money to be able to share say what I needed to say in the world because I was paying out a lot of money toward supporting women then I would that women looked at me and they said they saw on the one hand like gee most men who wouldn't pay more than at least half or more wouldn't pay for dinner for me they must not like me or there must be cheapskates I saw a different experience for most women but not all women which was he has enough courage to say what almost no other man has enough courage to say and said they saw the strength behind that most women did but other women some of whom I was very attracted to and some of whom I would felt I would be able to be sexual with that evening if we had completed this dinner process I had to get up all the courage I could to realize that I was probably going to forfeit being emotionally and sexually involved that evening if I said something like that and so it is and so first of all we need to submit in the long run I found a woman who was responsive to that who was there up to who I was very attractive to attracted to and yet she did respond to that to the courage and didn't have a need to be paid for all the time even though she had never been paid she had never had to pay a single penny on any date in her entire life up until that point she was able to reverse her paradigm because I was strong enough in my apéro dime and so I'm asking men via the support of members Roop's to be able to be strong enough in their paradigm shift to be able to share that with women with compassion and to be able to hear the woman that maybe can't hear you first time around and to explain with love as you're listening also to her what you what you feel and you what you believe in or on fire thank you very much it's been a pleasure the second part of this interview was Warren Farrell is available exclusively for patrons through our patreon site we used to have a battle of the sexes that's been historical but now we no longer have a battle of the sexes we have a war in which only one side has shown up and to turn these words into action rebel wisdom is running our own workshops for men
