I hate both phrases toxic masculinity and toxic femininity and you know the piece that I wrote for Colette I think was called on toxic femininity to to make the point right up front you know before I got into it in the piece that this that this was going to be that conversation or at least a very small part of it actually there's a lot more to say about it which is that and I guess I would also there's a lot more to be said and I would want to really separate out over in toxic masculinity space the stuff that a subset of men do that is actually toxic to use this sport that is problematic is also problematic word now and the things that men are more likely to do and that some people don't like it but but deal with it right so you know being more likely to maybe interrupt in a conversation being more likely to take risks this is a more masculine way of being on average and I don't poison us in school boisterous is also medicated out the boys right very much so so that's a whole other conversation but absolutely the fact that the schools are designed for girl ways of learning the schools mostly are not designed for boy ways of learning and so boys get slapped and corralled and told to sit in straight rows and look forward at the teacher and take nice notes what they're probably closer to illegible handwriting than the girls have that's not doing boys any any any good so you know the actual toxic male behavior so I would say that you know most men on average will display some of the stuff that most men tell you will are more like to be boisterous than most women and all of this but but aggressing you know being violent aggressing pushing oh in the sexual sphere this is what toxic masculinity should mean right like this this is what that should refer to so if that's true then over in the toxic femininity sphere what what kinds of things are on average when more likely to do but this is just a more feminine a more female way of being they're more likely to to be in groups same-sex groups and talk as opposed to do like men are more likely to get together and do and women are more likely to get together and talk I think on average and maybe they're doing something at the same time you know some some kind of craft or or eating together and men are more like like go out and play game or build something or fix a car and that's you know very stereotypical but it's also true so in that talking there is the building of relationship and there is also the building of kind of storytelling some of which is true and some of which isn't and so people will complain about sort of women tending to be gossipy the way that will complain about men not sharing their feelings and I would say those are sort of equivalent in terms of like this it's just like actually somewhat stereotypical feminine or masculine ways of being and there we are like we can continue to talk about it but toxic no right by comparison so men are on average bigger and stronger and so when they go toxic when they go off the rails they are more likely to go physical and society-wide it is easier to point out and to make rules against physical violence and so toxic masculinity actual like violence is relatively easy to call out and you know what the me2 movement could have been was a empowering of people to actually call out real harassment and worse when it happens me too went off the rails when it could have done good in part because of what actually can be toxic in women the same way men can go violent few of them do but it's bad women are much less likely to go physically violent or an average smaller and not as strong of course we're not as likely to have used physical violence as our and right men are more likely to have used physical violence as their weapon when they went violent women are much more likely to use wiles and sexuality because especially for young women that is where their power is and young women have such vast power over basically every other demographic at least in American culture in in some cultures and you know in the Far East where elders are respected more this is not this is not going to be the same kind of dynamic but in a culture that has a tremendous amount of freedom to express yourself and your identity how you want to anyone who is any young woman who is at all close to the beauty norms for her culture and that is it's probably less true than it used to be but it used to be most women from you know I don't know the ages of fifteen to thirty something like that and you know our diet and Big Pharma and such of messed with that to some degree but most young women have had the revelation sort of whether it's waking up one day or emerging over several months of I now have a way of moving around in the world and of controlling people that I never had before and wow that is something that I don't even know what to do with that as a power and most women figure out how to deal with it I think and you know make some mistakes along the way and you know hurt some people but you know it all works out in the end people hurt each other in relationship with one another but there is a particular kind of I'm going to be as explicitly sexual as I possibly can be and then cry foul when anyone but perhaps might intend to target or maybe even anyone says anything to me that reveals the truth that we all know which is that you are explicitly sending sexual messages constantly and drawing the attention of all the straight men in the room and affecting what everyone else can do why are we not allowed to say this it's you in any room where there is a beautiful young woman who is actively exposing her sexuality either through you know phenotype or behaviorally or usually both it's the elephant in the room you never talk about it never ever it would be rude oh you don't allowed to do that that's just her choice well but isn't isn't she also changed their dynamic for everyone and is that less dangerous than a dude who threw a punch yeah in the moment the dude who threw a punch can be stopped like don't do that on the other hand this thing just like the authoritarian nonsense on the left is accepted it's culturally accepted and the authoritarian nonsense on the right isn't culturally accepted mostly and physical violence for men isn't culturally accepted mostly another factor in that you say it's culturally accepted is and I've had this exact argument where I've tried to make the point that women do have sexual power I've had people say it's not possible that the nature of the patriarchy means that they don't have power and I thought of all the all the places where when do have power it's surely in the sexual realm right no and and I'd always have and you know the yes rape is older than humans you know there are other primates rape and are raped and it's awful and it's true and it's never going to end completely but it is becoming more rare as we actually reveal that you know women are fully human as well you know every culture that actually has actually the less inequality between men the higher the rates of monogamy and the less violence against women and the less frankly patriarchal the culture is the more inequities in status between men the more likely there are to be very powerful men who actually control everything very disempowered men who have almost nothing and all of those women who are if they're straight and they're looking for mates trying to get with the few men up here and not the few men down here and that's not a stable or good Society it's just it's just not so you know Jordan Peterson got a lot of flack for his comment in a different New York Times article about enforced monogamy right and I read that article in forced monogamy that's really not a term we use much but it is a term over in evolutionary biology and it's a concept in evolutionary biology which is to say monogamy is enforced by women monogamy when it emerges as a social system as a mating system as it has in not very many mammals lots of birds for reasons that we won't get into here but I find fascinating anyway when mock monogamy emerges usually out of a polygynous system that is in which a single male mates with multiple females and therefore there are a lot of males who don't have any meeting opportunities at all when monogamy emerges out of a pledge in a system it is almost always when we can figure it out when the animal behaviors can go in and figure it out the women who are enforcing the monogamy who are preferring a world in which there are pair bonds and when one partners and therefore you know help with child care and just having you know partners for everything going forward to the degree that enforced monogamy is a thing it's enforced by women it's not enforced by men and I know for sure I haven't talked with him about it but I know for sure that that's that's what Jordan meant by that as well one of the interesting side effects of this conversation not being had in the mainstream and so many things being off topic for the mainstream is that and I wasn't really aware of this until started doing films about sexual dynamics and men and women after me too and some of topics that we've covered this huge oh this huge group online sort of a different kind of you can say Macau men's rights activists like the center of gravity online especially on YouTube is it is very different from the mainstream conversation and it seems that because that conversation is not allowed to be had the conversation around some women's sexual power for example the only place that exists is online and it often goes very toxic it's not women can behave in these ways women are people too it becomes women always behave you yeah women always behave in these ways women will always look for a man who's better than you etc etc and it's fascinating it's like if this because this conversation is not in the in the sunlight it often goes toxic and then goes really septic it seems oh I think that's exactly right and I think that's very much what's happening over you know so on the on the extreme right you've got people making population level claims about women and on the extreme left you have people making population level claims about all men and both of them are wrong and not to say that you know all men aren't more likely to display the horrors that some men display than they would be to display the horrors that some women display while still being very very unlikely to do so but I do think that this is this is why this is why I wanted even though I hate the terms this is why I wanted to make you know help make sure that there was a term to mirror the one that is being paraded around on the Left if toxic masculinity then okay toxic feminine and II and you know what in both cases hoping that they cancel each other out right yeah can can the eight of you over here on the eight of you over there just you know get together do your awful thing to each other can we lock you in a box together and then open the door in two years and either you're better or you're dead I think that was something but it's not it's obviously not everyone and it's not a majority in either group and the mistake is imagining that you know just to take to take the masculine side for the moment we can do it with both to imagine that being interrupted in conversation as a woman being interrupted by a man in conversation I'm gonna jump - Wow you're capable of rape aren't you know those are different things a woman let's see how can how can we do it for the for the female side you know two women get together and talk about what happened and an event the night before they're gossiping oh well then you're going to abandon your husband as soon as you know better guy comes around and use your sexual Wiles to capture someone with more money no most most women don't do that and most what men aren't and wouldn't be and couldn't be rapists but in in both sides there's a there's just no there's no good faith left I think and you know i I've I've mostly not seen the so you pronounced the acronym mug Tao looked I'll yeah and and mr a is I mostly haven't seen those discussions because the few times I've gone in they are so they're so toxic and and so awful that I just haven't spent time there but I you know I do feel the same way about in deepen over in an authoritarian left space it's not there aren't the same kinds of incitement to violence right but but it's just as awful one of the phrases that I wasn't familiar with him till we started making films about this topic was hypergamy I didn't really know what it meant I had to look it up but also it's it's tends to be used as a kind of catch-all conspiracy theory by a lot of the guys sort of in the more mgtow MRA type area hypergamy meaning that a woman will always look for a mate who's above her in status and it's used as you can never be certain with a woman because she will always be looking elsewhere yeah she's always looking elsewhere you can't help that it's in her nature and men you have to be aware of this what do you make of that as an evolutionary biologist yeah you know there there are things that men and women do that our evolutionary and not symmetrical and not universal but still sex specific and hypergamy while not a super common term in the literature is is a term that emerges from the evolutionary literature and it does it does touch on a reality which is that throughout most of pre human prehistory and recorded history as well precisely because of the sexual power that a young specifically through a bunch of history a young very young unmarried woman had she for a very brief moment in time had a chance to increase her lot in life greatly and at some point that that window was going to close and so she and maybe her parents maybe restated family depending on the type of society that she was in we're looking for the absolutely best bet and so how might that manifest in a modern is remaining and dating scheme a young woman who is well aware of her own sexuality and that she's a her prime and who every time she walks out the door has eyes on her which frankly you know young young women just have eyes on them all the time you just need it's hard not to know how much the world is looking at you if you if even if you're not exposing yourself just if you are of a certain age and like I said it all fit sort of the beauty norms fear if your culture is our are women going to be aware of those eyes and and potentially looking for an improvement in their lot perhaps is what's so what's the counterpoint what's and it's not it's not symmetrical it's not a mirror image because male and female are not mirror images of one another at all well the counterpoint I would say is the trope from literature and from reality and from everything in between that women upon having raised a man's children to some level of independence who will find themselves without a family as he goes and finds the next newest 20 a nubile 20 year old right that that men stick around through you know for a for a relationship until they now have the kind of power that you know men's power grows over time and women's sexual power anyway tends to decrease decrease over time so at the point that those lines kind of cross men are much more likely to overturn relationships and find someone else who looks like their wife did 20 years ago or 30 years ago so are both of those things true do they happen they do is it everyone no is it a risk yes does it you know does it warrant the idea that this is what all women do know do are all men going to consider or actually abandon their wives at the point that they aren't young things anymore no they're not and you must men don't so just like most men don't behave that way most women don't behave that way either something that just came up when I'm thinking about these sort of two perspectives is in both of those perspectives the other sex is seen as the enemy in some sense and in fact we should be collaborative and we are I mean we are when it works sorry I interrupted you no yeah I was gonna say in in both these perspectives there's sort of an implicit or explicit assumption it certainly implicit in a lot of sort of feminist theory like if you if you picked apart if you picked apart the Kathy Newman interviews I've seen some people do there's an implicit assumption a lot of her questions that men and women are pitted against each other and if you go on to sort of the more extreme ends of the the male-dominated manosphere there's this explicit yeah we're now will yeah looked at yeah women are that our interests are not aligned there essentially so different that we can't even exist together right it seems nuts to me and in fact if we are if we are thinking explicitly evolutionarily well we have in our past as what most long-lived social living primates have are two hierarchies within any group and there's a male hierarchy and there's a female hierarchy and it's confusing now when men and women are both doing you know work together that isn't inherently gendered and so that that has confused a lot of what people think they know about how it is they're supposed to be interacting with one another and and the fact that in some workplaces you know the fact that actual sex can come in do you like them at the prospect of sexual relationships comes into workplaces is also very confusing but overall women are much more likely to be compared to for the women and men with other men than men with women that men and women tend to be tend to have interests be they sexual or not and I think I mean in fact and this is this is a bit off topic but you know as as a as a happily married person myself it's just easier it's it's far easier to walk into relationships with with with new men like okay I know that whatever we're doing there's we don't have to wonder like is is it this other thing well it's not like you guys like you're here in my home with my husband and like you talk to him first like that's that's where we are that's not what we're doing so we can have a relationship that hopefully is you know a bit more like it might have been between two women or two men but because we're not actually the same sex maybe we can actually do it without the compatible combative stuff like more easily maybe even then two men could or two women could whereas we should expect that men are you know always sizing each other up to some degree and women are always sizing each other up to some degree but it's it should it should be a different less fraught set of interactions between men and women in some regards you mentioned that we used to have hierarchies male hierarchies and female hierarchies yeah is or are a lot of the problems that we're seeing at the moment a lot of the difficulties the results of bringing those hierarchies together yeah can you explain yeah no I mean this this is you know I wouldn't go back and you know I've taught I've talked with some very earnest actually young people looks like we just go back to the traditional roles it's like god no like I would certainly love for us to to once again celebrate mother full time motherhood if that's your choice which seems to many young women seem to not imagine that that's even on offer for them but it's never have been what I would have wanted and the idea that we should go back to a world that is prescribed in that way that is circumscribed for women in the domestic sphere sounds sounds confining at best so I'm extraordinarily grateful and that's very new but it came with a lot of chaos it came with a lot of destruction of of sort of an understanding of okay there are many spheres and women's spheres and women's spheres weren't entirely domestic there was plenty of you know there was plenty of empowerment but having men and women do mostly separate work kept relations between the genders much simpler I think and so this is this is an unexpected effect of maybe first wave a second wave feminism most of the effects for which I'm grateful this is a mess and it's not cool how to carefully get out of it although it is clear that those extremes on both sides are not the right way wherein you demonize an entire population and try to get them to subjugate themselves to you and your whims or else they're going to keep yelling at them that's not going to help hello [Music] you [Music]
