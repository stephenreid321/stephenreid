[Music] akira fully yeah return of the Mack yeah welcome to LA thank you man so it's what two months yeah couple months different world man different world different world amazing but it's a great day to be alive it's a beautiful days of really so I've sort of been tracking a little bit of what's been going on on Twitter we've been in touch a little bit yes and it seems that the meaning wave thing is getting a bit more pickup yes yeah it's useful it's proving useful in people's lives and I have committed to doing it a lot so we'd have interview mostly about Jordan Pederson yes JB p-wave now you've expanded into IDW eight well as we were talking about last time you were let go will there be more things I was like yes there are already at lots of other things me like oh really I was like yes look this and there was maybe eight or ten it was the beginnings of the meaning wave universe I did a poll to check what it was called it's good to involve other people some people were calling it the Donna verse and some people are calling it the akhirah verse but consensus is meaning wave universe so it's the meaning wave universe and there are many many members of the meaning way of the universe obviously peterson started it so Petersons like iron man you maybe think of it like the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is how I do think about it or conceptualize it he was kind of like Iron Man sort of the grounded tied into the actuality of the world as it was at that point and now it's sort of got to look Maurice oh it's Harry because we've gone on what why do this why why do this yeah that's a good question it seems like a fucking stupid things to do like ridiculous way to spend your time because it's necessary and because his yeah because it's necessary you know music is an incredibly powerful thing and music works on the frequencies of galaxies and the universe and music can really really change things music is a thing that you hear a bit of music it can take you it's like a time machine it's like an emotional time machine it can transport you decades it can music an incredibly incredibly powerful and the things that people talk about with in popular music for the mostly for the past 40 years have been an arrow a pretty narrow range of sort of thoughts and emotions which have usually been tied to the experience of the teenager pretty much and there's this thing in music when people and rap and so like all aspects of music people constantly feel there needs to be pretending to be a certain age like that's the experience of the 16 to 24 year old and anything outside of that is its deemed culturally bad or something and this is silly and this has led some really silly stuff and it has led to people pretending to be what they're not and it's led to a massive part of the human experience not being put within music which kind of damned part of why I did it was because uh I was waiting to be wise enough to make my third album and I wasn't wise enough yet like I hadn't lived enough of life I was able to make my first album and it'd be perfect and because that was about being a kid and I was able to make my second album and that was perfect that was about a person realizing they're no longer a kid but to make the album that's basically about being a man of a real fucking and connected like fully actualized man I wasn't quite there yet cuz I hadn't reached a level of experience and wisdom I needed to so I started making instrumental music and sampling people who was smarter and wiser than me because they've been there and they built a you know Peterson has spent four years thinking about certain things and therefore he has a good understanding of those things there are people out there who know a fuck of a lot of fuck of a lot of stuff but those experiences hadn't necessarily been putting music before so I put them in music and now people have that and it's proving very very useful in people's lives and I get hundreds of messages every day at this point from people who like this has completely changed my life right business of this in the gym or I listen to this on the way of work I posed to my father so now he understands things or I play this to my children so they understand things whatever the hell it is it's like a thing that was missing in the culture because there's also something about the way the music relaxes the system and allows the words to come in yes is that something that's deliberate or about something yes very deliberate and it's a constant refinement process of getting better I think I'm a lot better at it now then I was when I started and again that all the whole just insists I released three things a week so it's sticking to that schedule is very difficult and and it involves a lot of working out systems and we're finding ways of becoming faster and more efficient but also just getting better and it is really important that this that it works rhythmically and that it works unconsciously and there isn't anything in there this that kind of sticks out and ruins the overall flow effect you should be able to listen to it without focusing on the words and you should be able to listen to it while focusing on the words mmm and there should be enough of it that's hooky and catchy like a regular pop song that you know you could maybe hum along as well or have a little bit that remember but also it needs to have the depth that the subject is coming across properly hmm and you can take it in at a decent speed what's the biggest challenge with making something like is it finding the the words as it finding that the original content I think it's doing justice to the truth of it and the spirit of it is the tricky thing well though the hardest thing and they also he seems to get harder as it goes along while I'm doing well in some ways it gets easier in there like I'm paying attention to synchronicity and I'm sort of flowing and I'm moving very fast but it's also like just harder and harder and harder because have a more aware of the gravity of it and the that it's important to people so I can't fuck up and it has to be and I know you know these are if you're taking the words for someone who spent 34 years thinking about a thing then you better do justice to how those words are presented hmm and you'd better not misrepresent those words while at the same time making it foggy [Music] people are just not pushing the right transmit counter album just drop it just was like that's a strange entering suddenly you've got all these psychedelic possibilities and as we were talking about last time I've been predicting this swing back into sort of psychedelia and people have been interested in more out their concepts whether it be sort of a psychedelic II a CD type stuff or chaos magic or and lo and behold all this stuff seems to be kicking off already and so what enough happened was there was a break in the place there's a glitch in the matrix brink of the frames there's a glitch of the major of Lincoln that like we got in touch at first because you remix the glitch in the matrix film Bank classic classic classic I'd not really thought about it at the time but the making of glitch in the matrix was my kind of leap out of one world into another one I'd find it quite awkward I think to go into a newsroom with someone who and an organization I'm pretty much criticized and presumably you would find it very limiting giving like now your scope is kind of you know you can sit down and have conversations about whatever you want for as long as you want yeah the only limit is your imagination yeah presumably there's not even you know Lentz or whatever there is no bandwidth limitations so you see me going back into that system you would feel somewhat confined yeah true and it it also it's like what's the right lens to look at what's going on at the moment and I think we're in the kind of times where the right lens is not the political it's not the it's not the kind of cert all the surface level kind of analysis is just becoming less and less apparent because what we're dealing with is I think we're dealing with a kind of phase shift a potential phase shift in and this is the time where all of these really deep questions of what are your axioms what are your assumptions about the world what are becoming increasingly relevant and we've taught in the rebel wisdom kind of podcast we've talked about the end of the age of materialism I think that's what we're seeing we're seeing return of kind of the archetypal we're seeing a return of the kind of acuity we're seeing a return of as Pedersen is kind of a Herald of this kind of the reintegration for sacred as well yeah all these things okay these vast crossing these worlds yeah between the sort of like a typical in the sort of grounded on full-blown material yes yes yes he's a scientist yeah yeah but also it's sort of like an interest in the divine and he doesn't squat yeah a lack of scorn for certain concepts and again this is like we were talking about before this sort of swing from them it's a hard material back into the sort of psychedelic hmm and we've kind of gone through this intense dark political period of everyone screaming at each other and wishing death upon each other and flinging around horrible words and splitting up with their families and divorcing their wives and all these things over ridiculous ridiculous stuff but with swinging back and as we swing back we swing up and we can look down upon this stuff rather than being sort of down because you think we're going into a new sort of psychedelia time yeah we're definitely doing that and that's broken you can see that everywhere are people it's the concepts people are getting interested in talking about the drugs that people are starting to mention the colors in clothes you saw this with Kanye West who's always on the cutting edge of this stuff and aside from sort of shifting the culture with music he's been doing it with clothes for many years now as well his previous collection was all this dark stuff the joke was like you couldn't tell if it was a homeless person or someone wearing $2,000 Yeezy jacket but it was just this dark sort of like military ish and his new collection is all sort of rainbow stuff it's all wood stopping sort of like bright colors joyfulness sunshine smiles or this type of thing hmm and you see that kind of thing everywhere as you were saying seven years is that does that yeah yeah is it getting fun I wonder whether it might be getting faster no it stays the same but it's like each time it bangs in one direction it kind of gets sort of heavier hmm so you have like the mini ones which is seven years then you have like much larger ones which are more like sixty years but haven't worked out exactly what that is but we're going back into psychedelia right as of now like as it past few months but it's going to be way bigger this time because of the way things are online and because of all being interconnected and the lessons we've learned in the past few it's going to be a much huger psychedelic explosion and because we're also connected it's going to have permanent effects on the sort of culture at large and the brain at what you cook this sort of the bay thing is when you think about the company other consciousness is an overused word but just look at videos of people in the 70s versus people now it's a completely different species and the species that's emerging right now is a completely different one to that which we use doing you see most of the people you see on televisions are at different species to the species that's emerging now and the species that's watching these things online and it's gonna be really instrumental in where the cultures going did you see we did an interview with Michael Pollan the guy food writers just released a book about psychedelics called how to change your mind and this is one last week it was about a couple of weeks ago but one of the questions I asked him because he he's New York Times best-selling writer one of the top hundred writers they like the Malcolm Gladwell of food almost right and he's written of he studied it for few years did his own psychedelic trips and has now released a book about it and my question to him was is this the most significant moment in the psychedelic Renaissance and the answer is yes am i I can't I can't say who but but someone very close to me watched it and immediately said I wanted to try this and he said in the interview he has a way of writing about things that makes people want to do them yes and this is by far the most significant kind of public validation of psychedelics so it makes perfect sense of it yeah assume it's literally having everywhere every drogon conversations suddenly after six years of it being quite like hardcore life stuff material stuff is suddenly back in that world again it's it's uh people coming on talking about like treating depression with ketamine and psychedelics and stomach is suddenly this big thing just over the past few weeks I was talking about terence mckenna's brother was hosting a psychedelic science conference in Los Angeles last Sunday hmm just suddenly popped up mainstream the whole thing with the psychedelics thing is one of those things that and people always said this you know once you do it it changes you fundamentally and you suddenly the world aspects of the world were closed previously open up yeah and anyone who's done it will tell you that and anyone who seems to have any kind of major influence on things on a scientific level or the cultural level is usually had some experience like them so once it cracks open on the mainstream and everyone does it that means everyone all the stuff all the little corridors and ideas that the Internet's opening up in people's minds and once that's coupled with the real life thing as we've spoke about previously it's a very important for us to move these online discussions into the real world and these online experiences into the real world and the psychedelic thing I believe is going to be a massive part of that hmm and once those doors are opened they cannot be closed once these Pandora's what was in Pandora's box genius once these genies are out these lamps and once these Pandora's boxes are open they cannot be undone and the cut that's that says forever shifted on to the next phase because psychedelics can also I think about this the other day it's like you also it also makes people very susceptible conspiracy theories it makes people very susceptible to like you may stop believing in the kind of traditional story of society but you become very susceptible to believing all kinds of other shit yes and this happens in the previous psychedelic cycle hmm and then we went out of that and then the conspiracy people whose weirdo the conspiracy thing flipped and CNN San Lee became Infowars and vice versa and a weird source and there's some very strange sort of fashion but you have to kind of have that because people have to be able to tokens who had no idea some part of being open to new ideas is also you know being open to bad ideas or silly ideas have you but we're in this new period of being open to new ideas but we have toolkit now toolkit seems to be in both as a word lady anyway we have a better toolkit for dealing with these things and because we're all connected together in this in these larger networks and because we've been listening to these three our conversations with smart people hmm a lot of the things that we were drawn to in the first phase of the internet conspiratorial wise it's been done so you can't do it again hmm so once you've gone into that particular little pocket and you've looked at all those ones and you've come out and you've worked out what was real and what wasn't it's not that you just gonna repeat that it means this time we're gonna look at sort of bigger ideas and deeper ideas and we're gonna go further and deeper and there will be some nonsense in there but there will be some some deep deep amazing truths which will help is reach deeper than our pasts and go forth to Mars hmm McKenna was talking where you'll DJ what's that where I will be DJ McKenna was talking about this at the end of society a society collapses or a part of it dies whenever that happens the smart people of the time will look into the deep past for uh for something valuable to move it forward I think was eaten archaic what's that the okay with revival yeah he calls it yes and he was talking about this in 91 but I think is very relevant or hampered Sheldrake who we interviewed as well that's why we you know you're deep in the heart of a little thing yeah that's where we're at right now and we have our Council of wise men of which the ID W yeah are a part they're one of these councils of wise men hmm and yeah yeah that's my my sense with the IDW is that it's an early almost like a placeholder for the growth of this conversation it's like a kind of line in the sand of these are people who prepare to speak their truth these are people who are not prepared to be kind of shamed by the mainstream media and to not talking about certain subjects but I think it's almost like a beachhead that they're a minute hill yeah it's like a beachhead that then allows a bigger conversation to take place yeah because as we was saying earlier a couple of years ago people were terrified to talk about certain things in public in a way that that they're not as terrified now and I feel that that has shifted massively just over the past few months hmm I'm saying this in real life I'm seeing this in clubs I'm seeing this on the street I'm seeing people who previously were keeping their mouths shut because they were just a bit scared and we're in Los Angeles here and by the way which is you know very so consensus people everyone's terrified of saying the wrong thing because then they'll lose their representation I won't get hired to be in movies and things of that nature which happens it happens in a big way in comics it's happening in a big way it's happening in everything but people are a lot less scared right now in the summer of 2018 than they were in a spring 2018 and people are having these conversations and people are openly kind of like mocking people who try and throw some Nancy and things at them Medicus for discussing stuff that's now you you mentioned this earlier this it's on British channel 3 and channel 4 or something right there a sketch comedy previously mocking this this stuff so that that's great mm-hmm and but you know that is you said this is just the beginning is the beginning of these conversations and the bigger ones that we had as we move into this new glorious Eon hmm you seem a lot more optimistic than the last time I suppose you I'm optimistic and also this is the paradox it's like and I think both of these things are true at the same time you can look at things like Steven Pinker and say look at all of these indices we are more wealthy we have more and the freedom all this stuff than it is the greatest day to be alive in your history and that is absolutely true you're serious look at it it's amazing but it's also true that we are so interdependent our technologies in a certain we are also in a very fragile situation yeah one particularly like excitable sunspot activity would wipe out every hard drive in it just like that yeah boom but I guess what we would deal with it instantly because that's what we always do we're very very good at that we're done very very very quickly I'm I am more I am more pessimistic well I'm also optimistic at the same time that some a lot of the thinkers that I'm following sort of most closely like Jordan green hall for example Brett Weinstein well I think Eric as well as much more much more pessimistic than say Jordan Peters all of those I was thinking because they're talking about it's like okay we we are in a better situation in many ways but we are incredibly fragile and we're so interdependent the the pressures on the system are getting more and more and I think all of those are true at the same time and I think actually we are going to be tested more than any but I think we're going into a period of like real conflict and real chaos but I think we'll come out ready in it yeah we're all I think it's gonna I think it's going to increase yeah exponentially yeah well but we're more likely to deal with it than ever we were before yeah and the main thing is you know children the children who did who you know we're at the last generation who remember no internet and it's and after that it's just been Internet and one when you're just Internet when you're just a creature of Internet is a completely different mindset and it completely different way of viewing everything and those motherfuckers do not have the hang-ups that everyone before them had hmm and they're much better equipped to deal in the sort of speed that's required and in the kind of flow that's required a sort of flow statements that have been thinking about this whole thing a lot but part of the way I've been working in this hyper hyper productive ridiculousness has taught me super powers in a way that previously I just sort of like suspected but putting it into practice like forcing yourself to work every day with this incredible tunnel vision and forcing yourself to rely on instincts and forcing yourself to notice every synchronicity and to act upon that as if there's a guidepost puts you in an incredible flow state where everything suddenly becomes magical and things just seem to happen of their own accord and you just keep going and do not stop and do not deviate then it's it's just wonderful and insane and magical and you get an awful lot done and it's really good and increasingly so being in that kind of state internet children a way more equipped and ready to exist as that and to accept that as a possible reality and to do that way more than people before them so as we move into this stuff and all these programs arise and stuff which is way way better equipped to deal with them in this in this generous generations that are rising up we'll be able to deal with these things one of them I think it was probably when I first met you because we connected on online on Twitter and you just so happened to be coming over to the UK afterwards and you've remix glitch and the matrix was the first time I realized having put put my stuff out there that the internet is a machine for generating synchronicities yes that's what it's for yeah because because it's the action yeah it becomes don't even keep doing it you keep moving you have to move with the speed of the Internet the speed of the incident is different to the speed of so-called real life it's a lot faster a week in the Internet is like six months in so-called real life so you have to move with the speed of the incident you have to be like a shark mmm you have to keep moving you have to observe synchronicities and realize that there are signposts for the direction of an eating snake you have to eat steak each state honest yeah that's a big part of my success but it's yeah I'm fueled by stake in meaning stake in meaning that was the other bit that's missing is you have to have meaning behind what you're doing and then if meaning is the motivation and synchronicity of the signposts and you just move like a fucking shark you know water a river is beautiful and clean and amazing as a wonderful thing but when it sort of gets stopped it becomes what does it come a pond or something like stagnates and horrible things groaning it's very problematic it must be like a river and you know there's that's that's the natural state of internet generation hmm I believe so I don't think I think that that will counteract a lot of the problems and I think the steam culture idea that Alan Moore used to talk about that we're now in we're in we move from the culture of say the amount of time it took to go from the invention of the stone axe to the Roman Baths then the amount of time it takes to create the same amount of stuff is half that and it keeps dividing kind of Moore's law yes indeed like that so you go from a fluid culture to a culture where suddenly so much stuff is happening all at once it's like steam and we're in that right now like you know thing could be invented in three minutes that fixes the issue of plastic in C or something least nu I'm reading about all this stuff every days I go someone just worked out to fix that and someone just worked out to fix that these problems that seemed just completely unsurmountable for many many years lots of these things are being fixed and will be fixed like very quickly you know and then there'll be new problems but I think we're really really well equipped to to sort out all of our issues as Peterson said recently one of the things the whole Joe Rogan podcast everything phenomenon shows is that we're actually way smarter then everyone gave us credit for which you if you talk to people if you actually talk to people and listen to them you'll know this anyway mmm you know I go to pubs and bars where the people apparently supposedly like ignorant idiot working-clothes racists who sneered upon by the London anti brexit people and the the American anti Trump people you go talk to these people they're not dumb and if you listen to them for more than three minutes you'll find they're not done the channels through which things are observed and have been like propagating stuff or done hmm the old media was done and the way put things across was done and now we're in a brave new world where there is space and room for intelligence and for people to educate themselves at the right place exactly hmm exactly that that's a whole other big conversation the whole education thing yeah that's the thing about this this new generation of Internet is they're able to educate themselves anything that interests them - as far as as far as they're willing to go down that subject and they are doing them hmm and I made them all the time and they write to me all the time I have a discord now where all these all my new sort of meaning wave era fans hang out and the most active chat room is the philosophy chat room which is just buzzing all the sites and notifications offices just ping ping ping ping ping there's in there having played really big deep conversations about stuff and saying oh go look at this and go look at this look at that and deliver that hmm the second biggest room is the means room of course and then you know what would usually a bit of sort of general chat or music or whatever is quick to lower down on the list of interests and these are all or generated what's it called alone millennial anyway whatever is yeah those ones away smarter than we were and they're way more they're way more developed than we were mmm you know you can know if you can operate an iPad which is essentially a supercomputer you can operate that age three what the hell are you gonna do when you're 23 whatever my my only concern about that generation is it is that they're growing up within sort of like a public shaming kind of space yeah well the cyber yeah the cyber bullying and stuff like I'm like I think about what I post on Facebook and there are certain things I wouldn't post on there there are certain things like I get pushed back for posting and I'm pretty disagreeable like I'm prepared to sort of speak my mind and I can express myself fairly well and I think about the generation below and yet even so you get kind of publicly shamed or attacked for sharing certain things and I think the generation below ours like it must be really hard to develop your own voice because if you say something out of line that someone can say oh that's racist or sexist this is typically this is a tiny blip it's something we have to get through to get to the other side on the other side because when everyone realizes oh shit everyone's done something bad everyone's got something dark about them everyone's got something about them that I don't agree with everything that will be the major realization you might take 10 years to get there or something but when we get there everyone knows that everyone else has something about them that's bad something in their past there's bad it something about them that you disagree with and once everyone gets to that point okay we're all the same and there's gonna be a lot of casualties along the way but we're like I was saying I'm already seeing that whole little thing of people worrying about what people of having the wrong opinion and being publicly shamed that's lessening and people are getting braver yeah people are getting a lot braver and they're realizing they're not alone various states sort of shame or the promise or anguish or what have you so this is a thing that will be dealt with from the other side of it is a much freer space something that none of us ever had before yeah in public to be sort of connected to the whole world and be able to be yourself completely hmm in all of its horrible and wandering glory and as we were talking about earlier if one sort of mass squeegees everybody then suddenly everyone is aware of all these other aspects that are out there of reality at all times and prospects that are in here as well which is pretty terrifying yes well again then that takes us back to the whole shadow thing and all that and that's a big part of it yeah the integration of the shadow is an integral part of the moving forward and it's but it's that's a bit like what I was saying about the whole getting over the shaming thing it's like once everyone integrate realizes that everyone has a shadow first you have to realize you do mmm then everyone else does and then everyone works out how best to utilize that stuff and you know use those forces mmm then you have that sort of thing fixed that's great then you all do the sort of psychedelic experience on mass and then you go oh shit look at all these aspects of reality and stuff there are isn't this beautiful and wonderful and we're all connected in this thing and then you actually are all connected because the whole digital thing has happened mmm yeah yeah no it's a good point it's like before you do like in the 60s people would do psychedelics and go buy it we're all one it's like well actually now because of the technology we are all you are pretty close to it actually that being true yeah it is yeah so when she bad the psychedelic thing to that mmm so previously those realizations would happen in the corner of a room with a few people look girl one but it's only us who are all wanted you can't explain it to anyone else and I think you're mad this time very fucking different this time it's the generation of people who already know that world one there or do you know that we're all connected already know any kind of illusion sort of cultural barriers are silly in there they grew up this thing's a sort of Japanese reggae and Dutch techno and and la trappe at the same time they don't have any of those sort of cultural barriers that previous generations did and they truly are all connected by technology in a mental psychedelic fucking cyberpunk Blade Runner fashion terrible cultural appropriation you know that although that's great because that whole intersectionality thing's brilliance it just destroys itself so they oldest all those people can go destroy themselves all those people with their sort of very surface very narrow very material way of sort of like being angry and upset about the world that's a thing of the past and that will eat itself and destroy itself meanwhile over here we can have like big big conversations and go to Mars and we don't yeah let's squeegee the third eye squeeze you the third eye on yeah our IP Bill Hicks oh we've been really nice to Bill Hicks trips in all this stuff mm-hmm he was he was a cynical person but he had this he'd had these psychedelic experiences which gave me a little glimmer of hope hmm it's a wonder for the glory of humanity hmm and all of its splendor history is just a twenty five thousand year - from the trees to the star show [Music] there has been well-received like I've seen Eric Weinstein tweeting something for house and Jordan Peterson tweeting it out and how does that feel yeah it's beautiful thing what all one wants in life is to self actualize and have the respect of one's peers and you know it to be yeah to be able to self-analyze to do what you're good at and makes you you sing makes your soul sing what make sure it makes your soul shine whatever it is and and then to get the respect of one's peers as an inker is a truly wonderful thing and it was something I wrote that I wanted to some years ago I was like that's basically what I want but at that point I thought of my peers being other people who made music whereas now it's actually it's sort of it's way bigger than that and now my peers are by all the biologists and musicians and professors and psychologists psychologists and all sorts of people which is wonderful because that's another thing I wanted to do as well which was kind of move music or create music that could exist usefully across all these spheres and musicals all these people are keeping you keep as you get older in life you see people around you to sort of switching off from music and thinking oh well that's for kids or that's me younger people and then you start hearing these are well music was way better when I was young musics all crap now because they kind of stopped and everyone associates good music with the first time they've got their dick sucked which is why the top comment on every YouTube video is that music was so much better in my day whatever that day was but it's because of like I was saying although most pop music it's kind of not made for people over 24 you know so if so creating a music that could be listened you know again I'm not saying that like pop music is useless when you're over 24 because I listen to a hell of a lot of pop me is it can I listen to a lot of so-called ignorant rap music and I love little pompe all that type of stuff but you know there's there's a whole aspect of it that will it wasn't being served as well as it should and it could then bring all these people together perhaps yeah once what was that Eric Weinstein said you haven't made it until the cure the donors turned you into a song yes she's which is true well you haven't yeah you haven't but you have yeah you actually very early yeah you were very early on that as a as a recipient the other icing of the dawn thank you yeah it worked means a lot you deserve it you and it you're out there making your ancestors proud which is what you know we should all be doing yeah we should all be thinking of our ancestors and thinking of everything that they went through so we could get to this point of hitherto unimaginable luxury and potential here in this incredible summer of love 2018 thank you are you over [Music] you
