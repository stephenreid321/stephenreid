[Music] Jordan it's great to to interview you again I need you back in October last year and then made I've now made two documentaries about you and a big focus for rebel wisdom is kind of making sense of the cultural moment and making sense of your success and whatever it presents and I don't know if you remember but the very first question I asked you back in October and the interview was firstly what you make of your success so far and are you ready for it to continue because I had I had a sense back then that what your message represented was something the culture desperately needed the sort of and what that signifies to me is a kind of reintegration of a sacred did you have any sense back then the the exponential success that you were going to have between then and now well I mean the most likely outcome at each of the what would you say at each point where I might notice what's going on around me has been that this was stalled but it isn't stopping so I've been thinking about that pretty much non-stop I would say and I have some some solutions let's say or some ideas that I didn't present in October so one of the things I've realized is that part of what's pushing part of what's accounting for this the popularity of my ideas is actually a secondary consequence of a technological revolution and I've seen that more clearly since October partly because I can see the mainstream media dying at a faster and faster rate and the alternative media expanding faster and faster so television radio and the classic print media had shared one thing in common which was a extreme restriction in bandwidth this was especially true of television because each minute of television given the necessity to broadcast and the expense that was unbelievably expensive and so there just wasn't time to do anything on television there's no time and so if you had something important to say or even something unimportant for that matter most of the time it had to be compressed into something approximating 30 seconds which wouldn't even be your words it would be a journalist common commenting on what you said and if you were really pushing the envelope maybe you'd have 25 minutes on a talk show that was devoted to your ideas but then even that would be highly scripted and so television made people look stupider than they were even to the producers of television because of this narrow bandwidth the the rise of video online and audio as well has blown the bandwidth limitation out of our mass communication and it turns out that people are smarter with longer attention spans than we thought what happened with me was that for one reason or another I was an early adopter of that technology and so there's this massive technological transformation which is a Gutenberg revolution in the provision of video and audio no barrier to production because it doesn't cost anything anyone can do it people can communicate with it you can cut up YouTube videos you can make your documentaries the entry point is easy audio podcasts and that sort of thing which can be of indefinite length allow people to use found time to listen more people can listen than can read like all of these things add up to a massive technological revolution and it's that upswell in technology that in part has propelled what I've been doing to tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu this mass audience and so that's been a relief to figure that out because it depersonalized is it to some degree right and so I used the metaphor when I've been asked about this before of being on a wave I'm surfing on a giant wave but the wave isn't something that I've done it's part of this technological revolution so that's a relief to know that and I'm quite convinced that that's the case because there are other people who are occupying the same space essentially Joe Rogan is a very good example of that and the various commentators on on YouTube who've become increasingly influential and powerful same thing driven by the technology they happen to be early adopters and so and then there's a secondary question which is well is there anything specific in relationship to my content let's say and I would say also that is a the case and I think what I've been able to do with reasonable effectiveness is to draw a conceptual equation equivalence between the meaning that's necessary to sustain you in life given its suffering and malevolence and the necessity to adopt responsibility and I think there's something new about that I mean I don't know how new I'm sure I am NOT the first person who's discovered that but I think I've done a reasonable job of pointing out to people that that the suffering that's intrinsic to life in the absence of meaning is not tolerable it it it destroys and corrupts and that the proper pathway out of that isn't rights or happiness or entitlement or or anything that's associated with with with individual ease let's say but with the adoption of something approximating maximal responsibility and people get that like it's it's not that hard to understand when it's laid out like that and lots of people especially young people especially people who are young and also somewhat nihilistic in their orientation perhaps because of an excess of intellectual criticism or they grab that immediately think oh there's the missing piece I see it's that the the antidote to this meaninglessness this void that I'm for isn't hedonism it's not right it's not impulsive pleasure it's none of that it's responsibility it's like oh yes okay that everything snaps into place and so that's been I think that's the most essential part of the message to the degree that what I'm doing has an essential message that would be it and I do think that's what it counts for a large part of its impact and you mentioned Joe Rogan before and you and here group together in this sort of new constellation of the intellectual dark web what do you see is the I mean what you make of your kind of inclusion in this and what do you see is its role going forward in the culture well well it's it's it's it's like a herd of cats right because so I've thought about well what what what unites us to the degree that there's an us because that's not so self-evident there's enough of an ask so that the name emerged and it's stuck so so there's something in common because otherwise the name wouldn't have stuck right you can't name nothing it doesn't work and I've talked a fair bit about this with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin and I have been touring together right he opens my my discussions and adds a nice comedic touch to them and so what do we have in common everybody in the group is an independent practitioner so an entrepreneur essentially with their own media enterprise that's autonomous none of us are serving any master except the audience so so and and we're all somewhat independent financially as a consequence of that and so that makes us beholden to no master all of us are engaged in these long-form discussions right and one of the consequences of being engaged in a long-form discussion is that you can assume that your intelligence that your audience is intelligent and so that's another thing that unites everybody in the group is we all assume that our audience is intelligent but I think that that's not so much a consequence of any particular moral virtue on our parts but an observation that the technology has made possible it's like oh when you can see this I would say particularly with Roman because in some sense he's a trailblazer in this domain it's like Oh turns out my audience will listen to the three-hour discussion but he wouldn't have been able to discover that without the technology right so now to his credit he was smart enough to discover it and smart enough to notice it when he discovered it and so and I think that also characterizes the rest of the people in this group it's like oh look at that the audience actually wants our listeners that say and viewers want detailed in-depth unscripted spontaneous meaningful conversation and then really are willing to go in that direction that's the risk-taking element like I can give an example of that so I just did for talks with Sam Harris who's often grouped into this group as well on the relationship between science and religion say or facts and values that's another way of thinking about it with a bit of politics thrown in discussion of left/right differences and so on what's the willingness to take the risk well I had no idea when I met Sam in Vancouver which was where the first two of the four talks were held I'd never met him before we did a two podcast together one of which was very we got locked in the other one which was more productive I would say but I had no idea of he had I could talk but we we were willing to willing to I guess that's right agreed to take the risk to see if we could talk in a public forum and and I think that's another thing that characterizes the people in that group is that they will take those sorts of risks if you go into a television studio a classic television studio all the conversation is scripted and it's actually quite frustrating because you can't have a conversation with the journalist because the journalist isn't there who's there is a frontispiece for the organization and the organization has scripted all there so it's not actually like talking to a person it's really like talking to a puppet so for better or for worse but in these long unscripted long-form conversations then you can take the risk of having a conversation and that can go spectacularly well but it can also fail dismally so I would say those are the things that unite us to the degree that the group exists I mean I met when I was in LA a week ago and about 7 of us got together for for dinner and that was the first time we we'd met as anything approximating a group and you know it was interesting to watch everybody interact because as I said it really is a herd of cats there's a tremendous diversity of political opinion and a tremendous diversity of personality like Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan like they're not even members of the same species in some ways you know so so it's a very fractious group but I think those things that I outlined are the elements that basically unite it there's also something that I sense watching some of the discussions there's a kind of intellectual curiosity and a sense of people thinking in public and and there's also a sense of maybe the potential for people to change their minds or to discover things during the conversation well that's partly the appreciation of the intelligence of the audience it's like and I would say it is actually the manifestation of the process of thinking that's more important than the conclusions that are generated even in these discussions that I've been having with Harris like we are trying to to argue out to different viewpoints because Harris believes that values can be derived with with with unerring precision in some sense using the proper methodology from facts and I I believe that it's more complicated than that that there has to be intermediating structures and those are really narrative and in their nature so there's a technical argument as well as a variety of sub arguments of the relative role of traditional religion and so forth but the outcome of the debate about those issues is partly what people are coming to the talks to see to to to determine what should the conclusions be but a much larger part perhaps is to in to observe and engage at least by proxy in the process of dialogue and that's more important because dialogue is the process by which complex problems are solved which is what makes me a free speech advocate fundamentally well it's not an advocate it's like I realized that that the protection for free speech is protection of the mechanism whereby complex social problems are solved and were were the people in this group and many other people as well are acting out that dialogical process and and people are happy about that as they should be and I read The Spectator review of your recent conversation I think you've now come to the end of your debate for sam harris and they said that you expressed a little bit of irritation at some of the when Sam didn't grass some of the points that you were making or that you didn't fully appreciate that he'd and understood them I also think that Sam Harris in particular he's built a whole kind of personality career several books on this atheism position do you think that he can argue in good faith from that perspective could he turn around and say well actually no you're right Jordan this atheism thing is a bit no I think he was I think he was I think he was conducting the discussion in good faith I actually think that what Sam is doing is a good faith project you know he I think there's conceptual muddiness about it but you know his basic premise is that we could come to an agreement that working to reduce unnecessary misery and suffering is a universal good okay fair enough that seems like a reasonable proposition I don't think it's a proposition of fact and he claims that it is but that doesn't matter still it's fair enough then and then you know that's what proposition another proposition is it would be really good if our systems of value weren't founded on error and what do we have that's not error well we have facts we have objective facts I mean look at the technology look at what we've done with our science it's like you do want to underestimate the utility of objective facts so maybe we can ground the value structure in the facts it's like well that would be good if we could do it so and and so and then his his ethic let's say is an amalgam of those two propositions and I think that his project is honorable and and and I think he's committed to it he also rightly is concerned with the dangers of the Fundamentalist dangers of revealed truth and so is very skeptical about about the axiomatic claims of of dogmatic religion yeah fair enough but his the mechanisms that he outlines to derive values from facts are insufficient in my estimation I don't think that his argument is sufficiently sophisticated even though I don't doubt it's I don't think that Sam is any less committed to an ethical good it's not obvious to me that he is than I am you know and he's argued and discussed fully in good faith as far as I'm concerned you know with the with the odd error because no one is negotiating 100% all the time in good faith I mean that's a standard that no one can can this can achieve but I think the discussions have been unbelievably productive and and we'll see that certainly the crowds are responding I don't think the crowds would have been engaged if Sam wouldn't be wouldn't been discussing in good faith you know because the engagement is actually an indication that a good faith discussion is is occurring otherwise it gets dull very very rapidly we'll see what happens when the videos are released and that'll be in August once there the sound is edited and all that and and then people will have a public debate about how it how the discussion proceeded I also think that each discussion built on the previous one and that we both ended up I think we both ended that more informed and more articulate then we started out so that's a good that's a really good thing I certainly understand his arguments much better than I did well a year ago let's say and I've heard Eric Weinstein described sort of the cultural moment as a kind of civil war within the left sort of extreme left and then the sort of moderate soft left which are probably sort of the at least the dominating kind of paradigm in the media I I'm I've got a lot of progressive friends and what I see happening recently maybe in the last couple of weeks is a lot of them starting to grapple with your ideas and looking at lasting this question what can the left learn from jordan peterson which is which is a pretty new development because i saw a lot of kind of reactivity to it before how can you personally contribute to that debate and debate you're interesting oh yeah absolutely no no doubt about it no doubt about it what one thing that i've been doing in my tour repeatedly when i talked about the first chapter of my book which is stand up straight with your shoulders back it's a discussion of hierarchies and and their eternal nature right because my claim is is not my claim i think its mere fact that organisms that have to cooperate and compete with other organisms of their type inevitably arrange themselves into hierarchies and that's been going on for so long which is at least 300 million years that our nervous systems have adapted to hierarchies as if there are permanent element of being right more permanent than trees like seriously permanent at the most fundamental neurochemical the one that regulates the entire brain serotonin is acutely sensitive to hierarchical distinctions and so that's part of the is it so the reason I laid that proposition forward was to say whatever pitfalls hierarchies might produce you cannot lay them at the feet of the West patriarchy or capitalism it's like that's a non-starter you're wrong and not just a little bit wrong you're so seriously wrong that if you insist upon doing that you won't even achieve your own aims because you're actually not grappling with the problem the problem is if hierarchies are a problem which they are the problem is way more serious than mere capitalism it's way deeper and if you're actually interested in rectifying the constantly the negative consequences of hierarchies then you're going to have to get a lot more sophisticated than there then your idiot Marxism so so so part of the elaboration of that argument is well hierarchies are inevitable because we have to solve complex problems and we have to solve them socially and when you implement a solution to a complex problem socially you produce a hierarchy because some people are better at the implementation than others so there's a hierarchy of competence and then there's a hierarchy of distribution of the Spoils and so and in both of those hierarchies you get a disproportionate clumping of resources at the top and dispossession at the bottom in the nature of hierarchies so what's the left for the left is to remind those who are benefiting from the hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost is the clumping of people at the bottom and that that's an eternal cost and it's not trivial and so that's what the left should be properly focused on the Left should be providing the voice of those who are dispossessed by hierarchies and the right should be saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are necessary and they're not only necessary but they're also productive than the left says yes but they tilt towards tyranny and they can be occupied inappropriately by people who are playing games of power fair enough the right has to take that into account the hierarchy can rigidify and is likely to do that and it can be taken over by people who are corrupt and that's likely to happen and so but but it's okay because the dialog could work out the the right could say well yeah we need the damn hierarchies and they need to be but wrists and the left can say yes but they have to be maintained properly so they don't deteriorate and degenerate and and I think that's I think that's ancient wisdom I think the ancient Egyptians had figured that out in their symbolic representations so now when the left goes too far it does something like say well how about no hierarchies it's like no how about not wrong because all that happens if you flatten one of the things that happens if you flatten out the hierarchy is that you can't even organize your perceptions you can't perceive the world without looking at the world through a hierarchy of value and if because you can't perceive the world unless you make one thing more important than all the other things because you don't even know what to look at and if one thing isn't more important than all the other things then you have nothing to aim at if you have nothing to aim at then you have no meaning in your life so the left can't just demolish the hierarchies in the name of some equality of outcome let's say because you blow out the future you leave people aimless and you destroyed the very institutions that allow people to make competent progress in the world that's not an acceptable outcome so we have to we have to agree to live with the tension necessity for hierarchies the proclivity for them to pathologize and the the necessary voice of the left and speaking for thee for the dispossessed so and I mean I've as far as I'm concerned I've said something approximating that through my entire career and so the fact that the left wingers have been irritated at me is well in some sense that's an inevitable consequence of me taking on the radical left wingers but it's also the refusal by the moderate left to deal with their internal problems and the sticking point that I hear a lot from my sort of more progressive friends is you're sort of primary focus is on the individual yeah well that's that's too bad for them because the primary should be you know I can agree with that but what I the the paradox that they would say it's like okay focus on the individual but you have to accept that there are some situations that are much more conducive to an individual thriving than other situations so their focus on structural inequality you're focusing on the individual is there not some interplay between most definitely well obviously because people do have group identities the question is whether whether the group or the individual identity should be paramount and the left distance the radical leftist answer is well there is the look it's not me that's failing to take into account those two levels of analysis it's the bloody radical leftist because for them it's the collective and that's that and so it's obvious as far as I'm concerned that people have their individuality and then behind that they have their they have their group like multiple group identities which is also a big problem but also poverty or any of these situations that make it much more difficult for people to self actualize well what I think they'd argue is they don't hear you talk about that very much well it isn't first of all it's not self-evident like I'm not I don't accept Maslow's hierarchy of needs I don't think it's necessarily more difficult for people who are poor to self-actualize sorry I don't buy that he's because what that would mean think about what that would mean that would mean that the rich are morally superior that's what that means because they have all the opportunities to self actualize so obviously if the material conditions are the prerequisite for self-actualization then the rich are morally superior to the poor is that really an argument we want to make and then in fact I don't think that that's even even vaguely reasonable because one of the things that does help build character is privation now obviously starving to death is an an excess of privation so there are limit conditions but the it's a leftist trope that the provision of additional material resources will produce ethically superior human beings sorry not true and in fact sometimes quite the contrary so so so I don't I don't I don't buy that argument in the least I also think that under most circumstances in accepting those of exceptional privation and even perhaps under those conditions in most is in most cases your best bet to move people forward is to concentrate on the development of their individual character and their individual their individual moral character fund because moral character is actually your moral character is actually the set of tools that you have to operate effectively in the world because otherwise morality would be of no utility and morality is in some sense precisely that wit which is of maximal utility and so and and the other objection that I would throw it at the radical left is how do you know that your your emphasis on collective existence isn't just an abdication of your personal responsibility well of course it's not it's like no no no seriously here it's not that easy to add or personal responsibility maximal personal responsibility what makes you think you're not running away from it you have every reason to you really have that stellar moral character really that's that's your self analysis sorry I don't buy it and I especially don't buy it when I look at the consequences of leftist revolutions because all these people of stellar moral character when they undertake their collectivist revolution nothing comes out of that but absolute bloody catastrophe so so all the well-meaning aims aside my my sense of a lot of the progressive people that I know is that they're not they're sort of from a new generation they're not generally materialist that they're sort of very spiritually aware and I i sense a kind of implicit message in what you're saying that I'd never heard made explicitly that in some sense materialism is a deadening doctrine I mean you look at the opioid crisis and America you look at a lot of these if poverty is seen as a more sort of also also as a sort of spiritual crisis or a spot of crisis of the soul as much as anything else is it mostly that like it'd be a lovely ring if if poverty was caused by lack of money mmm we could fix it really easily there but my point I think is to say that if if you were framing your message in that way I think there would be a lot of people on the left who'd be receptive to that message sort of that that actually there is a crisis of that the crisis of already call it like world view has real consequences and a lot of poverty we're seeing in the world is to do with this kind of materialist worldview that has become become corrupt or at least kind of stripped all of the meaning and purpose oh yeah well that's a good point well right well I mean I don't believe that materialism materialist hedonism is a sufficient solution now it's a bit more complicated than that because I do think that functional democratic systems are actually pretty good at reasonable hedonism like I'm pretty happy that our system produces a variety of toothpastes and a variety of toilet papers and a variety of sanitary napkins all of these things that that are basically oriented towards what would you call them individual creature comforts there's something about that that's really merciful and properly egalitarian and so a certain degree of material hedonism is a good thing right because it's nice that people can have their basic needs taken care of in a dignified manner but as a as a ultimate solution to the problems of life its insufficient which is again why I don't really like Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs you know it isn't it isn't a progression up the moral chain because of the provision of additional material resources doesn't work that way that doesn't mean that you don't want to you want to set up a situation where as many people as possible are absent the terrible strictures of privation but we are doing that quite rapidly thank god so so I think we're the leftists are less happy with what I'm doing is the case that I'm making that the meaning that transcends mere materialism is to be found in the adoption of individual responsibilities because I wouldn't say that that's a core message certainly not of the radical left it's not that at all because generally they construe the individual as either the oppressor or the suffering oppressed but not as the active agent as either of those active agents the problem with the oppressor oppress narrative is even though there's an element of truth to it each of us can be subdivided into so many group identities that there's at least one dimension along which we're all oppressors and that's actually when I've been looking at what happened in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution that was the bloody error so to speak because you could take virtually ever any individual and you could find out it's like if there's one dimension of your identity that makes you an oppressor that trumps all the elements of your identity where you're a victim and the problem with that is there is one element of your identity where you're an oppressor and so that's sufficient justification to throw you in with the Predators and do whatever is necessary to dispense with you and that is exactly what happened in the aftermath while not only of the Russian Revolution but all of these radical leftist revolutions it's like well if you're a socialist while you're not sufficiently pure from a doctrinaire perspective and if you're a student well then you're part of the emerging burgeois class and if your parents were reasonably what would you say efficient farmers then you're part of the kulaks and like it just went on and on and on and on there wasn't anybody who escaped from the from being tarred with the brush of oppressor and that's because that is because each of us are in fact oppressors and oppressed every single person shares both of those things in common so um got a couple of minutes left so this might be quite a big question but just come back from the US where we interview Paul van der play Christian pastor who's been doing quite a lot of videos about your your thought he one of his questions was he says he he sees a real sort of stoicism in your thought so pick up your cross and drag it up the hill his question is what's at the top of the hill he said here thought well that's because he hasn't listened to the times when I've been talking about it I guess because I've said it repeatedly you stumble uphill with your burden towards the City of God that's the that's the story does that mean the City of God do you I would say that that's that's a place where everyone bears maximum responsibility and speaks the truth that's what it is and what's the responsibility you're responsible for the suffering in the world you're responsible for the malevolence in the world and you're responsible for the veracity of your utter insanity of God you're maximally responsible for the suffering you're maximally responsible for the malevolence and you speak the truth that's what it is very concise so you can tell paul van der clay that that's great Jordan thank you very much my pleasure nice to see you again you [Music]
