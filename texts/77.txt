you've known Jordan Peterson since before kind of at all of the rest of us kind of got to know him I guess yeah it was a strange he was a kind of strange coincidence of events I met him in 2015 or I I heard of him in 2015 and then I I connected with him about six months before the whole thing started to kind of fall apart explode and my it was trained because when I met him when I heard him I felt like IKEA he understood the types of things that I was asking myself like the types of questions about how reality exists and about symbolism and so when we met I felt like there was one thing I had to tell him it was so weird because we we right away we could see that we could we could understand each other and there was I just felt like there was one message I needed to communicate to him which was because he talked about this notion of the monster on the edge of the world and the idea of the dragon and chaos kind of on the edge of reality but III I felt like I had to kind of tell them that that monster also exists between categories like it so it's not just that it exists on the edge of something but that the world exists in this hierarchy of levels let's say and at the edge of each rung of the hierarchy or also in between opposites there is a buffer of of chaos and which kind of protects the which both which can both threaten but also protects the integrity of identities right so you need a kind of a buffer of exceptions a buffer of things that don't quite fit on the edges of things because that's that's what helps you kind of like we say the exception is the rule right it helps you to see the identity but it it if you're not careful it can actually start to eat at the the identities and so I was trying to explain like that's what that's why we have cherubim you know in the temple between the holy place and the Holy of Holies in the holy and that's why we have we have guardians on the outside of holy places right that act as this kind of buffer of chaos and we talked about also the idea of the the threshold in a lot of cultures you're not supposed to step on the threshold if you if you enter someone's house you have to step over the threshold like the step on the threshold is that is considered a very dangerous thing and it has to do with this idea that there is no definite place where the inside and the outside of an of a house is right you couldn't say right here like this spot where I'm showing this is exactly the place where the house house and the outside and inside are because it's not something about quantifiable it's not quantifiable but there is a difference and so the threshold acts as this buffer of chaos which is neither inside or outside don't touch it leave it alone you know let the monster be just just step across it and then you're on the inside and you know you're on the inside so that's what I kind of felt like I had to talk to him about and Jenny was so strange that it was that it ended up being this this like idea of identities that aren't quite don't quite fit into the normal male outfield female opposite that's what exploded on the first show exactly and so he ended up well it's more that the threshold started to manifest itself like it's like the monsters which are in a way supposed to protect the identities such a turn on the inside has started to devour the categories you know you see that in a lot of stories where like I talked about the idea of the troll in the bridge right so the troll on the bridge he protects he stops you from crossing right he's there to prevent things that aren't supposed to cross the cross but then he can also start to give how're things like he can start to actually eat at those things that want to cross over and so it's a it's like that's the ambiguity of the of the margin so anyway so I felt like I'd explained that so then after that when the Pepe thing kind of came about then I knew that okay we need to talk about this and then since then like I feel I feel like Jordan he kind of he's kind of seen me as an ally in certain things like not everything that he does but in certain things that he does and so he'll call me usually very frantic you know because he he thought of some crazy connection and he can't you couldn't say publicly because it would just look insane if you just said it publicly but you just need someone to bounce it off and so then we'll talk it out and and so so that's kind of been my my relationship with Jordan so when you explain that thing to him was this something he had thought of before or was it completely new I think it's one of those things where he hadn't thought about it explicitly but as soon as I said it it was like right he clicked right away it fit right away into the way he sees the world and and that's kind of I think that's what happens with symbolism to some of the things that he says it does the same to me where I hadn't quite thought of it in those categories but as soon as he says it it just kind of right away you know intuitively that it's right and so that was the that was kind of the relationship that they developed right away and then after that it felt like that's always been kind of our discussion is that he'll say something then I'll say something we're both kind of like whoa you know look like two stoners you know kind of discovering the the world and so it's it's it's a lot of fun that's for sure yeah so that's how that's and then when it happened I think obviously when it happened to him then it really became real you know and so he started to see this whole idea of the of chaos in that way as a the idea of also this notion of deconstructing like how post-modernism also plays a role that's similar because that's what Jacques Derrida that's all he talked about was how these indeterminate categories they can deconstruct the categories if you play with them in the right way they can turn on normal opposites and-and-and actually kind of not invalidate but like make the normal category start to slip and then you can't nothing nothing is stable anymore that's good that's kind of how we feel like things are going on right now like the world is kind of in that that weird space right now so I wonder if there's some of the ambivalence that I see and sense with Christians and Jordan Peterson because one he doesn't identify himself as a Christian but he's also explaining Christian stories in a way sort of using the psychological mainly is there a sense that in a way he's he's sort of potentially explaining them away for some Christians like in a way if you've explained them why do you need belief and faith in the same way how do you how do you see the the relationship between sort of traditional Christianity and what Jordan Peterson is offering yeah I think I keep thing is obviously not a Christian like I even said like Jordan is obviously a heretic like he's a lot of the things he says are completely wild but I think that I think that the way that he's talking about things I think the way that he's talking about about these stories first of all it's not that new it's it's only new it's only new for kind of weird literalists type Christians in the United States and in North America especially but it but it's not weird at all for traditional Christians because this idea that there are first of all different levels of meaning in the text is very traditional and so this notion also that the the Old Testament is there to show us certain moral structure than kind of ways of interacting that can teach us lessons about how to live our lives I mean that's obviously very that's very traditional I think that Jordan has found a way to talk about it using neuropsychology using the psychology of attention using also evolutionary biology that is definitely surprising people because he's able to connect you know research in psychology to to to how the stories lay that some play themselves out and I think that that's been really fascinating for people um and and I think what I've always said is I think that the fact that Jordan is not Christian is actually extremely helpful right now because would start listening to the media said that he was yeah exactly it's like it's like I it's like I I say explicitly that I'm a Christian like it's part of my upfront identity and because of that I know that there's a there's a limit to how many people are going to listen to what I'm saying I've accepted that like it's something that I decided to do and I've accepted it like because he's he's a he's acting as this weird kind of in-between figure he he doesn't he's not threatening to people they don't they don't feel like he's gonna try to convert them like they they feel like the discussion that he's having is honest and genuine and he's actually trying to work this stuff out and the truth is he really is trying to work this stuff out Jordan hasn't when Jordan says when he doesn't answer the question like you believe in the resurrection of Christ if when he doesn't answer the question do you believe in God it's because he's really is trying to figure it out for himself he's not he's not it's not a it's not a theater move that he's doing like he he you know I had up I had a discussion with Jordan just a few weeks ago where he he called me and we started talking about about Genesis again and attention and this hierarchy of attention and everything and how how God gathering the dust and blowing his spirit into the dust is the same structure as how we basically encounter the world like we gather in this potentiality then we infuse meaning into it and he was like and then he said something he said he said Oh said it's so terrifying to think that these stories could actually be true like what do you mean what do you mean it's it's terrifying he said well what do we do what do we do if they're true you know and so it's like Jordan is actually he actually is working through this stuff he's not pretending and I think that's one of the reasons why people have been so genuinely interested in what he's saying he's no different in private than he is in public like this is what's happening I think that the Christians most of the Christians that I've reacted negatively to him have been the kind of Calvinist types that the kind of the more rigid are you saved are you not saved like that kind of Christian I think they're the ones who have been reacting more to him I think that most other people have just accepted that he personally he's not a Christian he's not saying he's a Christian and and he's just there I always talk about him as as a kind of uh as a transitional figure he said I always say that he's like King Cyrus King Cyrus in the Bible he he's the one who sent the Israelites back to build their temple like he wasn't any is he wasn't in his real light he didn't believe in God like he he had all these idols and he and he he was he was a man of you know a powerful man but because he he was a then because of that he was the one who was able to say like hey you know why don't you go back in that temple that you had you know it's there's something interesting there was it interesting you you should do that you should go back like go back to your thing and because of that there have been I mean I've been witnessing to myself like there are thousands of people that are going to church like at least at least hundreds of people have written me personally emails talking about how they're kind of rediscovering their Christian faith at a different level they kind of move past the the 13 year old version of Christianity and they discovered something more more powerful and I keep telling them like that's what Christianity is it's all that's always what it's been maybe not obviously not the evolutionary biology so because they didn't talk about that stuff but the notion that these that these stories manifest these ways of being and these these manners of encountering the world and that it has to do with consciousness and has to do with our or our experience of the world like that there's no mystery like that's really what what it's about you know so you can you can easily go back to church and then and then discover that now it doesn't mean that when you go back to church you're only going to encounter people who who understand that religion is a hierarchy like the way it's set up is the hierarchy it's it's there the way the stories are told there they're supposed to be able to engage and touch the dumbest peasant right and at the same time engage and touch the scholar the the scholar of religion the philosopher okay but you can't expect everybody to have the same level of understanding so if you go to a church you're going to encounter someone who has a very direct very literal very kind of in-your-face vision of what those stories are about and you shouldn't be surprised about that because that's for everybody to fit it's like the saying the sam harris version of religion he would be able to enlighten everybody so that everybody understood the higher meaning of religion and nobody was attached to their like the kind of more immediate lower version of of a believing stuff and it's like that's not gonna happen some people are never going to reach that some people are never going to reach that level it's impossible you the reason we're talking is you go in touch with me to talk about organized religion which is a subject I'm really interested to hear your thoughts it's a kind of a common the kind of common story for the last few generations in the West I grew up in a Protestant kind of Baptist background very very conservative I would say like a you know conservative thinking a lot of creationism all that stuff luckily my father was a very intelligent person he was a pastor actually for a part of my youth and he was very he's very curious and very intelligent person you always encourage inquiry and encourage deeper thinking so the the whatever fundamentalism I was getting was mostly getting it from my surrounding not not necessarily for my family but I kind of had to say in university I started asking a lot of questions and I started seeing the limits let's say of where I was coming from and I started to discover the same as you I started to read texts from Eastern traditions from read more you know kind of Gnostic type text and I thought okay what I could understand what they're talking about like what they're talking about this this transformation of the person that salvation the way was presented to me as a as a child that's there as a young person was you believe in Jesus right you leave in Jesus and then you're saved so it was like believe in Jesus and you get this ticket you know you die you go to heaven like yeah I then I read the Mystics and I realize okay that's not what it's about but that's not exactly what it's talking about it is talking about this transformation of the person and the notion of ascending into heaven it is it's a transformation of the person to become to be free from the let's say the things that hold us down like our passions and and you know our belly and all those things that kind of hold us back and our thoughts all of that needs to kind of to fall away and then to enter into that silence let's say that the inner silence and the this uh this transcendent place that we can find in our heart and that God can interact with us so I was like okay that's awesome and but at first I thought at first I thought okay well why is it that it doesn't why is it that I find this in reading you know Hindu texts or reading Gnostic texts or reading kind of weird weird text but it's not in Christianity why you know why is that the case and then I realized that it was in Christianity it's just that no one had ever taught me those those traditions and then I discovered the church father and I discovered the the mystical Christian tradition hesychasm especially the the tradition of the east that's when I discovered st. gregory of nyssa and some maximus the confessor and gregory palamas this whole line of mystical teachers that that are in the Orthodox tradition and that led me finally to convert to orthodoxy where everything is seen through that mystical lens and so the whole purpose of everything we do even all the rules that we have they're not just simple moral rules of you should do this you shouldn't do that but they're they're just basically tools to help you move into your heart and encounter Christ and be illuminated by Christ and so that was kind of my my past and in that I discovered the symbolic language and and how the symbolic language had to do with this notion of I talked about kind of entering the heart in terms of a person but you can do that in terms of of your experience of the world so the world actually comes together and starts to shine like things start to be brighter than they were before as you see things come together in in in the logo so you could say like I think people who are listening to you will now start to know with that that means it's not just gobbledygook right and so that that's kind of what led me to to where I am and so for me the discovery for me in terms of organized religion I think that in order for all the levels to be stacked up properly you know because you one of the things that is still accessible to most people today is this idea of the personal mystical experience right but the difficulty with that personal mystical experience is that if it's proper right it also has to to stack at the the next level and it also has to bring communities together ready can't just be on an individual level because it it has to line up with the way the world exists and so if you if you if you start to have let's say intuitions mystical intuitions or you start to have that process of getting rid of these passions that you have and kind of moving in then that also needs to happen at the communal level and then it has to have it it has to have a social equivalent or else it's not real it's not totally real so I think that that's why for me in the end there had to be a religious aspect to it religious and really in the sense of a place where you go and you are in communion with other people the same way that you're able to commune your thoughts together in your heart you have to rep that has to happen again at a social level and ideally it has to happen at a kind of universal level where those churches also are communion with other churches and that kind of creates this body which is in Christianity called the body of Christ it's kind of this this cosmic body you could say where everything kind of comes together and so it's like I think that we can do that we can kind of engage in in Christianity in the body of Christ without being naive right without being naive in not understanding that just like in myself I have all these things pulling me in all these directions that I have all these crazy thoughts that I have all these crazy desires that I have different personalities sometimes it manifests themselves and I start to act in these weird patterns so - on a social level you have the same problem you have perversions that set themselves up you have power struggles etcetera something all this stuff happens at at the church level and so I think it's it's incumbent on us not to be naive about it not also to just accept it but also not to be scandalized by the fact that that happened because if it happens in me it's gonna happen at the other level - like I'm not I'm not you know I'm not fully illuminated let's say I don't know if that makes sense yeah I I feel the first bit you were saying about sort of the transformational aspect of of the experience is something I resonate with because I've done a lot of personal growth work which I now feel like I understand at a deeper level because I'm now framing it within okay the more I speak my I speak my truth the more align myself with the logos the more the more I simplify my being in some way the more I kind of have this and able to live that out in my own life and I mean able to frame a lot of the work that I've done which was probably offered more within a new agey kind of framework within a slightly deeper cut much deeper Christian framework yeah but I also Paul Van de clay said that you were quite skeptical about Jung because because I would say Jung maps on to that sort of transformational aspect of of growth and and religious experience I think you know it's weird I keep telling you I haven't really read Jung that much like I've read a little bit of Jung that everybody's read when they're in college or whatever like I haven't really studied Jung very much I think that the reason why I hadn't I had never studied Jung is that I feel like he he he makes what he Key's kind of like Jordan it's worried because I it's like it's like I like Jordan because I know him and we like he comes up to the psychological level and then he kind of stopped there but maybe I'm wrong that's the feeling that I get is that I feel like the step after Jung is to realize that that is really how reality is in an objective way that is like you know you see for example Jordan does this thing like he did this thing this I'm here debates where he talks about the spirit of the father coming up like this notion of the Spirit of the father being kind of elected by the people who elect to hide the sense of the leader and then that keeps going and going going and that comes up and then we have this image of the Father and heaven right and then it's like that's it that's yeah that's right that's right that's right but then at some point you have to realize it that's the reason why that happened because that's actually the shape of reality like you were not we're not separate from reality okay we're not separate from that process like that process it in order to for it to to have happened in - to persist like it has to manifest something about the real world like it has to manifest something about about how reality is structure and so then for me it's like then you can to me it's not a then it becomes not a problem to say I can say my father our Father who is in heaven and I and I can just say that I don't have to do all the psychological work behind like I don't have to kind of convince myself about all these steps about how the spirit of the father merged out of all these different that it's like I can just say our Father was in heaven and I know that that's the truest way to encounter the the infinite power let's say the the the infinity of of generation of the of the infinite generating person and I can I can say that so to me it's I always felt like young kind of stopped there and I think that one of the problems I had with young too is I think I felt like he was it's not his fault totally he was in the 19th century early 20th century occult like the kind of occult thinking where it was really it was that strong sense of Christians got it wrong Christians didn't understand what they were doing it's like here I'm gonna show you like what it really was and also that's why I kind of get hung up on Gnosticism it's like you'll know so did that she was like oh the Gnostics got it right the Christians got it wrong and then here we are you know poor us we where like if the Gnostics had had one like we'd be so more in light so much more enlightened think that that I think that's that's that's the wrong way to go about it and I think that it's subversive in the end that it actually ends up I think that young in in the manner to which he acted that way he he participated in the the fragmentation of the social fabric let's say of the West in in trying to because we see it if you want to know the way to destroy Christianity we've seen it happen in the past 10 years where every year there's some new weird fragment of text that they find in the desert and then they tell us here's this new fragment like it's revealing us the real truth about about Jesus that we've ignored for the past thousand years if only we had had this this weird fragment that we found somewhere in underground in the desert like we would now have the all the wisdom and and I think that that's a that's a subversive element it's really there to constantly break apart what the could the social cohesion so that's that says that was my problem with young but you know III had to be fair like I haven't read I haven't read enough young to to be and that's why I haven't actually never I've never been openly critical about you neither I've always kind of distanced myself from him but I'd never been openly critical about him because I don't know enough about him to to really be able to say even I probably what I've already said might be wrong because I know what I know for secondary sources and stuff I guess you're you're saying it's kind of all was like explaining Christianity away and rather than explaining Christianity that is that your sense I know I would i I don't know if it's explaining it away it's like I think it's it's it's um you know a it's a kind of it's a kind of sign it I don't know if it's a kind of sign to somebody it's a kind of it's a kind of manner to say that reductionism if we can find the psychological mechanisms by which these things happen then we don't need the the metaphysical let's say instead of seeing that the psychological structure is manifesting the structure of reality right it's it's it's it's mirroring the structure of reality so reductionism would be a better maybe that's a way to see it yeah maybe that would be a way to say it which is sort of what the materialist day by saying well it's just it's just chemicals what it's just by it's just it so that's what there's no need for the word just in that like yes it is chemicals but how is that not necessarily representing another reality or another reality and that all of these realities are stacked its other gamma it's a judgment of what you're making your primary lens and then assuming everything else is is should be seen through that lens rather than saying well there are multiple levels and there and things are manifesting at all of them yeah because we don't we don't experience love as a bunch of chemicals in our brain if you do yeah like it's you in trouble we experience love in the realm of language and consciousness and relationship and and and and if you try to reduce that to the chemicals in your brain you're not doing justice to the experience of that you're you're and and you know I I think that that if it brings us back to the discussion about Sam Harris a we had that we had before where there's a there's a podcast where he talked with it I forget who it was yet a podcast about this notion of house reality stacks like how you know emergent they call emergent phenomena right how how things come together into identities right at higher because it's not just a quantum field like we don't just experience it but in the end it is just a quantum field right it is just in terms of material substrate it's just a quantum field and so but then how do these different levels of reality stack on each other and Sam kept wanting to he's kept saying I want to explain it with the lowest common possible thing but that doesn't make sense because you know like millions and billions like there's millions of atoms in your hand and there's no point in explaining it with those millions of atoms instead of explaining it with the deer like I'm thirsty I'm going to drink a glass of water explaining it through the realm of consciousness and I think that that's yeah that's that's that's the thing is that just because you find the material causes of something does it mean that you've eliminated the higher realities I think I think it's to me it's so obvious but I guess a lot of people aren't able to see it but it to me it's so obvious like I can both say that the music that I like comes from my my iPod you know but also comes from I don't know like Kanye West or whatever like it and and I can also say that Kanye West is manifesting you know certain immutable patterns of relationships that make it so that I can like that music and so it's like I don't have to eliminate I don't have to say well I know I discovered the secret of music it's coming from my earphones I've got I've got it you dumb people who think the music particles exactly it's like so you dumb people who think that music has meaning it's like it's all moving particles yeah I could just imagine a music review page that was just like every single every single album was it's just moving particles different way to the other ones exactly and it's and certain chemicals in your brain have been we were able to see which section in your brain doesn't is is is active yeah the problem is that that's what you find I mean that's what you find in at least a lot of the people that I've encountered that are so against religion you know they say things like God doesn't exist and and I think well you know what if you think that exists means that you can hold it in your hand you can touch it and feel it then yes God doesn't exist fine I'm totally fine with that like if you think that if you even if you think that it means that you can contain it even conceptually then yeah God doesn't exist right because God the whole idea of God in the in the Christian tradition and in all the monotheistic traditions is that God is uncontainable that God is beyond all concept all name all representation and that not that the representations are arbitrary that they help you to kind of get closer to to the to the mystery but that but that that God is not a thing right and so it's really hard to argue with an atheist who wants you to prove that God exists like he wants you like he wants you to prove that you know that that that tree has fallen in the forest like you can't it's not the same kind of proof even existentialism starts from that perspective of realizing the language we are using cannot encapsulate the thing we're trying to explain yeah this is everything by definition language is going to be a subset of it any representation of everything is going to be a subset of everything yeah therefore it cannot it cannot be articulated yeah but I think that the proper way to see it at least at least like in it from the Orthodox perspective we have this idea we have these two visions of theology when it's called apophatic theology and catyph Attic theology an apathetic theology means this denial right this saying that that that God is beyond all name all definition right that you cannot encompass the divine in in language and images and whatever but then the other aspect is that because of that everything actually does manifest the divine right so one of the problems people have one of the problems we've seen in post-modernism especially is that they'll have this apathetic move well they'll say something like you can't represent reality reality is beyond our capacity to represent it and then they make this weird move where they say therefore it's all arbitrary right all their structures are arbitrary our social structures are constructed they're all arbitrary but that's not the red move the red move is then to see that actually all of reality then flow out of that mystery and actually points in a very fragmented way but points towards that unsaid mystery and so that's what lays out the hierarchy right that's what lays out the hierarchy of being is is both those moves where you say it's something beyond but then everything is manifesting that beyond and it's kind of its kind of flowing out of it and that that that's what helps that it helps avoid it helps avoid the absurd aspect of existentialism in my in my opinion at least I'd love to ask you because I heard the interviewed Paul van der clay recently and he he said something along these lines I think after the interview that it all comes down to the resurrection that and I think he may have sent me a quote I may have seen a quote that said if the resurrection didn't happen then every Christian is a fool or something like that do you want do you understand what that means from a from a theological perspective I mean yeah I think I think therefore sure that the Christianity hinges on the resurrection hmm I think that's for sure I I I think that how can I say this I keep telling people to be a little bit careful when people think that they know what the resurrection is I don't think it's that easy to to know what the resurrection is I always tell people I believe the resurrection is an event and I and and I think that the text describes that event both in a very experiential way that the people who were there experienced experience the resurrection in an in a very extreme way the tomb was empty you know there were these encounters but it's it's also not that simple it's not as because people people think that the resurrection just means a dead body sitting up and walking out like that's not how it's described in the text Christ hides himself in the resurrection so after the resurrection Christ manifests himself to to these people and they don't recognize him and it takes a long time before they actually recognize Christ in his resurrection and so I think that that that in the story it's important to see that it was deliberately put in the story that whatever the resurrection is is not is not obvious it's not an obvious thing and and sometimes people who want to reduce the resurrection to some kind of some kind of resuscitation right like some kind of someone passing out and you do CPR on them and then they sit up in the Nick off out you know their whether it's in their lungs or whatever like I think that that is an it is a very that's a very naive way of seeing it and some people can see it that way it's fine but I think that we shouldn't reduce it to that we should be careful not to reduce it to that but I do agree that the resurrection is the hinge of Christianity and the resurrection has to do with the idea that the world is essentially can participate in God that's what the resurrection means direction means that the created world the manifest world the the world of phenomena can embody can be a house for the infinite and can manifest the infinite and so it redeems the world right it makes the world participate in in in divinity and so if you look at the the last image in the in in Revelations like you follow the whole story the last image in Revelations I think I keep telling people that's the image to you help you to see what the result of the resurrection is in the end and it's this it's the the New Jerusalem the heavenly Jerusalem and what it is it's a it's a garden in the middle the Garden of Eden in the middle and then the city around it and the city is made glorious right it's gold and jewels and everything so it's it's represented in a glorious manner and so both the natural world the natural world contained but then also all of human activity all of technology all of human knowledge all of the extra building that that consciousness can do and the body right the the the actual physical world can be can participate can be can be transformed can be full of light right can can be transfigured how I don't know how else you want to say and so and so that that has repercussions which go beyond which go beyond our our very immediate experience of the world like how does that link to the mystical experience because what you're describing is a mystical experience it's the same thing it's exactly the same thing so if you look at the same resurrection the idea that the mystical experience of oneness transcendence kind of the world glowing from within interacts with the world in a real way that's right it's exactly what it is and that's exactly what it is it so when you when you read the the Saint when you read several of the mystics they talk about how the resurrection is accessible already that we can already participate in the resurrection of the body that it's not that it is something which is at the end right and it's important that it's at the end because it encompasses everything and so it happens at the end of the world at the end of history at the end of you know time whatever you want to say because it is the final thing it's the thing that encompasses everything so you could see it as encompassing the whole world but you can see it also as encompassing all of time and so that's why it's important that it's represented eschatologically that it's represented in the future in the final revelation let's say but what it is the cosmic participation in the the mystics experience it is a cosmic version of what the mystic experiences in his illumination and that's exactly what it is in that in and I could say that without a hint of worry that any at least orthodox theologian is gonna come in and slap me on the wrist because that's really what what what it is it also sounds pretty psychedelic I don't know I'm not I've never done psychedelic so I don't I I know or the the the traditional versions of this so I don't know about the psychedelic one I'm just I guess I've discovered like this world is psychedelic with Jordan he always kind of sometimes he kind of freaks me out when he when he thought he tells me things like he's I had this vision and he told me his vision it's funny because his visions are always quite coherent simple luckily you know and so I can I can't a like oh it's connected to this is this like you can show them what it's connected to but it's just funny to think that they're due to mushroom so it's gonna kind of like it's weird was the was there anything that we we haven't discussed yet you'd like to to cover I don't know I I think I maybe I'd like to kind of hear your take or your vision let's say of what are the challenges or the the opportunities of organized religion like what do you think are the problems and what you think or how could you see it at negative and positive terms let's say I mean it's clear that the the absence of a space and a reason to to come together is is something that's really we're really lacking in society a friend of mine created something called Sunday assembly I don't know if you've heard about it's a it was an atheist church or is an atheist Church so he's a stand-up comic and together with another stand-up comic friend of that his they they was like well why do why do only people come together for religious things why can't we create this is an atheist Church and the interesting thing is like I don't think I'm speaking out of turn for him here is that they they created as an atheist church and it's become more and more spiritual as times gone on like they've it's developed its own kind of they realized how insufficient atheism was as a kind of organizing principle for a community to come together right and it sort of developed a little bit more of a kind of spiritual tone as times gone on but I certainly feel in myself that that lack of an organizing principle and that just there's also something about like I went to Paul van der clays service in sacramento quite recently what I realized is my think this is something to do with our tribalism we need we need a context to be able to let our guard down there's a sense that when we all go to church together because we all tacitly acknowledge that we have the same value system but we have the same objectives that we have for the same reason it allows you to talk to anyone there like you immediately drop the bat drop the barriers where there's all in pretty much every other social situation apart from maybe a festival like a really good festival and not that doesn't always happen we always have these boundaries between us and them we need something to allow us to to connect with others we need an excuse so we need a context so that's what I think for me that's what I realized when I went to Paul's church was oh okay wherever you come from you can go into one of maybe an AAA meeting might give you the same experience like we all we need this shared context to be able to get over our our yeah our innate tribalism I think and that's what for me I recognized and I don't know whether it's possible to have that without I think you'd have to have a religious framework of some kind for that or a shared a shared value system of some kind I don't know whether you're sort of suggesting that we need a renewal of traditional Christianity or traditional religion and I I kind have some sympathy with that but I also have a sense that probably for my generation and younger if there is something that that kind of fills that spiritual void that we're all feeling that it's probably going to look somewhat different from from what we've seen before hmm yeah I mean it'll be interesting to see how yeah how how it works out I kind of I think that I kind of see it in the long in a long term like I see it in a long story and so I already see let's say to me that the the Reformation for me was already kind of a problem in terms of what it did to the west it's like I think we're the product of this kind of breakdown I think one of the difficulties is when when the highest value that is that a society has turned towards when that starts to change like tries to fragment you can maybe hold on to the you can maybe hold on to the smaller communities because we still we have those small communities right I mean we have you kids like you said it could be an a a meeting it could just be a knitting group it could be an old ladies who go get together to knit right they have a common thing which unites them and makes them into a little community and I but I think that in order for larger in order for like that say all of society to have some form of capacity to interact there need we needs to agree on the highest let's say or at least work as hard as possible to agree on the highest and I think that that's what I think that's what the church offered let's say the West for you know like a thousand years let's say and and it was actually the only thing like in Western Europe was Western Europe was so dark and so convoluted and there was all these wars and all these barbarians coming down and everything the only thing that made it even to something like that made it somehow one was the was was the fact that we could at least all kind of agree you know this is what we're aiming to you know then the Incarnation is at least what we aim towards so I think that I mean it's probably idealistic for me to think that that's what we would need like something that's why I tended to to return to to more traditional Christianity but it's we're in a difficult situation for sure i I think I fear I think I fear that those smaller communities that we that there's going to happen it's gonna happen again like it happened in in the 20th century hopefully not as bad but that's what nationalism was right we can't agree on the highest on the highest unity and so are the one we can find that solid is our national identity so we kind of clumped around our national identities and then we had these crazy wars that you know that were there were nuts and so I feel like in the wake of World War Two as we you know it's just been two generations I was said like the last one the last veteran of World War two dies the last people that survived World War two it's gonna happen again because we haven't dealt with anything we haven't dealt with any of the questions that were being posed at that time so I think I have the same sense it's like also some Sun lessons after we learn the hard way like if you gotta have a lived experience of how bad things can get then it's very difficult to kind of even even think or articulate it to yourself yeah well let's hope let's hope cuz this one this this turn is gonna have artificial intelligence in it think about it too much I think that to me I think that that participating in something which has the possibility of of kind of uniting things together I think to me that's been my drive back towards traditional Christianity so but I mean like I'm Orthodox I'm not Catholic so I'm also somehow participating in this weird this weird kind of fragmentation you know like at the same time I feel like there's a lot of things in Catholicism which are which are off and so and I think orthodoxy has more of that mystical vision that I that I did I think is important to have as the central core like if you you have the mystical vision as a central core then then the world flows out you know in them in a more ordered way I think
