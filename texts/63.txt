[Music] on the surface Douglas Murray's recent bestseller the strange death of Europe was a reaction to the migrant crisis of 2015 where he spent months at Europe's borders interviewing migrants natives and policy makers but in it he argues that the migrant crisis and Europeans reaction to it is another symptom of a broader spiritual crisis a crisis of meaning and a sense that the story has run out at a fundamental level so in a strange death of Europe you say how long can a society survive once it unmoored itself from its founding source and drive yes it is quite reminiscent like Jordan Peterson has soared to public consciousness over the last couple of years with a very very similar message do you think this is something that a lot of people are now waking up to once they're waking up to I think they're intuiting it I think have been for a long time and as I said it takes a little bit of time to be willing to sort of voice it because it's as I said not just you may be wrong and it's embarrassing to be wrong on such a big thing but it's not so much that as well what are you going to do about it I try to just diagnose where I think we are I'm not particularly prescriptive of what I think happens now I've got various instincts about it but I think that that unmooring and more illness is I'm not also not the only person to have pointed it out there are problems about pointing it out because a lot of people don't want to accept the premise that I'm saying there that we that we've divorced ourselves and the ways in which we've got where we have because they think it's a way to open up the door for religion to come back in or unpleasant forms of religion to come back in or very prescriptive forms of religion to come back in or they think you might be doing something else there all sorts of motives you could ascribe to anyone pointing this out something you're you're up to secretly behind the scenes and I think those are just among some of the reasons why people are wary about allowing that conversation to begin because where will it take us and I'm into that one my own answer is I don't know I think it's probably worth it's probably worth risking it with our eyes as wide open as possible rather than pretending it away but yes there are the people who've you've noticed similar things doubtless others you could name from Nietzsche onwards yeah I mean Nietzsche foresaw a lot of this as did various others I mean occasionally I get it happened recently in and in a BBC interview about Oswald Spengler the centenary of publication of his great masterwork and an interviewer said well you know Spangler said some of what you're saying a hundred years ago I said well you know there's there's no inevitability to the idea that civilizations become unmoored and then die or crash within say a four or five year parliamentary term you know these things may take a lot of time the second thing is that as it were the most positive interpretation of what I am saying and the most positive interpretation of the fact that some other people have said some of it before the most positive interpretation you could take from that would be to say well maybe it's the case that we're often having bad diagnoses like this as it were almost terminal diagnosis and yet we survived and therefore maybe and this is this is it were the most positive point that you could make against what I'm saying maybe in that case premature or possibly premature diagnosis of our own mortality as civilizations maybe something that keeps us healthy could be it's not such a bad thing to bear in mind but I mean that's that's the best-case scenario of course in the debates with Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson you said we may be in the midst of discovering that the only thing worse than religion is its absence yes is this a little bit I'm reminded of GK Chesterton's idea that if a man stops believing in God he starts believing in anything is what you're saying there that we we have the capacity for very fundamentalist ways of looking at the world and we will attach them to anything part of what we're going through at the moment is the discovery that we don't have very much to hold on to and by that I mean among other things that we can no longer even agree on facts seems this is worse in some countries and others I'd have thought at this stage in its development America has this worst but as the Irish journalist Kevin Myers said a few years ago something I'm fond of quoting he said in his memoir watching the door he described a moment where he said the truth had become whatever you were having yourself now we are we are reaching a similar stage it seems to me certainly Morocco is already at that stage you can you can see it everyone nobody can agree on what's true nobody can even agree on what's happened not just historically where everyone has now got their own view of history regarding their own political side but also what happened today even today's facts are disputed and not as if they ever reach a conclusion now they just they just go off in different directions and and I think that that is a version of what I'm that's a part of what I'm trying to say when I say that that we may be discovering that the only thing worse than religion is its absence is that the people seem to be finding it extremely hard and I don't absolve myself from by the way I'm not saying that I sit in some unique position where I don't suffer from this I think we all do to some extent but I think people are finding it very hard to know what it is you do hold on to what you can hold on to what art but is another way fixed certainties now religion in among many other things provides people erroneously we may think but with fixed certainties for instance the biggest of which is some kind of cosmic idea of justice and a watered down version of which we imbibe in our societies today what is it that the rug on the floor of the Oval Office said but in the arc of human history is long but it tends towards justice there's not a lot of evidence for that rug being true but it's a wonderful idea and probably hard to live entirely without religion provides among other things that idea it gives you the idea that if not now then in a future world you will see justice and it's a wonderful idea and there are many smaller concepts which religion probably alone can provide which without it people struggle one obvious example being one that obsesses me is how do you how do you actually believe not just get told to follow through on or at least but how do you actually believe in the in the concept of the sanctity of human life I'm not trying to get on on to abortion or anything on this but how do you believe in the sanctity of human life as we live it in the absence of religion well we have a version of it in human rights which is a sort of a non-religious attempt to enshrine a religious idea but it's filled with trouble and there's I say there in that concept is a very very deep and important thing to hold on to God knows we need to hold on to it but you can see how even that slips slips that are that the margins it slips at the edges and and in the absence of that if we are as I think we obviously are meaning seeking beings whether or not there is meaning and I think the second bit of heart for the time being but if we are indeed meaning seeking beings then we will keep coming up with religions and I think that's what's happening at the moment broadly speaking in the cultures at the how our news is filled with religious urges and religious stories and am a newly emerging priesthood with a newly emerging set of Commandments and a newly emerging set of blasphemies and heresies and punishments and shaming Xand floggings all on social media some on social media and some in the real world I mean I'm always struck by the way in which by the number of people who say to me well things that you are able to say and think about and write about and so on if I said it in my job I'd probably lose it now and that's that's one of them and of course we can all name people who that has happened to it that's one of the things isn't it means that almost anything anything can be pushed it's an obvious perhaps too much of a cliche to say but it's in very short in a very short period of time it's become really quite hard to tell what's at are and what's real in our world they keep on getting clogged up or mixed up together you notice they seem to dance together and sometimes it's revealed that the satire is real and sometimes emerges of the real is satire and i think this leads to an enormous discombobulation and yes there is a very clear as I see it religious impulse throbbing through our society today creating a new religion by the way I just preferred the old ones and believe in them but I preferred the old ones or ill and all not least because I think you knew where you stood and we just no damn idea where you stand with this one I mean who knew that if you're a woman who said that you thought that being a woman involved having a vagina that you'd be some kind of absolutely despicable heretic in 2018 you knew that if you a woman on the labour left who campaigned for all-women shortlists which is not particularly south something I'm in favor of but who'd of who'd have predicted that if you're a woman in in favor of all-women shortlists and you'd be campaigning for ages for them that in 2018 if you said look like that that girl with a penis can't be on the old woman's shortlist you'd become some disgusting unmentionable bigger we wouldn't have seen that coming even two years ago probably and is that the main religion that you're that you're seeing it's wondering it's one of them but it could be absolute I mean I sort of point to X it could be anything I mean Saul Bellow has said in the early 80s you said that he said already that America was getting to the position that morality in America he said I think you can say this wider the morality now but he said morality in America had become a ghost town the problem with ghost towns is that almost anybody can come in and declare themselves sheriff who would you rely upon now to tell you something was true or not it's who would you nominate who if you nominated them would you feel you could get the agreement of everyone else in society to nominate it's pretty it's getting hard I think these lots of these points sort of the difficulty in making sense of the world who do you trust this whole idea of heresy links into the concept of the intellectual dark web in in some sense if there is something that links many of the figures together it's that they have been heretics to their own tribe you sort of take Sam Harris and the Ben Affleck or Brett Weinstein being kind of run out of evergreen what what do you make of the IDW I think it's it's a very smart concept to try to corral a very difficult group of very disparate people into one orbit I think Jordan P doesn't call it a herd of cats when I asked him about it yes that's that that's possible I think that there is some resistance to it within its own proclaimed membership relatively few people say I'm you know I'm I DW or something I mean I don't I don't specially think of myself in this regard because I suppose I never take you think of clubs of which I'm a member all parties or movements or anything like that so maybe I would maybe would be a movement for people who don't join movements I don't know club for people who don't like clubs I've I think so I think it's it's it's got all sorts of inbuilt awkwardness but I think it's also on Eric Weinstein when he came up with it I think it's definitely on to something it's something like I've tried to think about it and I think it's something like people who have trodden on one of the IEDs of our time and have survived now there's a very interesting question as to why some people set off one of the societal bombs waiting to catch people out and everything is over and done with and others seem to be able to it and survived but it's got something to do with being outside of the normal gate keeping organizations I think something like that but the real underlying thing is this I think which is that it is preposterous that almost everything that is true is so hard to say in public and so controversial the same public and so disputed and so so how old against I think everybody who's being described as a member that I had the IDW probably has among other things one thing in common which is they all they used to being held at for saying things that are self-evident how all that in public only to then discover that the public come up to them in private and say thank you so much for saying what we think and of course that's one of the beauties of it that's one of the beauties of technology at the moment is that the gatekeepers I'm having just said that all the problems of not being able to appoint gatekeepers anymore but that there's a whole set of things where the gatekeepers have sort of let everybody down I think and I suppose I'm not saying that I or anyone else can do it either individually or collectively but it seems to devolve onto individuals to say and think about things that are of wider relevance and all of the gatekeepers think our questions we should be engaging in I was very struck somebody came up to me after the event in London with Sam and Jordan and said they have they had a copy of that day's New York Times and I paid one two and three I think something to do with trans and this person said this his wife he Polly yeah that's it not yeah because of the New York time running so much about trans and we didn't address any anything to do with that tonight but I got what he meant it was like we're being given really weird quite fringe staff all the time as our diet and we're starting to rebel and in the the Sam Harris from Jordan Peterson debate would you say that you were I mean you've talked about your concerns of what happens if we lose religion or religious faith would you say you're closer to Jordan or to Sam on that point it sounds like you're closer to Jordan I'm slightly equi distant i am i don't have sam's belief I don't have any put another way I don't have Sam's faith in the idea that if we just brush away the remaining bracken from religion left by religion that we get to this reasonable rational world and I wish him obviously well not just as a friend but I wish him well and pursuing that idea and winning but there's an awful lot of historical examples of people trying something relatively similar and then discovering that they're right back at square one when Danton Rose Vieira standing outside not radar min Paris after Revolution and they work out they can make this a Cathedral of Reason you know I mean there's a lot of it there's a lot there's a lot about the pursuit of reason and rationalism that suggests that we're not great at it actually individually or collectively or to put it another way that we can keep on doing just terrible things and sometimes newly terrible things so that's an obvious prejudice as it were of my own and yet I think that what Jordan is saying or doing with religion which i think is extraordinary and admirable and tough for anything else right it's quite amazingly multi-disciplinary I mean that's one of the amazing things about what he's been able to do and what was a pleasure about listening to him I'm watching him in those debates he was one evening I think in Dublin he just tried to only approach things from using biology you know it's amazing an amazing sight and achievement but I I'm not sure where that's going I'm and I'm sympathetic with Sam when he tries to pin Jordan down and Jordan gets out of the pinning down I'm sympathetic to both of them in that my own my own position I'll I suppose is it I'm pretty willing to answer the questions that Sam would pose on I don't know Jordan for instance would find it doesn't want to won't well no let me be if you asked Jordan do you believe in the physical resurrection he would not say yes or no he would do a brilliant extrapolation of a lot of thoughts and maybe that is right maybe you shouldn't be able to just yes or no I think in my own case I can say I'm pretty confident it didn't happen but I'm confident to say that it didn't pretty much confidence it didn't happen and also say that doesn't mean that I'm going to follow sam harris into a world of pure reason and rationalism because i don't think it's much more achievable i think i've myself arrived at the position of believing you have to be careful on warring on things which have given you something of worth and I respect Jordans enormous ability and passion in trying to re-inject that particular part of worth back into the substructure of the society which i think is one of the things he's managing to do do you have any sense I mean you're sort of saying that we can't do without religion in some sense or we cut and we can't sort of reinvent our own values we've we've we've shown many times that we can't reinvent our own values do you have any sort of sense of how we kind of resolve that is it a new religion is a new kind of historically it's the invention of a new religion or war it's a pretty good time if you wanted to start a religion now would be a great time thought must have crossed your mind if you were to claim since no one's done it very plausibly for a while but if you were to claim that that you had yourself dipped the bucket right down into the well and brought up bucket full of the real thing you could do quite well these days I think it's one of the I sensed him the debates with Sam and Jordan I sensed that it was one of the things that was constantly hovering I don't know if you agree we're constantly hovering over the events Jordan in London gave a very moving and spellbinding description of a conversation sort of prophet nature of the two of them you mean yes specifically focusing on Jordan I think I think that Sam's followers and admirers I think on and expecting any kind of breakout beyond what he's said I don't I mean there's lots more for Sam to cover and talk about but I don't think there's anything they don't think they've I don't think I think there's anything that hasn't yet happened in a way and I thought that when Jordan started describing in London a conversation with a figure of what he saw as God the Father you could sense in the audience a feeling of is something going to happen now it was a spellbinding moment but there's something I it just goes back to the point I was trying to make was is that a plausible attempt to reassert a set of very basic truths and claims that religions have always made with very ripe firt at the moment and my own view is that were quite lucky that some total charlatan and shit hasn't come along with enormous power already to do that maybe it's less possible in the modern Information Age that would have been even in the time of the founder of Mormonism but let alone in what used to be called the age of the prophets but it's always there isn't it and and and if you have things like massive societal upheaval or war or catastrophic events we're all totally available it's terrifying returning to the IDW it's it's been framed as an alternative sense making network and in that sense that that's where you I hear that that's said in the accent to the Weinstein brothers yeah you're it's very a lot of the people within it Joe Rogan Dave Rubin have have created Sam Harris as well have created new media platforms distinct from the mainstream media as an alternative to the mainstream media you're grouped within this organization or this loose grouping but you're the associate editor of The Spectator magazine what's it say about the different media landscapes well I think a lot of us have a foot in on the foot out I mean I don't think any of us so is it were complete outsiders and I don't think anyone has ever pretended they were Jordan has spent his life with positions at the top universities in the world and Eric is a head of teal capital and I've not been exactly silenced during my career well it's not successfully and have a large number of publications and medium mediums o open to me and I'm very grateful lucky but so I think that it doesn't it's wrong to think of it as being an insider outsider thing or a or an establishment anti-establishment thing or something like that I'm not certain that there's a massive difference between America and Europe or American the UK in in terms of this I know that in in Europe and the UK the culture wars are fought slightly differently than they are in America because the the area of contestation is different and the width of the conversation is different and now after all there's a lot of stuff that we've sort of pretty much for good and for ill agreed upon in Europe that is not agreed upon in America so I'm not certain there is any kind of transatlantic divide what are you thinking of if what we're seeing in the u.s. at the moment is that the center cannot hold there is a kind of increasing polarization and a lack of agreement as to what even the facts consist of in some sense in the UK we have a bit we have the BBC we have some sense of a Civic space that is not completely polarized although isn't it the case everyone says so at the moment that the BBC is coming in for endless attack and there's actually feeling the attack and I think it probably is from the left and from the right at the moment possess that wouldn't get a bore on British politics the moment I mean the anti brexit people think the BBC's probe wrecks at the probe X that people think the BBC is anti bricks that the core bonuses think that the BBC is institutionally anti Corbin and conservatives seem to think that BBC is giving Corbin a great big leg over the wall of number 10 Downing Street so so it's uniting people well there's a fallacy there which which a lot of people at the BBC and others for for which is must be doing something right since I'm getting criticized from both sides and it's the fallacy often because you can be criticized by absolutely everyone that's because you're totally wrong there's a there's a weird by the way can I point this out there's a weird thing of what I think of as being equi distance isn't it's an ugly ism but where people think if they oppose something there they don't quite know how they hold the ground they feel they're in so what they do is they get something there to the other side and there they say well you see I'm standing between these two things I'm I'm very very worried about this tactic because I've seen it used among other things against many of my friends and against me for many years I remember more than a decade ago somebody writing from as it happens the Muslim Brotherhood in The Guardian claiming that ayaan Hirsi Ali Martin Amos and me were merely the flip side of the coin of Osama bin Laden and you'll notice what he did there and noticed that neither I nor Aiyar nor Martin have flown planes into buildings were told anyone else to do so mob in court anyway Lobby in court no you know it's it's so once you've seen it done to somebody or had it done to you that kind of other side of the coin ISM becomes a very cheap trick I pretty much resist it myself you see it everywhere okay we've found somebody who we can accuse of that from the left let's find somebody from the right we can accuse it also says it's a sort of but it's it's the sort of game that people start to play when they feel there's nowhere else to hold on to on the waterslide you know let me get something for both sides to hold myself something like steady so I'm not entirely persuaded that the media landscape is that defined it or the distinct difference but it it probably is the case in Britain there's a there's there's less of the complete talking past each other than has emerged now in the u.s. it's possible there is some agreement still about reality in the UK do you have any sense are you very pessimistic about this kind of increasing polarization or do you have any sense of how we pull out of this spiral I'm um well I'm in this cause for optimism and pessimism isn't there as a restraint in everything um I'm pessimistic in the fact that I think that people are becoming so incredibly embedded and irrational in their embeddedness and I mean I just able to say it seems to me absolutely thing now I'm very I'm very pessimistic about that I think I'm pessimistic about what I describe as a tendency to talk about each other and not to each other I spent part of my summer touring Australia and New Zealand with dr. Cornel West the point of the engagements for me at any rate being that and I think for Cornell as well being to demonstrate that people from totally different political traditions could sit on stage for hours at a time night after night talking about important things not not dodging things not ducking but being able to have a rich and meaningful dialogue and sorting some things out you know which I think we did actually between ourselves if not for anyone else and I'm very struck by how few people do that and as obvious there's lots of reasons for why that's happened we all know and I'm afraid that the mainstream media has been a massive component of that strange degrading tendency but the thing that you can be optimistic about in it is that it's obvious that new things are coming through I mean and this is this is always the way isn't it I mean you can you can berate and be well as I do the YouTube ization of discussion that means that the BBC or ITV or let alone some of the American networks will get on one absolutely shouty crazy nutter from one direction then one apps he shouted crazy nutter from another and call that a discussion and that I believe embeds itself with a new generation of people who think that is discussion you can be wailing boom own that but look what we're doing now is the demonstration of the opposite which as it turns out yes that can happen and it also turns out that there's a reaction to that which means that there's an audience for long form often multi-hour discussions I mean this so there's always there's always both reason for optimism and pessimism in this I the thing I'm most nervous about is is that we need we do need to find some way to agree on certain tent pegs certain lines it's it's just it's just very difficult as you're going through it vocals Murray thank you very much [Music] you
