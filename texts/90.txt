[Music] so welcome to the fourth ruble wisdom podcast this is going to be about the intellectual dark web I'm kind of assuming most of the people watching this most of our audience will know what the intellectual dialog is but I think it's worth doing in a short introduction it's sort of emerged from the sort of network of thinkers you've got unofficially in it you've got Eric Weinstein Brett Weinstein Joe Rogan and Dave Rubin Jordan Peterson sam Harris Douglas Murray Majid Nawaz and a few more names I mean there was there was a few that were in the New York Times article that kind of officially I guess inaugurated as a concept I think we have a slightly different take on what it is and where it's going I think a lot of people are looking at at the moment through a sort of political lens and it's a good first step because I think what it does is these are all people who've got a real kind of attachment to free speech an attachment to having difficult conversations about topics that are increasingly difficult to have in the mainstream media and what I think it's done initially like the whole phenomena of the intellectual Dartmouth has showed up showing up how ideological the media has become like some things you can say some things you can't say but I think there's a kind of mistake to see it just through this political lens which is I what I think a lot of the people and descriptions of it have been so far yeah and it's ironic in a way because a big one of the tenants of it is to move beyond ideology and to be able to have these discussions which are you know free from that for me the really interesting thing is what happens or what's the direction we start moving in when we begin to have these conversations beyond ideology this is where I think I and we have a different understanding about it because I see it potentially moving towards a synthesis moving towards a an intellectual synthesis and someone like Jordan Peterson is a really good starting point for this because he already synthesizes so many different ways of looking at the world he integrates evolutionary biology integrates psychology he integrates mythology and religion and ends up in a very similar place with all of them he then kind of also brings in neuroscience and says yeah well chaos and order even the brain is divided between chaos and order look at Ian McGilchrist it's work the master in the emissary the left brain the right brain there's there's a there's a real integration happening already with someone like Jordan Pederson there was a really amazing podcast with the day on the day Rubin show with Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson and then I've seen another couple where Jordan Peterson was on Ben Shapiro's podcast and what you see is it's almost like Jordan Peterson kind of absorbed than Shapiro in a way because venture Piero's argument is sort of from from revelation it's like okay we have these moral truths that are kind of given to us and Peterson was saying well these moral truths also evolved but you can look at kind of how morality evolves but there is in some sense like a revelation from above and a morality that evolves and the two come together and that there's some sort of sense of like Peterson's conception of religion and evolution and morality kind of encompass been Shapiro's perspective and he's able to say well yeah I'm not saying you're wrong Ben but I also think you can get there from many different methods and that's all it was a really like amazing thing to see like you could just see the synthesis in action I mean it's it's slightly kind of maybe unfair to ben shapiro to say that Jordan Peters absorbed it but Jordan Peterson had the biggest frame and Ben Shapiro had a very deep frame he's a very deep thinker but his frame was then encompassed within Jordan Peterson's and you could see the the intellectual excitement of both of them to have that conversation at then Shapiro in particular the respect that he had for Jordan Pederson and where he was coming from like really reframed and rather than another level of depth potentially to what what Ben Shapiro was already saying and you do see a lot of the guys in the intellectual dark web they have these conversations and then when you watch them on another podcast they're saying something that sounds an awful lot like someone they've heard before like so people are sounding a lot more like Jordan previous after we expect a lot of time with it so there this is what I feel the synthesis is is about but again it can only happen if people are prepared to to allow what is untrue to burn off to do what Peterson says again it's like are you willing to allow what is false to burn off and to go through the process of yeah of growth which is always painful and I think there is a shared understanding between all of the or between lots of the members of the intellectual dark web that there is something called reality that we can perceive that is independent of us as perceivers which is you know that's that for me has a lot of the energy and excitement of it is moving away from that postmodern mulch of radical radical relativity and that is a key thing if you want to burn away the Deadwood because you have to that I mean inherent in that is the idea that there is there is something core beneath it and then there is something that is true so again it you know it is a reclaiming of truth as well but I think a lot of them really share otherwise why talk to get somewhere you have to get towards something that is independent of all of us as perceivers and for me that's where a lot of the power of it comes from and what's fascinating is that you just get a sense the people involved in this conversation recognize something is happening it's almost like a conversation it's becoming self-aware it's aware of itself and it's very excited by Dave Reubens the classic example is kind of like something's going on the Internet's full of foresters together and I don't believe in kind of synchronicity but something's happening and and I I think it's kind of a Great Awakening you could you could and I wonder whether you could almost return it it's a great intellectual awakening partly generated again it's partly created by the internet ISM where we now have the possibilities have three our conversations we now have the possibility to kind of follow the rabbit hole as far down as it goes we have the capability to now find it find ideas outside the acceptable kind of surface level mainstream of the mainstream media and then go down these rabbit holes and potentially be changed as a consequence yeah I feel that energy with it when I watch it and just you know engage with it there is that sense of that kind of electric sense of something happening for me it's about the beginnings of something happening it is something happening but it's the beginnings of something bigger and I think that's where the excitement comes from like if you look at a lot of the key players they have had - they're talking about their ideas in a very different way but they've all had to embody their ideas to some degree like Brett Weinstein had to do something and stand up you know call it Jordan Peterson of course actually do a lot of things and it was under a lot of pressure I think that's a really interesting thing about it is that these are people whose philosophy had to be embodied in some way and I think that's the direction we're moving in that's a really good idea that's a really smart way of looking at it because yeah it's like these people have had to live out their philosophies and Bret and Eric Weinstein talked about it on the day Reuben podcast which is an amazing podcast watch it you haven't seen already the what you've had is almost this selection process for people who are thinking outside the box because if you if you insist that everyone uses a certain set of pronouns I like the Jordan Peter certainly you insist that all white professors don't come into a college on a certain day as they did with Brett Weinstein what you'd find is the people who are prepared to say no are prepared to stand out against the herd they are exactly the kind of people who you need who are almost certain to have created something extraordinary in their work because they're they're thinking differently and also I think you also sort of touch on the idea that this is the start of a conversation that there is a deeper synthesis that potentially there they're moving towards so there's there's many levels to this conversation and the intellectual dart lab is sort of the it's almost like a holding concept for the ongoing conversation and it is a conversation you've got throughout this this summer and this year and ongoing you've got a lot of these guys in conversation with each other in very public venues and effectively what what we're seeing is kind of intellectual content becoming like this happened a comedy in the 90 suddenly comedy came the small clubs and was now kind of selling out the o2 arena and Wembley and all this sort of stuff and this is now happening with intellectual content which has to be a good thing but also so there's there's the sense of okay this conversation is happening but if this conversation is not an open inquiry then it's gonna fail I think and this is up to everyone in the intellectual dark web to make sure that this is the case it's like so that what is the meta conversation how do you have a meta conversation that's genuinely generative that's genuinely kind of potentially finding a resolution and you have to be the people involved like it takes a huge amount of intellectual courage for someone like sam harris to say you know maybe I was a bit I was wrong about this atheist thing he's made an entire career and wrote several books about this so I think at some point he's at least gonna have to refrain kind of what he means and accept that some kind of metaphorical truth is also valuable as well as scientific truth so this sense of like open inquiry is is really important it's like am i open to new information or do I just keep trying to kind of filter everything into what I already think well you're not really an intellectual unless you're willing to release your previously held notions when new information comes to light that's what if that's what it really should be I think and just just on the on the rock stadium kind of feel of it you know I was just thinking you know I think it's interesting to look at the energy that drives that many people to want to go instead of seeing a concert see an intellectual talk and what strikes me about the whole thing and about what they're doing on one level is it's an inquiry into reality because increasingly in a kind of post truth world we don't have a sense of what reality is you know practically politically metaphysically and I think there's a deep hunger for that and that's again why that inquiry has to remain open because reality is bigger than the person perceiving it contrary to the postmodern world view which would say no it's it's all these perceptions as the conversations continue I hope that what we will start to see is a real is a growing synthesis between these different perspectives and the intellectual dark web and these are really deep perspective this is why it's another mistake to look at it through the political lens is that these these guys go right to the bedrock my Petersen goes right to the bedrock Brett Weinstein goes right to the bedrock in terms of evolutionary biology Eric Weinstein is a superstar mathematician who I think probably has a very different take on it because he's seeing sort of he's seeing almost like the source code and I think that's probably why he originated that the whole concept of the intellectual dart web because he's seeing quite a long way down the track but there's a few things that then are holding up that synthesis for example of jordan peterson and sam harris there's a huge that that's a really interesting conversation cuz cuz if if they're both willing to do the work and to give up like sam harris in a very difficult position because i think ultimately he is going to have to concede that there are mythological truths in religion as brett Weinstein says they are mythologically true or what'd he say they're metaphorically true but literary literally false sam house had been very resistant to that perspective but i I think going as this conversation continues he's gonna find it increasingly difficult to defend that position so just a reverse back a bit to what you're saying a second ago for me one of the really interesting questions is is it a synthesis like it is I think a synthesis but also the way paradigm shifts the way you know kuhn pointed out paradigm shifts happen or when the existing paradigm there's so much that doesn't fit into it that the pressure builds and eventually new one forms so I'm just wondering where the you know you just talked about Peterson and Harris in a sense some worldview has to give in in some way you know the materialist paradigm potentially has to give to something beyond that something that integrates that but moves beyond it and recognizes for example religion and the transcendent so for me I think that's where it could go is that the synthesis also leads to something shifting fundamentally in the way we communicate and the way we you know an ideas revolution as they talked about you know for me that requires some synthesis first but then some kind of radical reevaluation as well how do we how the hell do we find a way through that chaos and how do we see reality more clearly and I think that is an overwhelming urge for millions of people right now how do we see reality more clearly and yeah to your point it has to be done in a flexible open way because reality is constantly shifting and I think Peterson in particular understands that but he talks about the humility of understanding that you don't know enough by definition that in a way God is fear of God he talked about the interview divided with him like what's what's the real key to to true knowledge and I suggested that kind of intellectual courage was a big part of that and kind of embodied knowledge as a big part of that and he said that fear of God was the beginning of wisdom and what he meant by that was you always have to remember as if your life depends on it because it does that you don't know enough and so there's it requires that kind of level of humility so to summarize we think that the intellectual dark lever is a kind of placeholder for an ongoing conversation that hopefully will approach some kind of synthesis like intellectual synthesis able to jump between evolutionary biology and psychology and all these different things but ultimately saying well we're looking at the same thing this is how the world is but we can look at these different ways mathematics and they're ironing out at the moment hopefully that ironing out all of this sort of disagreements between them Sam Harris you and Peterson all that sort of stuff with the hope that they can reach this kind of synthesis where does it go if that's true what is what what comes next I think ultimately the intellectual synthesis is only one part and what needs to happen is kind of there's an embodied synthesis that needs to come come in as well and there's a there's a danger of it just becoming an intellectual thing whereas actually we know things are that core like we don't know things from here we know things in our gut we know things in our emotions and there's an embodied there's an embodied nature to true knowing so I'm looking at people like who are now not considered it part of the intellectual diet web but I think a holding really key parts of the puzzle Richard Tarn as I mentioned before I think kind of named it all really really clearly back in the seventies I think know a bit later if he was actually not in the 90s you've got people like Stan Grof who've been working with psychedelic therapy and transformational work since the since the 50s Jamie will who we interviewed and we're about to bring out another interview with soon he he's a he works with flow states and he works with transformational states that I think is is is where we have to go there are things we cannot understand with just our minds and coming into the body and also living and you know acting out and putting these things into our lives which you know Peterson talks about a lot that is really for me the next stage and philosophy used to be like that before before Plato in particular where it became about kind of a discussion of ideas and they kind of let's let's have a dialectic and let's you know discuss these ideas which is important but it's not enough it's not enough they have to be lived as something else happens when you do that something very different happens and it changes how we are in the world and it also frees us from ideology and in a very new way because ideology is a thing of of the ego in the mind so if you stay up there you can't undo ideology with the mind really it comes from a much deeper level and that's why it's exciting to explore all these different thinkers who are really at the cutting edge of those practices and the cutting edge of the science behind it as well and also why we are increasingly doing workshops yeah rebel wisdom has always had the intellectual content and the film's but also the work shops and we're expanding that we've got some amazing facilitators coming in Louise Mazzanti from the glitch in the matrix film and we've done a couple of interesting interviews with her might be solder raffia Turia we've got some amazing people who have kind of going to come and lead stuff for us so that's really really exciting so we're introducing a new section or stealing it from Sam Harris he calls it housekeeping which is kind of like logistics and kind of what's coming up and all the rest of it and what's coming up is the first rebel wisdom road trip in America we're flying out to LA on Sunday the first and we're out there for about two weeks so if you're watching this new you're out there la San Fran Bay Area or you can suggest people that we should be interviewing there we've already got some amazing people lined up we're going to see Jordan green haul a cure of the Dom Richard Thomas Warren Farrell so we've got a really amazing list of interview interviewees already if you can think of anyone that we should be talking to then give us a shout or if you are a rebel wisdom devotee let us know we'll also have some merch with us that we might be giving out t-shirts to people so so yeah get in touch if you're in the Bay Area or in on the west coast you
