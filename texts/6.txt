[Music] so it feels really interesting to be here because we've featured on our channel quite a lot the intellectual dark web and it feels like this is one of the places that gave birth to the intellectual dark web as a as a thing what do you make of the intellectual dark web as it was and where do you think it is now sort of maybe a year after its first emerged yeah well I guess if there's a physical center of the intellectual dark web it's right here I mean it's in my garage because I think this is where not where the ideas all started but at least where most of the connections between the people started and you know people ask me my role in this whole thing and whether it is a thing at all you know whether it is some sort of card-carrying organization or it's this loose affiliation or whatever it is I think my role in it is I've been a little bit of the connective tissue between the people because I'm not a biologist like Brett Weinstein or Heather Heying I'm not an economist like his brother Eric Weinstein I'm not a psychologist like Jordan and you know the list goes on and on but I'm an interviewer or at least I've become an interviewer and for whatever reason over the course of the couple years that I've been doing this as someone that came from the left I started seeing all of these issues related to free speech and open inquiry and the constant labeling of everyone else as a bigot and a homophobe and a racist than the rest of it I started talking about that from a leftie perspective and and you know it's interesting because a lot of the IDW we get labeled like we're somehow all right wing or were conservatives or something like that most of these people at least were lefties and I think most of them actually still consider themselves lefties to some extent so I started talking about these issues and you know I've been in a couple studio since we started this show so I originally started the show at aura TV which is Larry King's digital network then we we left there for a little bit and we did the show at I can say this now I didn't say it for a long time I was actually renting Roseanne Barr studio in LA before the whole the Twitter fiasco and all that and then eventually we started doing it here in my home about two and a half years ago now and I think because I came from the left I was uniquely positioned to talk about these issues with the right people in a way that would get lefties who were going wait what has happened to liberalism what has happened to free expression I was uniquely positioned to get people to talk about it in an open way so if there is a center I suppose it's here the center is not too far also of course from Joe Rogan's studio and just any of these people that are that are openly and honestly willing to engage in ideas to sit across from somebody and look them in the eye and figure out what do they think how does that match up against what you think what don't you know what does someone know that you don't know sometimes I sit across from somebody who it's very obvious to me they're not really a master of their thoughts and I learned something because of that so so whatever the IDW is and whatever it may become I'm very proud I think if I do nothing else you know in the rest of my career or a professional life like we created something partly in this room that has woke people up around the globe I mean I just did you know basically a year on the road with Jordan Peters and a hundred twenty plus stops all over the world you know from Sweden and Denmark to you know to right here in California to Canada to wherever and it's like wow people real people not just Twitter trolls and Russian BOTS are waking up to some of these ideas and that's incredibly cool and I guess why I really identified with with this as well is that I sort of also have also done identified myself as a leftist and feeling sort of more and more politically homeless as time has gone on and kind of feeling that the the left is kind of going off in a direction that I'm not comfortable with and but the intellectual dart web has always been like some of the most exciting conversations were for example Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson talking about religious truth and just having the sort of sense of an evolving conversation going somewhere into an area that's way beyond politics do you see it as primarily a political thing or do you think that it's it's a much bigger conversation oh I think it's a much bigger conversation I think it's cultural first and you know sort of the meme out there right now is that politics is downstream from culture that's what everyone's sort of saying I think Andrew Breitbart originally said that but it really is true so for example the the one that you're referencing when I had Shapiro in here with Peterson we didn't really plan anything I said I said Ben I got Jordan in studio Ben's not too far from here I said if you got an hour why don't you swing by and let's just see what happens now I knew there's an interesting discussion to be had there here you have Jordan Peterson who I think is the leading intellectual of our time and after being on tour with the guy I mean to say I'm in awe of him is actually not doing it justice I mean the guy is truly the real deal but here's someone who talks you know does these biblical lectures really has has awoken a let's say a religious spirit not necessarily for people to become religious per se but he has woken up something related to belief in a lot of young people and a lot of end people all ages and here's Ben Shapiro who comes from a traditional Orthodox Jewish background I thought there's a great discussion to be had here and what I think I can do in those conversations is I can kind of throw the softball up let them start playing and then there are moments and I think there was a particular moment in that sit-down where they're going you know and Ben's talking really fast and Jordans doing everything with his hands and there's there's so many big ideas happening and they're talking about all sorts of things and there's a moment where I say guys guys we got to get this to a place where the average person can have a little more understanding because that's what I consider myself like I have a good handle on these ideas obviously and I I lived this and I breathe it and but when I'm watching these things happen I'm also watching a little bit as a viewer myself and there was a moment where it was getting so high wire I was like okay we what we're doing right now is we're taking some really eternal messages about belief and truth and all of these things that a lot of people can understand but now we're taken to a place where if we keep going it's less people are gonna send less people are saying and then there's only to be one guy I understand and you know I don't know who that's gonna be at is that is one criticism is that you're not an intellectual well I don't know that it's for me to say whether I'm an intellectual or not I mean and I understand these ideas I love learning I mean I more than anything else if I've done anything right in my life it's that every week I get to sit down across from somebody who's got something interesting to say some people are far more interesting than others I don't think that makes me an intellectual per se I mean you know I come from a stand-up comedy background I like interviewing people I like public speaking or all of those things I don't think it really matters I think there's a there's a certain elite or like I'll see this where people say oh well you've got the psychologist and the harvard-trained lawyer and or whatever and it's like and then there's Ruben and it's like all right I am a piece of this you know you mean like I would say a good basketball team you can't have five Michael Jordan's on the team you need a guy that can set picks and you need a guy that can pass and a guy that can score and do all of those things and you need a guy that comes off the bench and I do think just it's just my nature I am a bit of a team player generally speaking so whether I mean whether I'm an intellectual per se or someone that has a I would say if anything I mean it's sort of uncomfortable to do so but I would say if anything I think I'm a communicator of ideas so not all of these ideas have all just magically appear I chose well probably yeah well I would say I would say communicator and and for the purposes of the show itself the curator is the right way to describe it because all I did when this show started was I started talking about what I was thinking there's something wrong with the left it's loosely related to free speech are there other ways that good decent liberals can get their goals accomplished of say equality gay marriage things like that that don't have to do with government intervention and that's what that opened me a little bit more to some libertarian views and that really was how I was able to truly understand what classical liberalism is and the fact that I you know even the phrase classical liberalism that that's even spoke of now it is a little something to do with something that we did right here in this room so I'm very proud of that and whether whether I'm an intellectual or a guy that's sitting across from these people in curating some of these ideas or communicating some of these ideas or whatever that is I don't even think that really matters and it almost is not it's just not for me to say I'm just I'm really just doing what I think is right and I'm thrilled to be part of whatever this is really and obviously this is happening in an American context where we're based in the UK so and I think probably about 50% of our audiences is us but it's really fascinating to see so we're kind of exposed to the American conversation but it feels like it's happening at so much of a fever pitch compared to how it is in the in the UK even where it's still like we've brexit especially it's still quite a kind of intense conversation but there is something about the American polarization that just seems to be ramping up and up and at the same time there the IDW originally was designed to be a sort of space beyond that polarization but it feels that that's a very difficult space to hold do you think it's even possible to hold that space in the US so I think that's basically the key question almost for every Western democracy right now is whether the center or some version of a tolerant middle that can agree to disagree can that hold you know it's interesting because after being on the road and visiting all these countries in the last year you know I was in Ireland when the Brett Kavanaugh thing was happening and the fact that so many people in Ireland after a show and I did my meet and greet we're asking me what I thought about Brett Cavanaugh the Supreme Court justice in the United States I thought something feels off to me here why would the average person in Ireland not only care about this why would they even know about this so in a weird way I suppose the United States has almost exported a little bit of our craziness but that's just a nature of the way time and information operate now I mean we're all walking around with devices that connect us to the world and right the second you know I mean I could send out a tweak right now that would ruin my career you know cause all sorts of repercussions and you guys the whole thing I mean there's a lot of power in that and also I don't know that we've quite figured out how to grapple with that power so when when the IDW started to come together before the intellectual dark web phrase had even been uttered by Eric I think we really were just trying I think unknowingly perhaps we were trying to protect the middle I think that's what it was and if you look at of the original crew of this thing so if you were to take Eric and Brad who I already mentioned if you took Sam well right there you have three lefties these are these are guys who have been on the left their whole life now you could take a guy like Ben who obviously is a conservative and you could take Jordan who say more conservative or more traditional some level but we really did have people did and do have people all over the map and that's what you should want in a free Western society what you want is a lefty like Sam Harris to do be to be able to debate the nature of truth with a conservative like Jordan Peterson and at the end they don't it's not about somebody winning although in the day of internet everyone wants somebody to win or be destroyed or something like that but it's not somebody has to win it's that they to true intellectual powerhouses got to debate not only if they done it on podcast but they've done it in front of live audiences and they've done it in the UK in front of thousands and thousands of people and they did it several times and in a Western society it's like everyone hears the debate you then make your choices oh you know Sam did make a good point about this but I agree maybe with Jordans macro view of the world or you know I'm eight maybe I'm an atheist personally but I see a value of a society being based around judeo-christian values or something like that it's like that's what you want in the West that's what you want in a free society so I think that's really what we've tried to do there has been no topic that I know of that we haven't been able to cover and agree to disagree or at least shelve the portion that we that really upsets us to each other so for example in this very studio in that chair ben shapiro sat in that chair which is in my home where he knows i am married to my husband and he has expressed you know that he personally through his religious understanding of the world he's not thrilled with gay marriage that's a light way of putting it but now he takes a more libertarian approach i can live with that i don't need to somehow impose my view of the world on ben shapiro and on his religious beliefs what i need is for him not to impose those beliefs on the way i can live and we've gotten there we've there I'm married and he's not trying to impose anything on me and and that's good so that's like the type of and guess what we're doing that in my home and this is the same guy who will say he won't come to a an anniversary party at my home because he doesn't in his strict religious sense of the world doesn't approve of my marriage it's not that I love that I don't love that you know people I see lefties will attack me on Twitter I see you're sitting there with this homophobic bigot and bah-bah-bah I'm like you know what then and I have much more respect for each other then you guys seem to have for either one of us and you're telling us were the intolerant ones meanwhile we're trying we're really trying to work through something and I would say more than anything else when it comes to that example where this is a true I mean this is a fundamental like how you live your life difference that we have my belief is that over time if Ben and I or anyone that I was having this conversation I think we can keep having that conversation and now I'm a couple years older than Ben so now I'm 80 let's say and he's 74 or whatever it is I suspect that he will have come more along my line of thinking in this case than I will have come to his but there's only one way to find out and that's by not killing each other and not be platforming each other in the rest of it so we have to keep doing this and and to the real point of your question can a center hold I don't know but perhaps that's the most relevant reason why we need to keep trying we are living in a time when the sides are fraying there's there's no doubt about it at the same time what I would say is that perhaps the center the sane center I would say maybe that has shifted a little bit center-right right now because I see something very rich happening on what I would call is the center right so sort of conservatives with a more libertarian bent which I'm definitely seeing from young people then you've got classical liberals you've got sort of the X lefties who are looking for refuge and there's something really interesting happening on the center right and I see none of that on the left or there is no center left really anymore there's a couple stragglers but that's about it so we have to keep fighting for that ability to do agree to disagree that that's all you have in a free society and Aki Aki built it but your point about whether the center can hold I think that's the the most key question so on rebel wisdom we don't really we don't really go down at the political level that often we're much more interested in what are the what's the meta conversation and the meta conversation for for me if you wanted us or take it up to a slightly higher level which is why I think Jordan Peterson is so interesting because I think he is coming from this very psychological metaphysical level but then that has ramifications further down in culture and politics but effectively it's something like the the shifts that we saw in the 60s went too far one way and there was a lot of traditional stuff that was basically thrown out the baby was thrown out with the bathwater and the kind of synthesis we're looking for is kind of some of the freedoms that we've seen through the 60s but with some of the traditional wisdom that actually has a huge evolutionary history and political history and so that's kind of that's kind of for me the point on the other side of these culture wars in some sense what do you think the center looks like from that kind of meta perspective well it's interesting because no matter how frustrated I am with the left now I don't argue that somehow the left has never been good or that some of the ideas that have come out of the left have not been good so you know equality for women voting rights for women good the Civil Rights Act good gay marriage these are things that came out of progressive ideas now all of those things what did all of those things have in common they all helped make people equal equal in that they had equal opportunity and they were equal under the law that's all the Western society can guarantee you I would say that's all any functioning free society can offer you is absolute equal playing field it doesn't mean you're born into the exact same circumstance so some of us are born into a rich family some of us are born poor some of us are born handicapped some of us are born with great athletic skill I mean all of those things are not privileges per se those are just the nature's of reality so I acknowledge that there there was a decent left and it's too long ago that that left existed now what I would say on the right is right now as I just said because there is this interesting you know you've got Trump people and neo cons and never Trump errs and libertarians and classical you have this really wide group of people who are all sort of agreeing to disagree right now and I go to colleges and I get up and I let me get invited by conservatives and libertarians I never get invited by Democrats or lefties or liberals or anything like that and I give a different speech every time but I would gladly go and talk to those people I just don't get invited to them now you'd think well how does that make sense you're gay married you're pro pot you're pro-choice you're against the death penalty I'm for reforming the prison system I believe in strong public education I mean these are all left you know thought of as lefty ideas but because I talk about identity politics I focus on free speech I'm frustrated with the core of what leftism has become um I'm an apostate to those guys so I would say the center the center now has shifted a little bit right and if you if you have a basic understanding that what you're guaranteed let's say in the United States is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness then you're gonna have to live in a society with people that you disagree with I have no idea what my neighbor thinks politically I I just don't know on either side of my house I don't see these people that often they seem like decent people but I suspect we disagree on a whole slew of things well they're welcome to do that they can't do it on my property but beyond that they can do that and I would much rather live in that society than a society that's forcing us all to think all the same things so yes we need you know Jordan talks about sort of a healthy tension between the right and the left we do need some of that but I would say right now because what is happening on the left has become so toxic that freethought is really being crushed and destroyed and if you dare go against any of those things look I just gave you my lefty cred wood is there anyone on the left that will tolerate me no I mean it just isn't now there may be an individual person Brett Weinstein still thinks of himself on the left he's nice to me but I mean in terms of the institutional version of the left there there is nobody so I'm very happy to keep talking to these conservatives that maybe five years ago I thought were the bad guys or these people on the right because they seem very open and let's keep let's keep enriching that and see what happens and if the center and sup becoming a little more right then maybe I wanted ten years ago all right you know you don't get everything exactly as you wanted but I think that would be the the space for the most freedom to be able to flourish and the the intellectual darkweb as first conceived was a sort of alternative sense making framework it's kind of the naming of a lot of alternative media and it feels especially with maybe the Covington thing this this year that the the mainstream and probably the Muller report as well the mainstream media is kind of hemorrhaging credibility at a faster and faster rate and in a way the naming of the IDW was kind of the coming to fruition of a of a new alternative media and what it feels to me that's happened since I'm thinking specifically of for example Joe Rogan's into Jack Dorsey he got more pushback than I've seen him ever get from his audience for not holding Jack to account and this is really interesting it feels like over the last year some of the expectations of the mainstream media and now being applied to the alternative media like that that now but it's kind of flipped in a way but with that flipping comes some kind of new responsibility absolutely so that makes sense it not only does that make sense I mean I think that actually is the reality of what's going on here look first off when we talk about the mainstream media we all use phrases - that are sort of blanket phrases to talk about small things so I don't say everyone in the mainstream media is horrible but by and large most of what the mainstream media offers us is some version of propaganda and we see this over and over again and we're now you know between the Covington's story between the Jesse smollett story between the Miller report between all of these things you start realizing why are things always framed through this sort of leftist social justice prism or that you know anyone that's conservative is default the bad guy or that Trump have been a Russian operative I mean the Trump Russia thing is one of the most interesting ones because I've had plenty of people on this show that were that have been vehemently against Trump from the beginning say say Sam Harris who's been one of his biggest critics I've had people who have you know they like some of the things he says and then criticize him on others say ben shapiro and i've had people who were supporters of his like scott adams and that's why i wasn't that surprised when the election happened because i had been listening to people from all over the place i had mike cern Abidjan and i got a ton of crap for it but i thought where is a trump supporter that maybe can explain a little bit of the gestalt of what's going on here and Serna vich was a published author and this was before he became sort of no no he's quite a household name but an Internet household name let's say and I thought let me let me talk to somebody who kind of gets it so when the election day rolled around and I was on Joe Rogan I think that I was either on the day before the election or maybe the day of the election I kept saying I it's very possible Trump could win because I had been hearing those conversations but if you had only been listening to mainstream media you wouldn't have gotten any of that so I would say look I'm not happy that we're watching mainstream media fail if mainstream media would just be I tweet this all the time if mainstream media would just be a little bit better then there would be less need for all of what we're doing if they would be willing to have some honest conversations if they would be willing to talk about policy without labeling half the country deplorable or racist and what about the extra responsibility that places on to the alternative well so then what that does is well okay so now so we have mainstream media kind of crumbling and then suddenly there were these voices on YouTube mostly on YouTube but now through podcasts who started having real conversations so for example the first version of the Rubin report where we did a where did a straight-up interview it's only about three and a half years ago now it was September of 2015 and I had Sam Harris on and we were there to clean up some of the mess around all of the things people had been saying about him and it all started with that Ben Affleck gross and racist line and we finished the show and I we sat there for about an hour and a half I thought wow we just did something important it felt important and real and honest and relevant to me where I never saw any of that anymore you could even look look at CNN you know when they got rid of Larry King I really think you know Larry's now a friend and a mentor in the fact that he thinks I'm even remotely decent at this is incredible but I don't think it's a coincidence that when CNN got rid of Larry King whose show by the way was either number one or number two show on the network but they wanted to go younger I don't think it's a coincidence that CNN started to crumble because whatever you thought of Larry and I I loved him and loved him now he was having real conversations now you maybe didn't like the way he interviewed or this or that but he was he was basically a trusted decent human being who was having real conversations and once he disappeared they replaced him with Piers Morgan then that failed then the last little bits of remnants of trust in cable news basically just eroded and then that that spread then into into Network News and then I think it spread into the the BuzzFeed HuffPo Vox monster whatever you want to call that so yes there is an odd amount of pressure on us now which which is weird because I'm not a journalist I'm again I'm an interviewer I do the best I can I don't lie to my audience I will flub things now and again I try to correct myself when we do but I don't know exactly what standards we should be held to so Joe in the case that you're talking about when he had Jack on originally I think he did look he must have acknowledged at some level that he didn't get it all right because he saw the push back and then he had Tim Poole on to sort of act as the interlock er between them and I think that was the right move but should Joe be held to the standards of if he was on CNN and doing that show I don't know exactly but he is by his audience I mean that's the key right so if you're held by your audience so that's good if you're how about your audience as opposed to the mob I guess that's the distinction that we have to make that there's a never moving amorphous mob coming for everybody all the time the second you say something that doesn't sound right to them or if they can selectively edit something you say to make it sound like something you didn't say or anything else then the mob will come for you being held to account by your audience is good so if I brought someone in here and really dropped the ball relative to some some question that I should have got to or some follow-up I should have had sometimes people will tweet at me or Willie million so you know I wish you would have asked this person out of it and I'll go alright you know like I'm learning on the job too and I hope to keep getting better at all that so I like being held to a high standard I don't know that we can be held because we're not a unified front I mean Joe and I happen to both do things on YouTube and we're podcasters and we're interviewers and we both happened to do stand-up but we're not we don't work together you know so there isn't sort of a layer of a network effect that would keep us in line with each other but what I can say is generally speaking the the crew that we're talking about here these people have very high standards they have high integrity we don't impugn motives we don't attack people we try to talk about ideas more than people and hopefully if we're held to some higher standards even if it's not quite fair hopefully we can live up to them so do you think that your job might be changing as the as the the culture changes well it's changing in that all of our profiles are higher now you know like I don't think anything I'm doing per se you know I'm working on my book I'm doing the interviews I do public speaking all of these things those things are consistent I mean hopefully I get more of those gigs and you know the audience continues to grow in all of those things but I guess by the nature of things growing and more people caring about the ideas of the intellectual dark web and if not if the IDW has done anything I would say we created a space where people could just think a little bit and you know most people you're watching these videos on your phone so it's a salt it's a solitary experience where you're listening you know in your earbuds or whatever and you don't know if well if you're at the gym and you're listening to me talk to Peterson it's like is anyone else at this gym listening to Peterson does anyone else know about any of this stuff and that's what's so cool about going to the live events because then you look around the room and you go whoa there's thousands of people here and they come from every walk of life and what do they want to do they want to have honest conversation they don't want to rip apart all the goodness that the West has offered us they want to agree to disagree and and they they look diverse actually even though that's not the diversity that matters and that's that's incredibly cool so we have to keep we have to keep opening that space that which I think you're referring to is the middle it's that space to be a thinking human being that we have to keep defending no matter how hard it gets and actually the harder it gets to do that the more important it is so I suppose our work is cut out for us because I guess my my concern or my question is whether the the intellectual dark web because it's it's often characterized as being merely reactionary that it's that it's it's and in some sense it is because it is reacting against the the way that some conversations have been shut down so there is a reactionary element to it in terms of we need to carve out a space for genuine dialogue I guess my concern looking from the outside is whether it's genuine and pushing forward to a new synthesis or potential synthesis or it's just stuck in because you'll always have an audience for saying the left is going out of control yeah but it is it pushing forward to a new synthesis is that something you're interested in doing yeah well I don't always want to be reacting as a human being I don't want that and I don't want my conversations in here to be oh what happened this week let's react to it I don't think that's how you can actually forge a better freer society we have to come up with good ideas get those ideas out there and then hopefully the good ones will stick and they will be the things that societies are built on and care about so I would say mainly if we can open up a little bit of a space to have those conversations if we can keep that space open right so we have this we have this opening right now and we know that it can't that it's being attacked on both sides let's say and generally more from the left but it's being attacked but if we can keep that space open well there's all sorts of rich conversations to have that are not reactionary in nature so when Jordan is talking about personal responsibility which you know this is an idea as old as anything out there that's not a reactionary position for whatever reason right now and perhaps more with young men there is a real need to understand what personal responsibility is there is a real need to clean your room get your life in order before you get the world in order and that's not a reactionary position yet it's an incredibly important position to right now we have constant conversations right now is there a difference between gender and sex or do these words even mean anything anymore well we can talk to evolutionary biologists like Brett Weinstein about that now that is maybe reacting to a conversation that's happening culturally but yes we have to figure out beyond just talking about these things is this a political movement is this is it a political party is this a road show is this a podcast network or a TV network or a cable news network or is it nothing are we of just a bunch of bounty hunters that are all and I don't mean bounty hunters and that we're all searching for bounty I mean that we're just a loosely affiliated group of people doing our own thing who occasionally come together and people like seeing us together I mean maybe that is what it is actually we're going to agree and disagree on things you know I think there's also advantages to not being that tightly associated with each other in case one person gets taken down yet at the same time there's strength in numbers so you know there are advantages to being grouped together as well but we'll we'll see but I would say the IDW is good at this it's good I don't think we've all sat there and been like all right well this is what this thing is and that's what it's gonna be and we're gonna go get it it's more that it's evolving as we're evolving with time and also we live in an extremely tumultuous time right now especially our political system our our media system all of these things seem to be shaking right now and we're trying to navigate through and again hold that hold that little space where people can stay in there and come along with us and then I think whatever it's supposed to be you know maybe Ben's supposed to run for office and you know Brett's supposed to start a university and you know Joe is supposed to get a TV show and you know we'll all go on our merry way but hopefully if we can hold this thing Society won't spin off into the oblivion because there's a there's a sense with a lot of the people in the IDW and I'd say Jordan does this kind of as well as anyone like there's a self-reflective Ness to it I remember at the end of one of your recent Rubin report shows I think I think it was Warren with Eric Jordan and Ben Shapiro perhaps you had a you all reflected on what you which criticism you thought were kind of valid and I think you said something about political PTSD which is something that breath and Erica talked about can you explain yeah well so the so the reason I asked the question at the end of that interview with with it was Eric Jordan and Ben was you know we have done some pretty heavy idea lifting during the hour hour and a half of that and I thought well what what could I ask them that's a little bit a little bit different a little more personal because people do want to know who we are and I can truly tell you that this this whole crew what you're seeing on camera with these guys these guys aren't actors I mean there are some people you sit down with and you know privately they're very shy or very quiet whatever then the camera goes on and they just light up these guys it's the same thing we've got to dinner it's the exact same conversations exact same interactions with each other all sorts of stuff but I've been thinking about it about myself that have I missed something do I have a blind spot here am i overestimating what post-modernism is doing for the left is there more of a threat on the right than I'm acknowledging I really was thinking that for myself and I thought well who better to talk about that with and question that with them than this crew so for myself I talk that maybe I have some level of political PTSD because I was part of the left I now see how they treat me and anyone who holds virtually or somewhat similar ideas as me I would say interestingly Brett who you referenced there who was the first one to say to me you know Dave you know maybe you have some version of political PTSD I suspect if we were to sit down with Brett right now he would probably be a lot closer to where I am than where he was then because he's now only being treated horribly by the left as a matter of fact I when I do stand-up now I usually I do about an hour stand-up and then I bring one of the IDW crew and I've brought your Deborah Cristina I brought both of the Weinsteins a couple other people and most of my audience now leans conservative I usually do a little fun poll I try to figure out where everyone's at and now you get Brett going up there and he talks about being a progressive and guess what they applaud him and they like him now he knows he can't go anywhere and get applauded by progressives so maybe I have a little political PTSD but I would say it's also a bit of just reality so I like asking questions like that you know Ben Jordan do you have a blind spot you know and and and are you aware of it and if it's that blind I guess you wouldn't know about it but that's how it also shows a little bit of a human part of this because we're people too I guess you're you're criticized more than anyone else because of your biography that saying I'm a liberal who's seen that the left has gone too far and some of the some of the criticisms are saying that that's some kind of an act I guess or always so some like my question I guess is first can you see that that is quite a powerful story like in a way the the concerns or the cynicism towards it is partly because that's a very powerful story in itself well I suppose it's a powerful story because any story about evolution your personal evolution is what a story is I mean every movie is about a character evolving you know you start somewhere and you end up somewhere else so I suppose that's a powerful human story but if the implication somehow is that I've done that I that I've somehow planned this or something like that it actually couldn't be further from the truth I mean the true truth is and you can watch I mean I would say anyone that that really believes this if you want to spend the time you can watch my direct messages in my interviews when I started waking up to this stuff watch my shows in fall of 2015 before Trump was elected and you can hear me saying I'm a lefty guys what's going on here we've got to stop labeling everybody we can't call everyone a Nazi because then when the real Nazis come you won't even know that we're painting ourselves into an intellectual corner we've got to be better at this as a matter of fact when I did the Prager you video which was titled why I left the left I never said the phrase that I left the left that was never uttered by me either in this room nor in that video and when the video went up that morning I was laying in bed and I got a notification and I was pissed because I was like wait a minute I'm still on the left and it's important that the left has counter voices because the whole problem here is that it's become a movement of groupthink now I quickly realized within an hour that the video was going so viral that is gonna be okay but can I honestly say I'm part of the left anymore of course not now if some of these guys if if Sam and Brett and and Eric perhaps or whoever else want to say they are I don't but I don't begrudge them that they should identify however they think they should but for me personally I don't know that anyone in this space has been more open about their evolution then I have I think that's partly why people care about what I do because they've watched me they've watched me learn they watch me change they've watched me actually Institute you know everyone talks about free speech everyone talks about tolerance and all of these things but I think people have actually seen me not only experience it but express it and that's scary to a lot of people so the people that criticized me well first off you're welcome to criticize me no one's above criticism that's fine but the truth is they just don't really want me talking about these ideas they don't want their Achilles heel to be exposed and that's that's the problem I mean there are a million shows on cable news and everywhere else where you can watch lefties and progressives talk about all sorts of things I created a little bit of space here where we criticize where often we criticize the left although that's not really the the purpose of the show it's I'll talk to anyone that's interesting but we happen to focus on that and what do they hate they hate an apostate more than anything else because this this this monster that we're fighting it is it does not want anyone to be free it is an authoritarian monster it wants to tell you how to think about everything and that's why if you were to take all of the lefty things right now that are out there I could tell you that I'm for a good portion of them but once you pick one that you're on the outside for you're really in trouble and then because of the ridiculousness of identity politics well if you're gay and against those things now you're really a sellout or if you're black and against those things now you're really an Uncle Tom or something else so I don't mind the criticism because I think if you're doing anything that's real and honest you're going to get criticism you know I find some of the criticism boring it's just these trolls you know all day long but but but I would say more than anything else legit criticism I'm worried than happy to discuss and I've done it many times by the way I'd like I mean Jordan Peterson has said before that he doesn't think journalists should just sort of play devil's advocate for the sake of it I think I agree with him on that that actually if I'm going to put a criticism to you it should be something that I actually think deserves a response and I do think a lot of the criticisms of you are not true that they're bad badly intent intentioned and I think I think you're right in the terms of being an apple state that is something that people really really riles people but even Sam Harris has said in the past that he thinks that you might have been captured by your audience and I feel that as well just in the pieces that we're putting out YouTube has a certain bias and I can feel it's something that Eric had said that the members of the IDW are free because they are independent of kind of organizations I don't actually buy that because there is there's a huge pull in terms of the audience in terms of what they want what do you think of that criticism by Sam well well I I know that was in an article and something or other I forget what it was in look I suppose at some level everyone that has an audience could have some level of audience capture so I'm sure I could say that about anybody I could could I tell you that Jordan maybe has some level of audience capture does Ben have some look Ben's audience loves it when he destroys a leftist on a college campus so is that something that he might do more of it even if he doesn't think it's the most high intellectual work he could do perhaps if Sam makes some joke about religion is that gonna get atheists who laugh probably so we could all play that game so without getting into the real nitty-gritty of that I would say look if I really if I cared about audience capture to the point where I wanted this just to be about garnering a bigger audience to make more money and all and that sort of thing I mean look at the way we treat our YouTube channel I mean you should anyone watching this could go look and we don't do clickbait we intentionally do things that I know we're going to get us less views which will ultimately get us less subscribers but we treat the channel and the material that we put out the same way I treat the conversations here so audience capture I don't know really don't know what that means I don't know how I I truly I don't know how I could be more honest with my audience than I am being when I don't know something I am willing to admit that and I'm willing to explore certain ideas so I think yeah there's no way that that can be answered that I think really can give a very satisfying answer other than I am truly doing what I think is right if people want to watch if they want to support they can can I tell you that there's no level of audience capture that I subconsciously can't even explain well the political PTSD you talked about before they're kind of more focused on the left well of course I'm more focused on the left I believe that this that the modern left that the postmodern leftist which now have taken over academia which have taken over the media which have taken over the political establishment of the Democrats I believe that is without question the biggest threat to individual freedom to Liberty and to human prosperity that exist that is far bigger a threat than I think Donald Trump is or even could be I think it's a far bigger threat than the alt-right or whatever that is I think this idea not to say this this group of ideas based in a competing set of interests where we have to put black people here and gay people here and Muslim people here and trans people here and this ridiculous system that will turn neighbor against neighbor it will literally will do that you will be walking down the street you will see your neighbor walking his dog and you will go off he's a cisgender white man he has privilege I should treat him this way ah here's a intersectional black disabled lesbian she should get this it's the most psychotic set of ideas that could ever be assembled and it is but in it is a threat now it has actually become a threat to the left so if having political PTSD is that I criticize the thing that I think is the most dangerous to Western society and to human freedom then I gladly have PTSD I would say we all focus on certain things also the funny part of this is no one focuses on this in the mainstream so the irony is I'm being criticized for calling out something I suppose that million and millions of people are seeing yet very few are willing to talk about so they watch these shows often privately because they don't even want their friends to know that they're listening to these shows so if I'm focusing there I don't see that as a problem I mean if used if you saw a problem would you just talk about it for a month and then be like and then the problem still existed or was getting worse I mean that's the irony right this thing is getting worse and worse and worse the ideas of democratic socialism are becoming stronger so why would I stop talking about them I don't think that's audience capture I think that's I see a problem and for whatever reason I'm not afraid to talk about how to stop it yeah and I would agree with you like the overall frame is what we're seeing is the Reid tribal ization of society and it's coming from the left it's coming from this the intersectional worldview that is not looking at the commonalities between people but it's looking at the differences between people and seeing those primarily I think that's absolutely true I guess my my genuine concern is and I've also been on that channel we've been a little bit critical of Jordan Peterson as well because I think sometimes his relentless focus and the kind of clear reactivity he can have around this stuff can actually be be more polarizing than than it would need to be sometimes and that it that it can be and I guess I'm coming from aspect evolve one as a journalist and two as someone who's really looking to see what is the place beyond all of this all of this conflict and my Michael the criticisms that I see any view that I think have some some validity is sometimes you draw this you talk about a new center evolving but you draw that new center around some people that that I would consider on the right like Stefan Stefan modern you for example well I've never said that stefan molyneux Zinn the new center i really have you ever heard me say that i thought you had no but people were so this is one of the things that people do before exams another example would be the Katie Hopkins interview yeah and Katie Hopkins I mean I know Katie Hopkins pretty well coming from the UK and the way that that interview was framed was that she was sort of being shut down for in a politically correct way but the actual article that she wrote was calling from gunboats to be used against migrants and compared them to cockroaches I mean that was did you know that about the article before the interview were we talking about a specific article yeah there's a specific article in you had an interview with her where it was framed you've sort of framed it as that she was investigated by the police for this article and this article was actually taken down by the paper that produced it she was interviewed by the police but in that article she called for gunboats to take on migrants and compared them to cockroaches right so so the interview was about two years ago I actually don't remember every specific instance of the interview I mean that's just that's just the truth I see I mean this is one of the strange things it's like everyone calls for more tolerance we should talk to people we should interview people we should sit down with people but then the second you actually do it then you're the enemy so it's like you know we should all be tolerant of people but now can Joe Rogan sit down with Alex Jones well a lot of people were really pissed about that now did anyone get killed because Joe Rogan's but he was he was criticized for not bringing up the Sandy Hook thing and then when he sat down with him again he did bring up the Sandy Hook thing you know in a fairly strong way okay and that that would be the question is that and the criticism that I've seen is that you don't push back hard enough against people when they maybe deserve it that you've given easy ride to people listen I would say I'm interviewing people the way I like to interview them I like to sit across from somebody look them in the eye and figure out what their ideas are and if you let them talk long enough if they have bad ideas or they don't know their ideas I've said this a million times you can actually watch them wrap the noose around their neck and hang themselves so are there specific instances over the course of however many hundreds if not thousands of interviews that I've done that maybe I asked a question in too much of a leading way or didn't have the perfect follow-up or something like that I'm sure there are I also have no I of being here I don't have a producer yelling at me what to do I'm doing this on the fly I very rarely look at my notes I'm actually sitting there and I'm trying to pay attention and do the follow-up properly in the rest of it could I have asked Stefan Molyneux some different questions perhaps I actually and I think I probably prepared for that interview more thoroughly than I had ever prepared for an interview because I knew what the fallout was gonna be no matter what I did if I did the greatest job I was still gonna get hate and if I did a horrible job I was gonna get hate I think the right question was the one that I repeatedly asked him which is which was why do you care about this I thought that was the right question now people can say I did a bad job or did a good job or whatever else I have often talked about a new center I can tell you that the new center that I would envision would have nothing to do with white nationalism just as it would have nothing to do with radical left ism so I don't know that I have talked about the phrase new Center but I don't know that I've ever said this specific person is part of it what do you say Mike so none of it just in the new center I mean so these are these are the type of questions that I don't think are that productive actually but I mean I'll answer it I don't think it's that productive because if we just start drawing lines everywhere and I get it I get why people want to draw lines and I get why countries have borders I mean they're you can't just always be absolutely open to everything do we want murderers in in the new center or something like that of course not I would say someone like Serna vich who maybe has done some trolli things or not maybe has done some trolli things has done some over-the-top things over the over time he was also part of the machine that broke the fake news monster that we've been talking about it attacked radical left ism in a certain way that perhaps the IDW couldn't do because we talk about things in a really decent way and a respectful way and not everyone always responds to that so somebody like milo i would view as a necessary piece of all of this because milo went in there and in his fabulous over-the-top ridiculous way also had an incredibly sharp mind and he blew up things and we were able to put some of those pieces back together so i would say some of those people are necessary i would also say that Serna vich has really evolved and i would say in the last year I think he's extremely mod I would say none Madhuri himself but I think he's he's becoming something I think much more rich or something in the last year or so so you know we could do this litmus test with the gajillion other people but I always do think it's funny people will only ask me this about people on the right right so you can ask me well is stefan molyneux in the IDW is Serna bitch in the new center but no one will say anyone no there's no left that's too far left to be considered I've never heard that question once and even if I would say I asked you that right now I'm guessing you can't even come up with somebody because that's just sort of a nature of it so yeah if we live in a free society you're gonna have to interact with some people that maybe you don't love and and maybe over time if you do it honestly you might actually be able to wake them up to some good ideas I guess what I'm what I'm saying the criticism is that do you think that you can sometimes slip into a fairly like it's such a powerful though there's so much truth in the idea that the left is constraining debate the left is kind of making certain topics off off off the off the table that that can turn into a bit of a simplistic narrative that's my concern is that if everything is seen through that narrative all the time and the reason I mentioned the Katie Hopkins piece is that I thought I don't know if you if you'd read the article before you've had her on but I did I did think the way that it was framed made it sound like she was some free speech martyr whereas actually the language she was using I feel hugely uncomfortable with I know Jordan Peterson for example talks about the danger of framing people in disgust language like he talks about kind of Hitler used to do that talking about people as vermin or as cockroaches and she'd done that in that particular article is one kind of coming back right so I would say this so we could I would answer it this way let's and this is the overall point I'm making do you think you can sometimes have a tendency to frame things in a way that is that is in some sense laundering people with much were much worse views or very like Katie Hopkins very difficult or very reprehensible views I don't think I've helped launder anyone's views to make their nefarious views let's say any more palatable I don't think I've done that let's pretend though that the Katie enter the Katie Hopkins interview they did was literally the worst interview ever let's pretend I just grant you that this was a V I just completely dropped the ball I misunderstood something and she's she's a true racist and all of these things I've done hundreds of interviews I would say if you know everyone gets one I would say you get one or two so you know when people focus on the two or three little things that they didn't like okay you know it's also the nature of how everyone views conversation these days because again I said everyone talks about tolerance but they don't really mean it they mean it they mean to be tolerant for the things that you like and I've tried to perhaps because of the PTSD of the left because the left has become so hysterical have I been a little friendlier maybe with people on the right that that maybe I wouldn't have been years ago perhaps but I don't regret any of those conversations I don't no one got hurt because of any of those conversations you know what's funny after the mob the molyneux one which you know people criticize me for all the time I got a lot of emails from people saying that you know they had heard about him sort of and then when I had him on and I asked him these questions that they actually just weren't that impressed with them so it's not like you get you sit down with someone and automatically you strengthen them there's no automatic maybe they'll be strengthened if their ideas are good and I don't think I'd ever argue that you shouldn't sit down with someone I think my main point is whether people are being challenged enough because and that goes back to my point before about has has it shifted because because now there are expectations I mean we're seeing this for Joe Rogan I think we're seeing this with you as well that there are expectations that you will hold people to account in a way that when you're an upstart kind of alternative media channel yes we're not there right so as I said earlier look the bigger you get the more relevant you get the more haters are gonna come out but the more that legitimate criticism will come out too and again I address this all the time what do you think is the most legitimate criticism it's not really for me to say what the legitimate criticism of me if someone wants to say that they don't like the way I interview that I don't ask hard enough questions or something like that well I suppose that is a legitimate criticism of me it's not the way I like doing my business and you know if you don't like what I'm doing then I would say you don't have to watch doesn't mean I'm doing it perfectly I'm doing I'm doing something that I believe is good apparently a lot of other people think it's good too and and apparently it's pretty rare these days so within that if I don't do it exactly how someone wants well I guess that's just that's just how life works but yes we are gonna be scrutinized more and I don't mind I don't mind scrutiny so I would say it's a it's a function of success which is which is good since the IDW is announced in probably maybe it's just over a year ago do you how has it evolved and how do you feel that your position within it has evolved well there is definitely an interesting moment for the IDW on the horizon as we roll into the 2020 election because you know I think we have people now let's say there's a certain set which I would say probably is ben shapiro jordan peterson myself maybe douglas mari that are a little bit more right-leaning at this point right and then there's the the other side which I said would say is the Weinstein brothers and Sam and a couple other people that are maybe a little more left-leaning now what's gonna happen is I think as we get as we roll towards the election of 2020 it's fairly obvious to me that the left for all intents and purposes and I don't mean every leftist obviously but the apparatus of the left and the media and the political establishment they've bought into the socialist Democrat view of the world they've bought into this postmodern view of the world now could any of us that are that are loosely affiliated with the IDF with the IDW could any of us possibly vote for one of those people I don't see how that would be remotely possible every single idea that they're putting out is the antithesis of everything that we've talked about here I mean everything that we've discussed that the IDW has talked about for lascal years has been against identity politics has been against these group associations and collectivism and all that now one side is really veering towards that the other side whatever you think of Trump is in estimation is not really veering towards that so I think there's gonna be an interesting moment for the IDW where it's gonna be like all right because we're we've been lefties and Democrats our whole lives or something like that well now can we possibly have to vote in a different direction and I think that's gonna be a very hard pill for some people as well that being said whether we all end up voting for different people are the same person or anything else I hope that we'll continue those conversations respectfully but I do think there's there is an interesting split in that regard I don't the last little bit of the guys that are saying the left is salvageable I don't think there's any evidence for it I think there's a plenty there are there's plenty of evidence that there's no nothing salvageable left so we shall see and this I guess is the sort of the broader context of what I see from the outside is there's almost like an America has is almost like machine for creating polarization even when something like the IDW is conceived as a space to hold the center it's still fraction eighths and I guess the sense you you just said that you're sort of feeling yourself pulled in one direction during it almost like the logic of the logic of the culture war now is that you're it's just always splitting well I would say the logical answer if you care about the ability to talk about the things we've been talking about related to science and related to gender and related to climate or political conversation any of those things there is it is obvious to me that the road right now as it is whether I want this to be or not the reality is that the road right now is clearly veering right it doesn't it's not going far right and somehow we're gonna become ethno nationalists and racists that's everything we're fighting against but the road where we're gonna be able to have these conversations is clearly going right right now now you may really want it to go left and you may be holding on to the steering wheel as hard as possible it's not that it can't go Center but I think sometimes if right now where we exist we can see some conservatives that are open to talking about ideas and we can see some libertarians who are open to talking about it is why not talk to them they're willing to do it so that is going to shift us I would say a little right now when you say right people some there's a there's a association that that somehow means authoritarian or scary what I would say right means is basically you believe in individual freedom and you believe in human liberty and limited government those are all good things that are completely congruent with all the ideas that we've we've talked about here but but interestingly you know when the article about the IDW came out you know that's when this thing really leveled up because finally it was in the New York Times so now you get the political establishment and the media establishment care and it was suddenly like within within 24 hours of that article coming out the amount of hit piece is written on us were we're insane and it's like ah so this really is how you guys operate we're out there we're building audiences we're having interesting conversations we're agreeing we're disagreeing and it's just building and it's and it's all actually quite pleasant and decent then we get in the New York Times and next thing you know all of the the usual suspects start coming out of the woodwork and you know we're racists and it's a group of white men and all of this nonsense and it's like all you guys really do is just react to things that are that are different than you you're proving our point yeah I guess that's that's my central point is that the paradox of the IDW is that let's create a space beyond polarization immediately in the American context becomes polarizing itself almost straight away so I would say that's probably a commentary more on just American political establishment or sort of media establishment more than the IDW itself I think all we could do and I would suspect if you ask this question to to any of the crew that we're talking about here I think most of them would say I'm interested in either doing the research that I want to do or having the conversations that I want to have or interacting with a certain type of person or whatever it is or you know maybe eventually writing laws that will lead to more freedom or whatever else and and that's it but I would say in the in the broad sense what is that can that exist forever I don't know if it can exist forever but I would I just think we have to just keep moving that's it if we just keep every week I try to do a show that I feel is relevant and it's honest and is the best show that I can do and I think that that has worth to people and you know if in five years from now there's 20 other people that are doing this better than me I'll find something else to do and who who are the figures on the left that you think are capable of having these kind of conversations that you would because because one of them oh I see well this well here's the irony right so I could so who are the people on the left that can have these conversations well Sam Harris is on the left right but that's not really what you mean right Bret Weinstein is on the left but that's not way when is recline Eric why is that on left but that's not what you mean as recline I mean you know I suppose if he wants to have a conversation with me sure but you know I view him basically as a bad actor in this space I mean you could watch you could listen to his podcast with Sam but but even more than that when that ridiculous data and society alternative influencer Network study came out which was not a study it was just a bunch of names with arrows drawing drawn to people where there were many mistakes by the way and the whole idea was that it was trying to link all of us to the all right and to real racist and they were trying to prove somehow that by watching ben shapiro or Jordan Pederson or Dave Rubin people are shifted to the right now they've actually done some follow-up studies Tim Poole has done a video on one where they actually proved that by watching our shows mostly we've moderated people the other way but Ezra tweeted out that article and even tweeted that this is for Dave Rubin that he was tweeting so I don't view him as someone that's a particularly good actor in this space you mentioned the alternative influencer report that's the Becca Lewis report I think yeah it was really interesting reading that how they seem to focus on you more than just about anyone else in that report yeah why do you think that is well I think as an interviewer I'm going to sit down with the most people now Brett Weinstein for example may sit down with some of us but it's not his job to sit down with people so as an interviewer I'm gonna sit down but as I've said many times look Larry King who again this is my mentor and I think is the best interviewer of all time in his heyday so picture 1991 CNN primetime Monday Magic Johnson Tuesday the cast of friends Desmond Tutu Thursday Bill Clinton Friday Jack Hannah the animal guy did anyone think he endorsed all of these views or liked all of these people no nobody you would have to be out of your mind to think that somehow now if you sit down with someone in 91 that was okay now in 2000 idea if you sit down with something you obviously love them and endorse all their views it's it's actually completely bananas I think that perhaps I'm most focused on in that in that data and society report partly because I'm an interviewer but also I in a weird way and this is this is I don't even think I've ever said this before and I don't take any great pleasure in this I'm the biggest threat to these people I have walked away from the left and survived I have no desire anymore to reform them they can go and do their thing what I see is a rich decent basically honest and open center right that I think could truly be a good future for America and I'm willing to go there and do that and I never get hate from them they can agree to disagree they keep inviting me places where I tell them my differences with them and I go to college gigs too conservative events and I go if you've got a disagreement come up first and guess what we always do it respectfully and shake hands at the end so in a weird way I'm a threat to them because I've shown my life experience which is not audience capture it's it's who I am my life experience has shown you can escape and you will be okay and that is the last thing they want to show because because leftism has become as Peter Bogosian said on this show it has become a secular religion it has all of the markings of religion except there's no Redemption narrative especially if you're a straight white man so they can't just have somebody walking away and living to tell the story so you know if they want to attack me for it it's okay they proven thank you very much [Music] you [Music]
