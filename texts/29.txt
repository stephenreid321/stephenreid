[Music] regular viewers of the channel will know that we've done quite a lot of stuff around gender quite a lot of stuff around masculinity and this is just such a big story and such an important moment to unpack and such a complex thing to unpack as well we were we were called by the Guardian yesterday for a quote and it just felt not appropriate to give a quote snowing on a journalist used to work in the media for quite a while so I know kind of how the quick turnaround news thing works and it didn't feel right to give a quote that then might be taken out of context because I think it's gonna take us at least 40 minutes and maybe more to really unpack it know you mentioned you work in the media I used to work in advertising as well so it's a very interesting moment for an ad to be this kind of cultural lightning rod you know I've having worked in an agency knowing how an ad is made and knowing all the different dynamics that go on within it it's it's quite an interesting phenomena to to observe yeah just for anyone who's been living under a stone for the last couple of days I haven't seen this I mean the amount of views that it's had it was up to about 9 million views in a very short space of time at two days hugely polarized reactions it was running about 10 to 1 dislikes to light ratio it's now up to about four to one which we'll talk about later because that already some people are questioning whether that's kind of completely authentic and it's really interesting I thought it was done in a way it's done very well because these things these huge amounts of budget behind it and it's very easy to get polarized into if you don't approve this then you must be a sexist you must be a misogynist but you look at the level of the response and either and there are some people that even I've seen people tweeting this is like whoa this was so needed because look at the level of response look at the level of there must be far more troglodytes misogynists out there than we realise by the response to this film and that's really unfair but I think to unpack it properly it's gonna take a little while to look at the cultural context to look at play a few clips from some of the people we've interviewed especially Warren Farrell because I think his perspective is really valuable in this in this point but let's let's start by talking about the film itself yes because it was done by a very high-profile director Kim Gehrig so a female director who did a very well-received and very successful campaign called this girl can and we're going to play a little clip from that now and we'll just sort of then unpack the differences and what it says about the cultural context Mississippi bring the damned I'm the hottest round y'all can stop me now [Music] this girl can't I think it's a great campaign it's actually by death by pretty much any definition was a great campaign it took a real need and a real issue which is women feeling like they didn't want to exercise because they didn't feel confident their bodies they thought people were watching them I have a lot of female friends who told me about this about the kind of feeling especially like in the freeway section of the gym like I really want to go in there so it took that need it did a great campaign around it and they got something like well according to an award entry they did you know 1.6 million women doing exercise attributable to some way in that to that campaign which is great so really different response to the Gillette ad and I think part of that is because so this girl can everything in there is aspirational is this girl can do this you can do this you can do this it's you know kind of don't hold me down great very empowering nothing wrong with that did you let add if it's this girl can it's very much these men should completely different energy to it yeah and I mean it's very early to start saying whether the Gillette had a success or not but the the way that it sort of raced to attend to one dislike ratio and then it's come back somewhat I don't know whether that's just cause a lot of kind of early adopters and people who kind of immediately hate clicked on the ads were kind of anti the message but there's a lot of suggestions that that Gillette are deleting some of the comments that there is in some sense they weren't expecting the responses they got and actually I think you picked out on one of the ad agency campaign campaign a kind of official Bible of the ad agency there's already been a senior ad person who said that this isn't a successful campaign yeah I'm pointing out Fernando de shoot who runs new macho who was also an X brand rector of links another brand that has men as their target audience that's interesting what he was saying about I thought was a really nuanced article he wrote I was actually surprised to see a major advertising publication put that out there so this is a guy he used to be the head of links links links and was responsible for links rebranding from probably American viewers will be aware of it but links especially in the 90s have really kind of crass advertising which was the idea was one of them was you spray yourself with links and a woman actually falls out of the sky like it like an angel you know they were kind of it was ridiculous and they had to they change their positioning to be a bit more mature and he did a very good job of that so he was pointing out the fact amongst many other things about why the campaign isn't so great is that it falls into the progressive mantrap he called it and way oversimplifies what we're men are really at as well you know he's on this research with looking at talking to 2,000 men and women and I thought one of the most interesting things he points out is that it's not that there's either progressive man or traditionalist men most men have are holding different viewpoints at the same time so I think they focus on the symptoms of masculinity saying okay the main crisis has symptoms men are more violent men are not well behaved with women they are not a man so they focus on that and not what was the underlying issues they focus on the symptoms if they didn't focus on men are in crisis why they are in crisis that is what I said in the article they are in crisis because they are performing who they are unknown being there so it is empower them to be who they are they said okay why don't we teach them how to be and that was then the execution and mistake that is this idea of teach them how to be and do it also in in a way that is not very Olympic so I guess I'm gonna frame this film that we're doing now it's gonna be we've done a whole series called men and women after me too based on the premise that if the cultural conversation right now looks like a dysfunctional relationship and I think it does what does a functional relationship look like and why I think Warren Farrell is such an interesting voice in this is that he was one of the earliest and most high-profile leaders of the feminist movement and then started doing men's groups listen to men's stories and then became known as the father of the men's movement and but his real skill and his real job is relationship counseling like he runs relationship counseling with his wife he's a therapist it's like you cannot have a functional relationship between men and women if one side is not allowed to speak the more I paid attention to the dialogues that were happy to though the the discussions that were happening in the men's groups I formed the forms of 300 men's groups and those were ways where men opened up and said what they felt in the safety of other men who were saying gee I didn't realize anybody else but me felt that and so but then when many of them when I started to incorporate those what I heard in the men's groups when I started to incorporate men's pain and feelings into my presentations of two groups at colleges and universities I found myself going from very large standing ovations large audiences standing ovations and always being invited back to two or three more speaking engagements versus slowly all of that dwindled and I knew that if I continued speaking and incorporating men's feelings and fears that I would continue to have fewer and fewer speaking engagements and I had to make a decision you know did I want to have you know now that I saw the formula did I want to be formula speak and have a huge income and do very well and be very respected and and and applauded or did I want to go ahead and and try to discover my best truth and speak up about that and try to represent and incorporate men and it while still retaining a compassion for women and and and make that part of my life and my my contribution and I decided at least I would try to incorporate the best truth that I could why I think this is really key right now is we're in a cultural context immediately after me to those it was actually said men now is not your time speak now is your time to listen absolutely I can understand that I think we've said before like me too was a valuable before it went too far was a valuable speaking up of women who perhaps had never felt able to have a voice have never been able to express some of the things they express fantastic and perhaps it was appropriate then for men to listen and women to speak but you can't stay there because by definition that is not a relationship it's not a relationship it can't be a relationship it's so where when we're both allowed to speak what would we be saying and we've also got a very quite a lot of lived experience lived experience for want of another problematic term because we leave men's groups and what we see so we see men coming to our groups with a whole range of different issues but one of the big things that we see almost all the time is men with a real sense of shame around themselves as men and I think that's such a big thing in the cultural context right now and it's not recognized it's not spoken to it's still like where we're operating in the 1950s almost where the big problem is just toxic masculinity and it's a really unbalanced picture and I think that's why this is such a difficult thing to unpick because if you went through the film frame by frame you probably agree with most of the pieces within it like yes I think I think as men we should kind of hold each other accountable I think we should aspire to be the best that we can be I think we shouldn't objectify women I think we should stand up for the underdog I mean all of these things are valuable but what is the cultural context that this is being put into yeah and I think the other thing just if I think back to what we experienced leading the men's workshops is that a lot of what we're a lot of what we are experiencing together is getting into a space where we're often Takai ourselves and we're not efforting we're not coming from a space of feeling inadequate having to prove ourselves by getting validation from the outside world I'll be the big tough-guy whatever it is we call we talk about relaxed confidence so it's a sense of being connected to myself being authentically me and from that space I don't need to act out in these ways now that comes from connecting to oneself that's an inner journey but we may do with others and with the support of others but ultimately that comes from a place within and one thing that is difficult about the ad is that it is effectively telling people how to behave you know and I think the the refrain and the thing they have in the description is say the right thing act the right way and that for me and I totally agree with you now looking at individual points in the film it's like yes well I mean that's being a decent person of course I'm not going to disagree with a lot of that in the wider context and the bizarre situation of Gillett a razor company telling men to say the right thing act the right way hey who are they to say it and be what axioms are they basing that behavior on I mean it's usually that's the domain of religion or philosophy to to decide what are the right ways to behave how do we you know it's very bizarre and it's an open question I'm very curious what is the right way to behave and the right way to think and behave and you know according to to the left just and just to preface a potential counter-argument which I've seen to this point which is that brands because they have so many they have such a big audience that they have a moral worth but they do have a moral responsibility to tackle issues and look at social issues okay let's assume that's true and I think there's something in that brands do have a huge audience and you know brand having a social role is not necessarily a problem in and of itself but the nature of that role and the way it's executed can be a massive massive problem and you know in love ways I think a lot of the pushback with Gillette has been this is far too much and the toning which is slivered is condescending it's patronizing and the big issue goes back to that you know think the right way act the right way it's not really okay for anyone to say that you know there's no sense of inquiry into okay what is it like for men what's going on let's have a really open discussion it's more didactic so yeah I think the cultural context is the really important piece recently there was an article in The Washington Post why can't we hate men now you could say that's an outlier but for that to be commissioned by a mainstream publication when no one could even imagine commissioning something why can't we hate women it's it's a very it's this idea of do men men do not have to fall for women to rise and the other point very recently even at about two or three days ago there were the APA guidelines which were clearly ideologically driven and were criticizing aspects of traditional masculinity which included they described a stoicism ambition for the sake of it in the end they were forced to issue a clarification and that clarification ended up pretty much saying well men who pursue their own goals at the expense of everybody else are dangerous and bad and in the end they ended up describing a psychopath like Psychopaths are bad it's like well okay so why did you call it traditional masculinity I think Warren Farrell makes a really interesting point as well about how the cultural conversation is going right now where let me see in the workshops men are really quite confused and and kind of scared about it feels like a lot of people feel like they're walking on eggshells I think part of that is because there's a huge social pressure to be more vulnerable speak more but then at the same time Warren Farrell points us out there's an equal pressure to shut the hell up and listen on one level we have a narrative that says men need to be much more in touch with their emotional side they need to be much more men lock things down and that's really bad and women often complaining about that and then on the other side when men do say how they're feeling they're often described as whining or complaining and there's a little compassion for it this is exactly accurate and this is that this is one of the challenges that we need to really confront is that that we say men speak up share your feelings it's like Lois Lane and Superman Lois Lane wanted and begged Superman to cry but she has zero interest in hearing about anything from Clark Kent women do want to hear men's feelings and hurts and pains if they're assured first that their Superman that they're the protector but when they meet Clark Kent and he's more open about his feelings and his pain this just turns the women off and women don't understand this about themselves they think that oh you know my husband really cried when his old when his mother was dying of cancer I really supported that so doesn't that mean I support a man expressing his feelings the answer is yes and no you ears you're supportive of a man expressing his feelings what he's when he has empathy for someone else's pain you're not often support or look more introspectively about whether you are open to a man expressing his feelings of anger or hurt or upset about something that you did but when you experience it as a criticism from your husband from your boyfriend oftentimes your boyfriend experiences you as backing off as being less willing to be sexual less willing to be emotionally open being more distant from him after that he needs your love he wants your love when he expresses what hurts him and gives him pain and he sees that you back off he tends to repress it because everybody else as well as you in the society has encouraged him to back off from expressing his weakness in any culture there will be some misogyny but there will also be misandry because of I mean misogyny comes wrong you have a negative experiences as women you have a bad relationship with your mother or whatever and that can get internalized and some we see if that's that that acts out and I think but the art the topic of misandry where women have bad experiences with men bad upbringing was bad romantic experiencing and then internalized a generalized resentment towards men there is it's not most people don't even know what the word misandry means and what's really I don't think enough people recognize water the the culture that we're in for example we did an interview with Cassie J who did the the red so it's a film about the men's rights movement she went into that film genuinely as a feminist who was going to do an expose on the men's rights movement and she had her mind changed during this film we've interviewed her I've met other people who were involved in the film I have no doubt that her journey was genuine she was convinced there were issues around men's rights that were not being reflected in the culture and what was the reaction to that to her film in another universe she would have been seen as a feminist hero she produced a very intelligent documentary in a very difficult area to make any kind of money in whatsoever and was very brave she would have been seen as a feminist here but because she didn't have the right opinions the film was attacked she was given a mauling on most of the kind of mainstream TV channels that she went on to this happened we recently put out a piece also by Heather huiying who the evolutionary biologist around toxic femininity to say okay both toxic femininity and toxic masculinity are very problematic terms but if we're going to have one then let's have the other as well and see let's have that let's have that conversation I mean I think the whole framing around is is dodgy but let's let's at least bring in both sides of the conversation so that I think is the cultural context of why people are reacting to this it's because it's part of a non perhaps overreacting to it as well because it's part of an ongoing narrative that has come from the university's postmodern relativism and has been increasingly pushing out into the culture at large and I think this is the key thing in terms of the cultural context to understand I've seen a lot of people asking and I think with genuine confusion why is anyone upset about this ad you know how did anyone have a problem with men acting this way and as we said before it's not necessarily the behaviors that are going on it's that within the framework of what you just mentioned of let's just lay out the system basically of what this kind of the kind of postmodern worldview is and why it matters to this conversation so it breaks the world down into identity groups and then also breaks it that work reduces everything to power relations so that's one thing going on within that framework men especially with the kind of the way third grade feminism is going right now maybe not where it came from but the way it goes in some circles men are at the top of that hierarchy by definition it doesn't matter what Batman you know what his situation is by by virtue of his group identity he's at the top of that power hierarchy so in this extreme form he's the cause of all the world's ills is inherently in a position of power and privilege and therefore needs to be in some sense and has been throughout history yes as well yes exactly and and from that what I've noticed is a sense of men are inherently dangerous and they need to be taught how to behave and they need to you know we've talked before about this idea of testosterone itself being kind of a poison and you know little boy and this does happen little boys in school being told not to roughhouse being you know forced into behaving in a way that's more conducive and less masculine all of that is going on and it comes from a sense of it comes from a very specific worldview and yes and it's rampant in critical theory and universities in particular in its most extreme form and I think a lot of people have a slightly more nuanced take on this particular kind of ideology but on it's mostly in its most extreme form it obliterates any nuance it obliterates it fails to appreciate that men commit suicide at a far higher rate than women do men are imprisoned a far higher rate there are far more male failures there are a group of hyper successful men and there are a lot of male failures at the other end what some people have called the greater male variability hypothesis and also obliterates the fact that throughout most of history men were self-sacrificing for their families they were going to war they were sacrificing their life their lives and their futures for others and this is completely missed in this kind of idea that men were just hauling all the power and privilege to themselves it kind of feels like we're we're stuck in a dysfunctional relationship between men and women that is now manifesting everywhere and Warren you've you've done work with with relationships for an awfully long time do you see that parallel and if so what do we do about it yes we are we are definitely caught up in an in a dysfunctional relationship that would be kind men we know we're asking men to you know to sort of express their feelings recognizing that we're repressed we're so repressed that we're the sexes that commit suicide and at a level of six times to 6 to 1 over women when we're in our 20s and when we're 85 and older at 1,350 percent greater amount than women and if that's not dysfunctional and tell me what is now suicide is probably the ultimate so in order for us so we are wanting men to open up on the one hand and then we're saying don't mansplain you've dominated the conversation shut up this is time for women to speak up this is time for men to shut up so the totally contradictory messages that men are getting told that they're filled with power and privilege and yet walking around in reality feeling shamed and fearful and that women have a type of power that they're not even allowed to talk about because they're the ones with the power and the monopoly over it so it's it's that is about as dysfunctional as it can get we have to understand that we have these attractions to each other for for fundamentally dysfunctional reasons we were never designed to be functional we were designed to survive and now we have the opportunity for the first time in human history to be functional as well as surviving and this is a whole new dialogue that needs to be together but though feminists have monopolized that dialogue of women good men bad women the oppressed men as the oppressors and that's about as dysfunctional as you can structure a dialogue it's as it's like a person going into therapy and saying I came here because you know my wife is filled with problems and and I have been telling her what to do for many years and she doesn't pay any attention to my direction and she's a 100% wrong on these 14 different items and I'd like you to help align with me to help you understand how wrong she is by the way if you do align with me I will continue hiring you as a therapist I control the money but if you don't align with me that'll be the end of you as a therapist and we're basically having feminists say to the world if you want to teach in gender studies you have this party ideology to follow you have to believe you have to articulate that men we live in a patriarchal world dominated by men that made rules to benefit men at the expense of women and if you don't follow that ideology there's not a chance in that you'll get a job at any decent university unless that ideology is at your forefront and you just have your own unique ways which we give you many unique ways no problem at all as long as you have unique ways of expressing that ideology as effectively as possible to your to your students and do not deviate from that or allow anyone else to come into this university to talk in a different way about that and so you cannot define it would be hard to write a novel with a fictional situation that would be more of a dysfunctional dialogue the the monologue than the monologue that is happening now well you know we've we used to have a battle of the sexes that's been historical but now we no longer have a battle of the sexes we have a war in which only one side has shown up the other side called men have put their heads in the sand and hope the bullets will miss that's a dysfunctional dialogue I've had conversations with people where they have simply denied that women have any power whatsoever which is ludicrous in in a patriarchal system it's impossible for a woman to have power even in the sexual realm and I'm having a conversation where they were the nine even that women have power in the sexual realm which is not only just bizarre but it also it's incredibly demeaning towards women it's demeaning saying you you're saying that women have no power and no agency throughout history until the 1960s really I mean that's just a completely ludicrous perspective to be coming from yeah but it makes perfect sense in that in that postmodern context we were talking about before where you you cannot let go of the victimhood you can't let go of it because it's where your power comes from in that game so you have to no matter what evidence is presented in the world around you matter how different the world is now than it is that it was in the 1950s you must still if you adhere to that particular religion let's call it you must still maintain that you are the victim and that and then you have to find other victims as well they it gets kind of a you know people called it race to the bottle if we grant that women didn't have a voice in public until the 1960s which i'm which i think is is pretty true and where we're hearing women's voices women's stories for the first time for the last 50 years have we really heard men's emotional truths at all because it was never part of traditional masculinity that men would be emotionally vulnerable so ok we've we've only listened to women for about 50 years but how long have we been listening to men's deeper truths about their experience we have to realize that the male-female evolutionary dance has evolved as a tango for millions of years and it's very important that women speak up about what they do and don't like about their parts of the tango and that we recognize that there are thousands of different women from different backgrounds who have different answers to that question that women don't just have one message to deliver on that issue at the same time all the exact opposite is also true it is not true that we haven't listened to women we haven't listened to women speak the feminist message for more than a half-century but we haven't listened to men express their feelings ever at all that was exactly the opposite of what masculinity was about so let's open up and hear boys and men's stories but what do we need to do we need to know how to listen so on the subject of men's kind of emotional stories not being heard it's also quite closely linked to that idea of men being forced to play certain roles or you know for whatever reason playing certain roles I think one of the best criticisms of the Jillette ad is actually from Fernando the advertising guy we talked about earlier where he points out that they are effectively doing exactly the same thing in that ad they are saying you must perform a certain role to be the right kind of man so Gillette is really doing what Gillette was doing in the 1950s this is how to be the right kind of man and they're doing exactly the same thing so they are effectively just I'd say moving the goal posts repackaging it and the core problem remains the same of pressuring and shaming people into behaving in a certain way and hidden within that is the idea that unless you are threatened or compelled to act in that way you won't act that way that men by their nature are not good that there is something inherently toxic about masculinity about men and that's what's what's terrifying is that unless you're under this compulsion to to rein yourself in and behave you will act out and that's that's really that's toxic yeah and it's not true I just think of as soon as you say that I think of the many beautiful moments of male support and brotherhood we've seen the workshops I would quite like anyone who wants to mature let marketing team to come to a workshop but just to witness it just to see how absolutely off the mark that is and how absolutely damaging and toxic it is to put that message out there they make a big show about the boys of the future you know the boys right now will be the men of the future telling boys right now that there's something inherently wrong with them because of their sex that's gonna cause problems when they're men of the future so thank you for watching we're gonna put the links to all of the other films below in the show notes the Warren Farrell and all the other men and women after me two films that we've done and I want to say thank you
