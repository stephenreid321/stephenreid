[Music] wanna start with evolutionary psychology I don't know a huge amount about it but I know it's a relatively new discipline compared to many other disciplines could you just give the sort of potted history explainer of what evolutionary psychology is conceptually evolutionary psychology is just trying to understand human nature human nature in terms of what challenges our ancestors faced in prehistory how did they survive how did they find mates how did they reproduce raise kids find food all of that so we try to understand a lot of that from archaeology anthropology hunter-gatherer studies behavior genetics etc emotionally though evolutionary psychology I think is basically respect for our ancestors it's realizing that we're descended from a long line of successful people and pre people you know hominids and animals and it's paying attention to what did they do that worked and what strategies would have succeeded or failed and kind of thinking really hard about that so for me it's been partly a scientific journey of figuring out human nature but emotionally and maybe even politically it's been a process of kind of reconnecting with my ancestors and I think everybody who works in the field for more than you know a decade or two has both of those components to it and you mentioned politically then it's really interesting because you're you've written for couette you're kind of in this car I've seen you on Twitter you're kind of in this intellectual dark web conversation and is that somewhere that you've always been or is that partly because of what you've the journey you've been on through your work I think it's partly a scientific journey partly it's a sort of personal experiences of running with social justice activists or certain kinds of trouble partly it's just maturing and having certain experiences as a man as a dad you know and as a partner I mean I started out college pretty standard lefty I actually joined the men's feminist union freshman year at Columbia and I had pretty standard liberal / libertarian views like I was in the era of Reagan being president in America and I was completely appalled that he got re-elected in 84 when I was in college like how could anybody vote for this actor right and then my journey since then has been partly kind of being radicalized as a libertarian in grad school and then getting just kind of increasingly appreciative of certain kinds of traditionalist and conservative views but also getting kind of radicalized even farther left on other issues so it's a kind of complicated patchwork and it does seem that in this sort of network around Colet around this kind of conversation there are quite a lot of evolutionary biologists evolutionary psychologists is this because of the nature of the discipline you think I think the discipline makes you very wary of certain kinds of claims that come out of the left like the mind is a blank slate and we can completely re-engineer men and women according to whatever happens to be politically correct we get very skeptical about that I think partly at the moment it's the people who are actually willing to do evolutionary psychology have to have extremely thick skins and have to be prepared to really battle for their ideas in an academic environment that's largely hostile to them and really punishes and stigmatizes them so I think it kind of selects for certain ornery personality types evolutionary psychology can you just summarize what it is for people who don't know because I understands the relatively new discipline yeah it's mostly just an excuse to go back to the 1950s gender roles to keep women barefooted pregnant ya know it's a lens with which to view human psychology so it's a way of generating hypotheses and predictions based on what would have been adaptive so we think about things in a variety of different ways and so if you saw a robot in the desert and you saw that it was moving around and you saw that it had survived there for some years you would know that it had certain features you would know that it was resistant to sand erosion you would know that it was able to actually use the Sun potentially at power itself you would know it had certain characteristics and we know just on the basis that humans have survived on earth for many millions of years in our current form in and other forms and have reproduced that we have certain characteristics and that we lived in groups and that we lived you know for some period of time on the African savannah and all of these different things lead us to have some idea about how human psychology might function if you were going to design a program in order to survive and reproduce to attract mates to increase your status to engage socially to help get other people to help you and to help others what kinds of programs would you implement in order to make those things happen and evolutionary psychology thinks about things from that perspective but also from a biological and ecological perspective looking at humans kind of as animals I think that one of the main things that happened and people was you know diverse as you know BF Skinner and ecologists and evolutionary psychologists think that in some sense we're too close to our own lines to have a good idea of what we really think and many of the people who have come up with these amazing insights into human condition were people who were like we know what Oliver Sacks called anthropologist on Mars people who felt alienated from other humans they were trying to figure them out and they were able to think about things in a novel way in a foreigner kind of way because they didn't actually feel entirely human and I think that evolutionary psychology tries to have an objective perspective on human minds in that way as well yeah because he you mentioned at the beginning kind of joking about kind of wondering we're going to return to the kitchen but there is an like when there is suspicion around maybe eeveelution arey biology as well but evolutionary biology evolutionary psychology it is that by looking at differences between men and women what we're actually doing is wanting to go back to the 1950s for example why how do you sort of respond to that criticism I just think you when you look at most evolutionary psychologists they talk about things yeah like hunter-gatherer life like non-human animals there's really no moralizing at all around it now there's some people who are kind of neo-traditionalist who talk about evolutionary psychology as a way to bolster some claims but certainly human beings were not monogamous at all and there was certain you know men mostly had at least some high status men had multiple mates and that's not anything that people are arguing for even though that's what you might argue from an evolutionary perspective because 80% of all societies have been polygynous so how I respond to that claim is yes some people use evolutionary psychology to bolster the traditionalist view but then you also have people like Christopher Ryan trying to use evolutionary psychology to bolster the view that we should all have multiple lovers and that we should all be polyamorous and a little bit like the Bible in that sense you can kind of use it to bolster what claims you want but I think all of these people get certain things wrong I think Christopher Ryan gets a lot of things wrong I think Jordan Peterson gets things wrong Brett Weinstein about evolution and how humans have evolved especially in terms of romantic relationships and I remember on the Rubin report you talked about that there are certain topics that you're wary about teaching what are those topics and are they ones that you don't teach anymore you're just a lot more cautious about the way you teach them some of them I don't really touch at all because there's almost no right way to approach them so for example trans issues transsexuality I've taught a human sexuality class for about 20 years I know a reasonable amount about trans issues but you know if you have a class of a hundred students and there's even one or two been radicalized and certain view of trans issues and trans rights and I give a lecture about it and it's not pitch perfect in terms of what I say I can get into big trouble about that on the other hand if I talk about things like the history of gay rights I'm totally comfortable with that because I can say things that are factually correct I was actually you know in New York as an undergrad when act up and the AIDS crisis hit and I'm very familiar with what a challenge that was to to gay people I'm totally comfortable talking about polyamory open relationships BDSM kink lots of that stuff but then when you get into things like sex differences and personality traits or cognitive strengths then I have to tread quite carefully again there seems to be an all-out attack on on gender per se in some areas of of the left at the moment and I guess if you're studying in a gender differences than you're in the in the process it's a really weird moment in relations between the sexes where on the one hand you get a kind of wholesale denial of sex differences by a lot of the left on the other hand you get a demonization of men right like everything that's wrong in history is due to men and patriarchy and it's almost like on the other hand on the one hand there's no essential sex differences on the other hand the core essential sex difference is men are evil and I don't know how we're going to reconcile those views but it makes very very difficult kind of intellectual landscape to navigate at the moment and you mentioned masculinity and some people called a war on masculinity at the very least we have a war about masculinity I think you could kind of safely say and a big part of that recently seems to have been I mean the Gillette I have caused a lot of response but in a way the APA guidelines the came close to pathologizing traditional masculinity were in some ways more concerning would you what what did you make of those at the time yeah the Gillette ad at the end of the day is just an ad it's just a consumer campaign that sort of woke capital it's just taking social justice concerns and trying to monetize them and trying to reposition the Gillette brand given that it's being challenged by kind of new rising hipster brands like Harry's on the other hand the APA division 51 guidelines that they published a couple months ago are concerning because APA has the power to tell every clinical psych grad program in America how to teach certain issues like we actually face APA accreditation in my department we train most of the clinical psychologists who practice in the state of New Mexico in the US and so whatever APA says is kind of a as a top-down ideological you know mandate and if they have a view of here's how to treat male clients when they come to you that's how clinicians will be trained to deal with men and I think what they've done is appalling disgraceful anti masculine and outrageous and when they got the blowback they didn't say oh my gosh we should be a little humbler about this we should rethink this no they double down and they said we know best we know the research I was like have you guys read any evolutionary psychology or animal behavior anything about evolved sex differences no they don't make any reference to that because it's not in their world worldview so I think that's where you get the danger that there might be you know millions of American men going to individual therapy couples therapy marital therapy family therapy most psychotherapists are women who don't have a very deep understanding of masculinity and these guys are going to be kind of hung out to dry by this therapy industry couldíve the people who maybe weren't familiar with the with the furore ii when it exploded could you explain what happened and why it was so dangerous in your view I think the short answer is basically APA Division 51 guidelines said for a man to succeed in psychotherapy he basically has to become more like a woman he has to get more in touch with his feelings share more of his secrets be more empathic he has to get away from any historical archetypes of masculinity right he can't act like a hunter a warrior anything Jordan Peterson would advocate guys should be like and he basically has to purge himself of any hint of traditional masculinity and adopt what 21st century femininity or some as-yet-undiscovered form of masculinity that nobody even knows how to do therapy about so I think that's the danger that it basically deal Ajith amaizing the kinds of masculinity that I think are actually most helpful particularly to young men and what are those types of masculinity I think getting in touch with and getting in touch with your sexuality your sexual desires your the ways that you view women trying to make those both consistent with your evolved desires but also kind of find your ethical path towards being open honest respectful towards women I think it means finding a way to reconnect with other men through friendship through groups through sports particularly combat sports it means yeah getting in touch with the the inner under warrior husband/father all of that and of course we have to reinvent that to some degree for the 21st century but I think it's really useful to start with a fairly traditionalist view of a lot of those roles and that's what a PA was was rejecting so does traditional therapy not work so well for men is it more oriented towards a woman's way of being in the world yeah I mean Freud invented psychotherapy mostly to deal with female patients to deal with fairly neurotic unhappy depressed and anxious Viennese bourgeois women and to talk with them about their issues and I think for women talking about your issues particularly with your female friends or your sometimes your male mate can be good therapy I think for a lot of men in a way the last thing they want to do is talk about their vulnerabilities and their neuroses particularly with a woman I think it's often humiliating I think it's often counterproductive it seems like if a guy is going to do individual psychotherapy on the one hand it might be more productive to do it with a guy who actually understands you on the other hand most guys now are actually more comfortable sharing their secrets with a woman because women are like better listeners and they're more used to that so the whole therapy industry I think is deeply dysfunctional when it comes to dealing with male clients I think it's often pretty good at dealing with female clients so how does evolutionary psychology influence what your view of masculinity was what what lessons can we learn from evolutionary psychology about this topic I think a lot I mean to me the the more you understand evolution and biology and animal behavior and ancestry and hunter-gatherer lifestyles the better you can connect with your your true nature as a man and the better you can understand your sort of path from puberty through young adulthood to maturity and fatherhood and becoming a mentor and and so forth I think to understand your sexuality when you're an adolescent male it's it's virtually impossible if you don't know some animal behavior and you don't understand how sexual selection shapes males and females differently and how it's done that for at least you know four thousand species of mammals and three hundred species of primates and that this is really deep stuff and it's kind of programmed into us to do things like seek sexual variety sexual novelty it's not necessarily about you know spreading or seeing in kind of a simple-minded way like every man wants to be an alpha Genghis Khan it's not that simple but to a first approximation that's closer to the truth than what most young men are taught right which is that all of your sexual desires are basically ethically illegitimate and you should act more like girls in high school and what else helps I think understanding status seeking and how male status works and how like there's different kinds of status that you can seek this formidable 'ti which is are you physically capable of fighting and sort of overcoming then there's dominance which is more about your attitude and how you carry yourself how you talk to other people particularly other men there's status which is how respected are you people heard of you there's prestige which is what do you know do people want to hear from you and learn from you all these different things young men confuse them like they don't know they don't know the difference between formidable 'ti in terms of like winning a jiu-jitsu match versus prestige which is people seeking you out for advice so I think understanding sexuality understanding status seeking that's just two examples where an evolutionary viewpoint really buys buys you a lot and obviously you're looking a lot at the differences between men and women and what do you make of the way that conversation looks at the moment in so the media and the culture yeah well obviously there's a lot of very adversarial kinds of conversations happening in different kinds of subcultures so there is a sort of radical feminist movement that has a view of men as being yet really bad and that actors generally but this impression that they have is that men are bad actors and they're toxic their starts with toxic masculinity masculinity can't even say it because of the way that men have been socialized and men are superficial eyes by women so I usually don't understand in that whole you know how that all would work and then there's also you know pickup artists and red pill kinds of communities which also have a kind of adversarial relationship to women which in some sense they're talking about trying to get one over on women so if men are trying to maximize the amount of sex they can have a as investment when they're trying to maximize investment and give away as little sex as possible and if you look at rap music which is one of my favorite sources for thinking about evolutionary psychology you see this kind of interaction a lot this kind of battle of the sexes interaction and if you look at those kinds of men they're kind of trying to get one over on women and in some sense they're radical feminists are trying to get one over on men but by saying that they are bad actors and that there's toxic masculinity so that's all happening and then I think the average person who's trying to engage with the opposite sex they don't know how much of their desires how much of what they're trying to do with one another is socialized how much they should reinvent things or how much they should go along with how they've been socialized or how they feel most naturally to act and you have some friends who have been in radical leftist communities and they tried to forge a new relationship kind of from the ground up try to negotiate who was going to do each task tried to really challenge sex differences in their own relationship and it constitutes a tremendous amount of strain and argument and sex roles you know whoever you think they come from actually very valuable for saving time and reducing the amount of stuff that you have to negotiate about they get a really bad rap so I think there's a lot of confusion and there's also this adversarial dynamic that really doesn't need to be there and you mentioned the idea of toxic masculinity was a huge discussion around toxic masculinity in the culture and there's very little discussion of toxic femininity and maybe we need to ditch both of those terms but we didn't it really interesting interview with Heather high end where she talked about that and it's been one of the most popular pieces we've put out so there's clearly a hunger for at least a discussion of the other side of the coin what do you think the other side of the coin is there is I think I mean toxic masculinity is a little bit easier to pick up because I think that men have tried to achieve status and dominance in a more narrow way so they've had to achieve that with physical strength with aggression and also yeah subjugation so all of that is ways that men have made a living for millions of years whereas I think the way that women have made living is more through psychological means you could call it manipulation or you could call it yeah you could just call inflation and so when I saw that piece she was saying it's toxic femininity to say that to tell a man that he shouldn't look at an attractive woman or to tell men that they shouldn't engage in shows of strength or shows of dominance that they shouldn't kind of do what's coming naturalism I would think of toxic femininity in another way which is the same way that men are sometimes driven to manipulate others through strength dominance and aggression women are often inclined to manipulate others through psychological means through manipulation through insults and carrots and sticks and engaging in reputational damage and women have some women more than others obviously there's huge individual differences in this respect have a role map of everybody's relationship to them who owes them what and you see this kind of thing I would call that maybe the other side of the coin of toxic femininity which is this desire to control others and you could see some ideological changes for example this desire that there would be parity in every different scientific domain as a way of actually engaging a manipulation that will improve the law of women so that's what I think maybe the other side of the coin toxic femininity this you know desire to manipulate things to one's own end especially in close social relationships and it seems that that like even that definition that kind of discussion feels quite countercultural at the moment but there isn't much of a discussion about it in the media or in in the culture at large why do you think that is well you can it's very hard to spin I'm engaging in dominance against you and aggressiveness against you as in this is for your own good but obviously there's a lot of ways to spend other kinds of psychological manipulation as this is actually the best thing for the culture this is the best thing for the in-group this is the best thing for people's relationships with it on another so if you look at therapy culture in that men should be more revealing of their weakness and vulnerability and they should talk out their problems more often for example that is a way of saying men you could be better and happier and more psychologically healthy if you engaged in this thing another way of thinking about it is actually a way of trying to whittle away at the ways that men feel most comfortable engaging with the world and engaging socially right you've had there's a very easy way to put a positive spin on it and if you had a very cynical view about what's actually happening in the culture then it's obviously easy to turn that on you and say that you're misogynist or that's your anti-feminist in a way that it's not easy to turn on somebody who says aggressiveness is bad which people tend to agree with have you been described designs like feminists i've been described as an as a feminist yeah and i think i've even described as engaging in casual misogyny which I like better than formal misogyny you know can wear your sweatpants I'm what did you make of that when it happened why why did it happen and what did you make of it yeah I've been called an anti-feminist I don't I mean the kinds of things that people hurl at you and then having him in an ad hominem way I don't really think about them very much they're not very sophisticated criticisms so I I think that as an evolutionary psychologist generally because it's such a controversial field and because I've worked on some controversial problems I have a fairly thick skin anyway and it's very easy for me to ignore somebody's unsophisticated commentary but also I grew up in a culture and in a family where we were constantly arguing we're constantly engaging in light-hearted ribbing and salting each other and I think that that has possibly also been very good preparation even though I didn't know at the time for the world of you know the internet and Twitter where people say awful things all the time but it can be very funny if that's all they have to say I guess the issue is that when especially people on the left hear people talk about an evolutionary viewpoint what they hear is we have to go back to pre 1950s gender relations [Music] I think that's a willfulness reading of what evolutionary psychologists are talking about so there's the stereotype that says oh me and David boss and Bob rivers and whoever else tells evolutionary psychology just wants to recreate fifties gender roles no serious evolutionist I know sort of advocates that that's like the default because we know hunter-gatherer societies are really really different from suburban America right we lived in tribal groups we had multiple friends we did shared childcare people didn't do monogamous marriage for life they did form pair bonds but you know sexual relations more were more fluid the men didn't go off like 40 hours a week hunting they were around quite a bit and then they would go off on multi-day hunting trips and then come back and the women would not stay like in a cave they would go off foraging and some of them would stay back and look after kids so nobody's advocating fifties suburban America as some evolutionary default that is a fiction of the left that is created purely to diss evolutionary psychology and you were one of the people who wrote in defense of James d'amour I think that was quill let's kind of break through article back in 2017 would it have been sounds right sounds about then and James d'amour was a really very interesting moment because it was I'm sure it kind of put a huge fear of God into just about everyone inside the tech industry and I think still is a really important cultural moment what did you what did he make of that and what do you think it shows about kind of the media and cultural landscape that we're that we're in at the moment so I wrote sort of a very short thing for quill at that basically said James d'amore is factually correct about most of his claims about sex too it says and then I wrote a longer piece called the neurodiversity case for free speech that pointed out look James the Moors kind of ass be like he's got some Asperger's syndrome traits which is like he loved systematizing information he's not naturally that empathic with people of other views he can be a bit blunt in how he says things I'm a speii I totally relate to that and I basically said we as a society have to choose do we censor every aspeed person from saying what they really think and making them super cautious or do we give them a little slack to say what they really think and to expect sometimes they will get it wrong or there'll be a little tone deaf or you know maybe they'll be a little bit over systematizing in terms of like well this is what the facts say so these are policy implications the response to temor I think from the left from the social justice activist was basically a speech out to fuck off we don't want to hear from you if you can't tow the line about what we consider appropriate ideologies then you are not welcome in the public sphere and I think all the you know all the ass because in the tech industry heard that message loud and clear and some of them were like to hell with you we're gonna say we want anyway but most of them buckled and like okay I guess that's professional landscape we face and what do you make of the kind of the media what you might call the media consensus around sex differences around these kind of topics I think what you see in the media consensus is a generation of journalists who are denied any access to any understanding of evolution or biology or animal behavior I what to journalists major in communications and journalism who is teaching them people who don't know anything about biology so they're getting indoctrinated into a certain view of the world that they think is natural that they think is the correct default way to understand everything and when they encounter someone who has not been socialized into the same beliefs they're kind of shocked yeah you know and the irony is what these people learn in communications and journalism is concepts like hegemony where like here's how you run a society you instill certain ideological beliefs and the elites and then those take over and those are the unquestioned wisdom and they're enacting exactly that theory of social control without even realizing that they're this sort of witless accomplices to that and how do you train your boyfriend easily know how do i train my boyfriend well but kind of how to turn your boyfriend idea is the idea that women actually have this faculty psychologically with figuring out what other people find reinforcing and punishing and doling out those rewards and punishments in a way that works in their own best self-interest both of women and with men and the idea there is that men have actually been less inclined to develop the sophisticated psychological means with which to control others and control their relationships because they had a simpler mechanism at their disposal which was basically physical force and so yeah my idea is essentially that women find this very easy to do to use rewards and punishments to control others but that they actually should be thinking more consciously about what they're trying to get out of their relationships with other people and if you're unwilling to admit to yourself that you're manipulative then you're going to meet even you're going to be manipulating others in ways that you don't want and towards ends that you don't want and even in ways that are kind of productive to good and healthy relationships and what do you think if what we're seeing at the moment in the culture looks a lot like a kind of dysfunctional relationship between men and women what does a healthy relationship look like I think a good healthy relationship not just romantic relationships but other kinds of relationships including between mothers and children and between friends is one where we can actually be skeptical about our own psychology so for me I sometimes have an instinct or a desire to punish somebody I will feel angry with somebody and I will try and figure out why from an evolutionary perspective what they did was abrasive to me and try and figure out actually what I want and whether I can get there through an argument or through being angry or through talking it out sometimes even talking things out is not going to be especially helpful and so in I think good romantic heterosexual relationships do involve some understanding about male and female evolved psychology so for example men and women tend to have different kinds of jealousy women are more emotionally jealous on average men are more sexually jealous on average and if I expected my partner to exhibit exactly the same kinds of stress and anxiety when it came to our relationship if I was saying why can't she be more like me and I thought that everything was socialized I actually would be trying to manipulate him much more to be like me and I would have a much more difficult time understanding where he was coming from than I do currently another thing is you know for example just speaking personally I've been in a long-distance relationship for some time and when we get back together it's always difficult because I don't understand that we had to be a part because our careers in different places I treat him as if he chose to be away from me and as if he abandoned me and then came back there's part of me that's treating him that way that wants to punish him even though he's just been reintroduced back into my life and so by thinking about parts of my mind as programs or thinking about actually myself as an animal that has trying to maximize for example the investment of my partner it actually helps me be skeptical of my own motivations and my own feelings in a way that you know I can be gentle with myself I understand where I'm coming from but I can also be skeptical of myself that I don't have to express everything that I feel because I know it doesn't always come from a place that's trying to maximize the benefit to the relationship and the stability of that relationship and we've talked a little bit about the when you could call that kind of ideological capture in the media and there are certain topics that we've seen with Jordan Peterson for example just even trying to talk about unique differences between men and women creates a huge backlash have a sense especially running a YouTube channel and being kind of increasingly exposed to the online world and what you might call the manosphere that that conversation seemed to go toxic very quickly what have you experienced much of it and why do you think it goes so toxic and what what what genuine in science do you think our being held in that kind of red pill manosphere culture yeah it's really sad because on the one hand you have this sort of a process of political correctness that says these topics are all out of bounds or at least you can't talk about them in certain ways okay so then young man go fuck you we're gonna talk about them anyway and we're gonna go and read it and over share everything about our lives and we are young and angry and pissed off and we don't trust the dominant culture and we don't trust what we're being told and we don't even trust scientists anymore because most of them have been captured ideologically so you get these kind of online gangs who think that like we are the righteous rebels who are like challenging the feminized culture and there's sort of 50 percent correct about that but then they're 50 percent delusional because they go down these weird rabbit holes where for example I'll often see in the manosphere explanations of sexual selection that I kind of recognized as like fourth hand echoes of my mating mind book from 20 years ago that's been sort of circuitous leary interpreted by various red pill guys and pickup artists and whatever and then if i wade into those debates and i say you know actually this comes from dissing this source and this is from darwin and this but this other thing is wrong then you get dog piles by these angry young men or like you don't know anything man you're like you're not in the master so it's a very weird moment what are the most dangerous are there any specifics that you can think about that they misinterpret and it it doesn't no good to do so I think there's a lot of sexual shame particularly around masturbation pornography you know there's the no-fat movement that says like young men should never masturbate that's like every juvenile male primate masturbates and how it's done for millions of years like teenagers masturbate 99% of male teenager like that's totally normal and if you deny that and you impose shame on young men for that you're totally playing into the hands of far left feminists who are basically taking male sexuality and saying this is entirely toxic and that the anti-porn movement like yeah you shouldn't watch porn like more than 20 hours a week that seems reasonable like that might interfere with your job but the idea that like it's more dangerous than crack or heroin and that it will create this like it'll drive you insane and it's incredibly habit-forming like the scientific research says no that's wrong that's not what happens but if you argue with these guys about that they are so invested in in not believing anything the mainstream science says and I totally understand why they're skeptical that they'll kind of jump at you and that's terrible because it means you they're not in a position to distinguish between what is actually evidence-based and real versus what pretends to be evidence-based and real but is actually ideologically captured and the the kind of stuff that you study and teach is right at the center of the culture war at the moment what do you have a sense of what a place of integration looks like is it kind of accepting that we have differences but also knowing that we can change them or that we have the ability to repurpose the hardware what's the what's the integration beyond the culture wall I think before we get to a point of integration there has to be a period of radical experiment it's 2019 nobody has any idea what the hell we're doing in terms of what a viable relationship will look like that could last until 2050 or 2070 or however long we'll live if we get regenerative medicine nobody has any idea we know lifelong monogamous marriage probably works okay for some people but not everybody right we know polyamory works for some people but not everybody we know whatever hot wifing and swinging works for some people but not everybody I think we need to just cut everybody a lot of slack and sort of say let's let's allow eat each of these little subcultures to flourish and each of them needs to be like radically honest about what are the pros and cons of what they're doing how generalizable is it to everybody else what can we what are the lessons learned from these different things and so I guess I'm quite humble about I don't know what's gonna work in the 21st century but nobody else does either and I think we just have to experiment we don't know how human nature is actually going to interact with social media and smartphones and contraception and modern education and modern careers and you know vast cities and all that stuff so I think everybody should be pretty cautious about like preaching to others like I love Jordan Peterson huge respect to him but I don't think he should be going around saying well we should all be monogamous geez just because it worked for a few thousand years well yeah it worked under conditions that are radically different from today some aspects that will still work some of it might not some of it might need minor tweaking some of it might need complete rethinking we actually don't really pay that much attention to other polyamorous people because we think that a lot of what other polyamorous people endorse is actively I actually don't understand how people do polyamory without an evolutionary perspective for example and that is something that we're planning on exploring more and writing and videos yeah [Music] you [Music]
