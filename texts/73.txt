you're a Zen master but you're also connected to the integral school ken wilber and this this idea of sort of developmental lens looking at culture and looking at consciousness through a very to the sense of where it's going and how it's developing so it's a very interesting mix of the sort of the timeless Zen and the developmental path of consciousness and we're gonna work I'm gonna open by asking you a little bit about Jordan Peterson at the risk of feeling that all over the content and all of our channel is about Jordan Pederson I think it's I think the reason for that is because I think it's a really interesting window into some of the deeper topics that I'm really hoping to to explore with you about masculine and feminine and where we are culturally because I think the phenomena of Jordan Pederson and the reaction to him for me at least there's something really archetypal about where we are in our culture and so I'd love to hear what you know just what you made of this this incredible kind of phenomena that's erupting over the last kind of year or so I was so excited to see Jordan Peterson erupted onto the stage and I know you had particularly part in that there is a culture war that is in bright precedence I mean we are in the middle of a culture war there's a polarization and Jordan Peterson is standing in the middle as a lightning rod taking all the projections from both sides he clearly sees the postmodern ideology and it is an ideology it's a system of beliefs and values that will not lead us to the promised land it is it is problematic it leads us into a swamp with no exit it is not sustainable he sees it very clearly and in my opinion he sees that from a modern perspective very brilliant modern perspective he's and he has a depth because of his understanding of Carl Jung and his own work in psychology the field of psychology that is deeper than most people so people are drawn to that depth he sees something much deeper then other people are seeing right now for me when I see him describing this ideology of postmodern a Galit Aryan relativism and describing it so precisely and then I listen to Ken Wilber describing the same disease there are some interesting differences between their two descriptions and there are even more interesting similarities Jordan Peterson has the depth of Jung's perspective and Ken has that too he studied Jung anointment but he has a much bigger philosophical view that is a little bit more evolved past into the integral Brown but the two perspectives are fascinating to me and both of them are critical the antidote the medicine for the the post modernity I believe Ken sees and I'm not sure Jordan Peterson does and Ken has a name for this he calls it a perspective on madness and it is madness there's no way out are the culture war in our our society Western postmodern society at war with modern beliefs and traditional beliefs is the psychosis so this a perspectival madness is kind of best summarized as this idea there is no truth and yet that is a truth that's part of it that's the Vanille ISM the the relativistic nil ISM which is saying there is no absolute truth and that's an absolute truth everything's relative and that's absolutely true that's crazy-making that's half of it the other half of it is rampant narcissism if there is no absolute if there is no power greater than my ego what am I going to worship as Ken points out there are studies that show that I'm a member of the Me Generation narcissistic sixties the people today the Millennials are two and a half times more narcissistic than the me generation that just breaks my heart open there's no way out of that no way out and when I work with the Millennials it breaks my heart I feel such compassion first of all everybody's lied to them everybody's told them what they believe is the truth and no one's told them the truth it's really interesting that you're that you're talking about compassion there because I'd say there's two there's two things firstly the difference I think with with Ken Wilbur's attitude towards what he calls the broken green and and that this maps on to what Jordan Peterson would describer sort of the postmodern neo-marxist worldview is the Ken seems to see it as a necessary stage of development and I get the sense with Jordan Peterson and he's so he rejects it so much that he he doesn't see it as a necessary stage at all he just sees it as a complete wrong turn in society but the other the other point is that you mentioned compassion for the people who are stuck in this this is where I have where I have a difficulty with with Jordan Peterson is that I don't feel that compassion for from him a lot of the time he attacks it so strongly that I don't feel whereas I would like what I would like to see a bit more from him as this sense of these people are have been misdirected they've been misguided and a sense of sort of almost like fatherly kind of concern for them as much as we need to eradicate this kind of worldview it's wrong it leads to the Gulag data which is interesting maybe that's the Zen compassion that you're bringing in if it is partially Zen but it's partially the second tier perspective it's partially what lies beyond green I'm not convinced that green is a bridge to the next level of consciousness it may be and just to interject here for our audience who may not know what green is what is is the level of consciousness that evolved or emerged more fully during the 60s and is characterized by relativism by post-modernism all these things it's actually bringing to the table some really critical ingredients whether Green is the end of an epoch or a bridge to the next epoch is not clear yet there are some developmental theorists that say Green is not really a stage of development at all it's a half stage it's not clear it's not like modernity post modernity is kind of confused and not really impossible to emerge as a full-blown stage of development because it's self contradictory because it's got inherent contradictions in it there's no way out of it it may be a dead end it may be the end of this epic rather than the beginning of the next one or the transition to the next but if it's the end that's a transition to isn't it it's not clear Robert Keegan is such a developmental theorists he doesn't see this postmodern as a stage of development he seems that more as a symptom it's just not clear yet we don't we won't know for a while we won't know till we're looking back from the other side so we'll see so I'm right in the middle between Wilber and Jordan Peterson hmm because I had read Carl Jung's collected works by the time I was 24 that the Union perspective was really important to me and then I stumbled into Zen nice done stumbled into Ken it's probably a really good time to just get a brief potted history of your of your background how did you how do you come to be a Zen master with the integral tradition I was raised Roman Catholic a German Roman Catholic in a small farming community in the mountains of Colorado I didn't fit in I had my first direct experience of God edie or emptiness very young and many more and when I went to talk about them I was beaten by the clergy the nuns they were particularly mean so I very quickly learned to not say anything but I wasn't very good at it so I kept saying things I kept conflicting so by the time I was 17 I was very rebellious and deeply disturbed I'm lucky to be alive I'm lucky to have survived such pent-up anger and frustration and in stubbornness so I met a woman a teacher one of my friends drugged me to meet this woman and I knocked on her door we had to be there at exactly 8 o'clock drove two hours to get there and this white-haired woman with fire in her eyes opened the door and she said welcome no one comes here by chance work guided by the unconscious because the unconscious knows so this was like putting it a key like Jordan Peterson talks about putting a key in a hidden lock and something opens I had felt this before when I was very young and I learned that trust in the Lord because the Lord knows it's the same walk different key but the same lock something opened then to all of a sudden this really confused seventeen year old of us not alone there was a whole group of of people that ste Chur introduced me to that I began to read with a voracious appetite Carl Jung Eric Newman Joseph Campbell DT Suzuki Krishnamurti mariachi Elliott a Herman HESA Watts a world opened and and I fell into it I started meditating about the same time and I there was a an image and a words that came out of nowhere as if from the top of the mountain I was worried about what am I gonna do when I grow up and all of a sudden these words boomed out of nowhere rather than finding your place in the world first find yourself and there will be your place Here I am a so-called master of Zen a lineage older and Rinzai Zen samurai Zen how perfect is this and I had read Jung's work by the time I was 24 I think like you thinks I see the same things you saw the movement of collective shadows what I see happening right now breaks my heart open hmm nobody else sees what I see Jordon Peterson smells it I suspect but I doesn't sound like he sees it what do you say I'd rather not say I have a sense that what we are seeing is the eruption of the shadow in a big cultural way and a lot of that is due to a lot of is facilitated by technology we have technology that suddenly so now not everything before was going through a few different channels the broadcaster's the the mainstream media and suddenly we've democratized the media we've democratized a lot of the information and so what I see happening is that we have all of these things that were kept out of the behind closed doors or were just we assumed we're not part of our society anymore now erupting out of the cracks between things beginning to you I agree I think this is just the beginning of we have no idea what's coming I think we maybe have a suspicion I don't think we do probably but but that's my sense and that's where I wonder whether what you're referring to is that same sense that we're gonna have to do some serious shadow work as a culture over the next to survive to survive yeah what you're pointing to and what you're seeing with technology in your position as being part of the media for the first time in human history I have access on my cell phone to the great works of the greatest thinkers and sages of all time right here Google what did aristotle say about this right here this has never happened before we have the ability to to look on YouTube for all these teachings and these teachers never happened before if we have no idea how this is gonna impact consciousness and the unconscious we just are in such a bold experiment and it's going to be amazing what happens and terrifying I suspect I can hardly wait to see what it is do you have an idea of time scales because things seem to be accelerating very quickly they are accelerating there is no time from an absolute perspective and from a relative perspective of course there's this construct applause a very persuasive illusion then it is a very persistent illusion so is the south most this ego is so persistent but it's not real as ramana maharshi said the only thing that's real is what is present and deep dreamless sleep everything else is an illusion and illusions can kill so can culture wars you you use the word culture war a couple of times now and I think this is very interesting because it seems quite clear that whatever was sparked in the 60s the culture war that kind of yes certainly was fueled by what happened in the 60s seems now to me to be getting bigger and bigger it's almost like a fractal pattern that was affecting a certain number of people in the 60s has just got bigger and bigger and bigger until it seems to be impact in the whole of culture now you were part of you're a little bit older than me what do you make of that do you think these are exactly the same dynamics and if so what lessons do you have from your experience for how we should deal with what's happening right now the image of a lake comes to me in fact it's a lake where I grew up and it was pristine water when I grew up and now with the global warming and with the amount of nitrates that are in the ground and have seeped into the groundwater the the whole lake has died with a green algae that has spread across the lake and killed all life the postmodern culture is spreading just like your fractals taking over from the modern culture but my view is of what happens if it's so dysfunctional that it kills the pristine lake it's not clear what's gonna happen yet I see the danger of that happening the medicine for the illnesses of the post-modern a Galit Aryan relativism which is the ideology that's prominent now in this postmodern culture two medicines one is shadow work two is understanding the evolution of consciousness because that is the next view that negates the blind spots of the pluralism you must see that pluralism is not the answer it's not the end it's not those who are pluralistic or enlightened that's just not true that's a lie it's just another step it's a bigger truth than modernity but it's not the truth the truth is the whole thing the whole so this is those two things shadow work and evolution you you mentioned shadow work and that was pretty much the main topic of my first interview with Jordan Pederson he was the first person I'd ever heard speak about it in a way that really resonated with me in the way because I I've done her personal growth work probably over 12 years or so and a lot of was was built around the shadow like integrating different parts of of ourselves and he was the first person I'd heard speak to that in such a compelling way and you you you just sort of hinted that this is the essential work I have the same the same feeling that the way through that sort of chaos of that I think's coming and I think we all recognize is coming has to involve us all doing that really essential in a work of shadow integration what does that look like and how how would you describe the importance of that for individuals and I guess a whole society that's a really big question and I trust each on stress it looks like being really fucking uncomfortable and it's forbidden to be uncomfortable and post modernity you have to be nice you can't give anybody any feedback you can't tell the truth you have to lie you have to avoid negative feelings at all costs those all kill any real shadow work you have to be willing not only to dive into the darkest darkness but be really uncomfortable and see all the hideous aspects of yourself that's the simple answer that also sounds very difficult to achieve in an English society you ought to try it the German society I was just in Germany or an American mush yeah but that that what I what I love about that and also the way you delivered it was that for me it's real spirituality yes anything else this whole love and light transcendence can I call it bullshit let's call it bullshit yeah let's call it bullshit is I it just it just really irritates me just this whole sort of sense of that spirituality is just here up rather than here down because all of the valuable work that I've done has been digging in the dirt really going into it and that people don't want to do is digging in the shit yeah not the dirt you got to go deeper of course people don't want to do it the the addiction and post modernity seems to be wanting to feel good you know you can't do the deeper work if you're limited to feeling good that there was a Buddhist teacher blame the baby boomers for that no we can't blame anybody we have to take responsibility blaming world health our part of the problem we must take responsibility so in post modernity I just did some beautiful work in a shadow webinar that I I just finished collective shadows most interesting subject part two of a three part series on shadows the the the rescuer the victim and the perpetrator this is an endless cycle in post modernity they are identified with the rescuer which is really deep down it's the savior the archetype of the savior now how deep are those roots in Christian soil the victim is the sacrificial lamb who must be sacrificed and stay sacrificed no redemption and the perpetrator becomes the scapegoat that in the Talmud the Old Testament was loaded up with the sins of the people and chased into the desert to die the scapegoat the one that carried the burdens which meant we had to we had to account for our sins on the Day of Atonement Yom Kippur my favorite holiday so we must add something to this trilogy to make it whole and complete and what we had and integrals in is the witness who sees everything the whole dynamics the rescuer keeps the victim stuck in perpetual victimhood unable to take responsibility and projects their own responsibility blames the scapegoat what happened in Germany was Hitler needed a scapegoat oh my what a perfect match what a playing out of these archetypal forces in the most hideous way this is just one example you know I don't blame the Germans because genocides have never ended there are genocides happening right now that are equally hideous and until we get in touch with the hideous beast that breathes in the shadowy depths of own haunted soul individually and stop blaming others for what is part of us they will continue and the weapons are getting much bigger and more deadly as Einstein said I don't know what weapons the third world war will be fought with who knows what they have in the in the warehouses he said I do know what weapons the fourth world war will be fought with sticks and stones so another lens that we've looked at or will use to look at a lot of the cultural and the social dynamics that are going on at the moment is is gender masculine and feminine and in some sense you can look at what's going on now is kind of this dysfunctional relationship between men and women that's now being that sort of on the biggest cultural stage and I have a just asked what you what you make of that do you think that that's quite a useful frame to look at the world absolutely it is a huge part of life masculine and feminine is everywhere you look if I look through a union lens then the Animus and the anima the relationship with the opposite sex parent is where your relationship with your soul begins it's who you will marry that's a continuation that vector continues and it becomes so important to understand and to get to the roots of that little child that inevitably gets wounded and masculine and feminine for me the the confusion I would sort of simplify as we've confused equality with equivalents so explain that for me please so we've confused equality with same yes that in our drive to equality to women being able to choose their destinies for probably the first time since the its in since the sixties and sharing spaces with men what I think we've confused is the complementarity of masculine and feminine and men and women with equality with a sameness an assumption of sameness and my sense from teaching men's work and and increasingly doing polarity work is that the way out is to really ground ourselves in our inner as men in our masculine to then be able to meet the in a feminine which we also have as men and the outer feminine as well and it's kind of it's it's the the paradox of the sacred marriage of masculine feminine but that can only happen if we really go into our own biological reality so I completely agree with what you see what you said and I want to add another confusing complication to that confusion that you articulated there are really two things going on that are merged together like trauma one is developmental we're moving from modernity to postmodernity to something that will work whatever it is post modernity is not working it's stuck it's not sustainable so that's one thing that's going on then we have this battle between masculine and feminine you know it's like an argument that needs to be a marriage a sacred marriage these two things are confusing enough in themselves but when we merge them into one mess and try to solve the one mess it's a far bigger problem than can be solved it's a wicked problem that no solution and we're stuck there so what you're pointing to is just half of it there's another half that is equally problematic and the combination and there's probably more confusion that I'm not seeing but this makes it unsolvable with this approach we must separate that differentiate these two things and and work on them independently and you've got one of them very clearly so let's talk about that one I understand as well that you were part of some of the early explorations of what you might call the the men's movement yes could you talk about that Oh be careful how much time do you have I was part of an organization called the mankind project something happened after I became very active in the mankind project I had to go attend to my mother who was ill and when I came back there was a complete transition this thing called multiculturalism had infiltrated the ranks and all of a sudden there were these these men teaching us that we were prejudiced and they neglected to mention the fact that they were prejudiced as well but we could smell it you know what they were prejudiced against prejudice everybody's with theirs and it stunk still does that's another one of the the performative contradictions of post modernity particularly the ideology of postmodern a Galit Arian pluralism they say one thing with their mouths and say another thing with their actions with their mouths are saying I'm not prejudiced with their actions are saying I'm prejudiced against prejudiced this is a problem this is a problem it has no integrity it doesn't speak the same truth there is a shadow here that's unspoken but felt this prejudice not a good thing to be protested against like it absolutely is of course but you need to own the fact that you're prejudiced and then it's not a problem if you pretend you're not prejudiced it stinks that's a performative contradiction you're lying if you say I and I am prejudiced against prejudiced aren't you of course who wouldn't be so telling that truth and not lying about it not pretending to be greater than somebody while pretending to be equal is where we need to go we need to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth we need the whole truth rather than just the perfect truth that will make us a beer to be enlightened and so-called equal perfectly equal is there such a thing as perfect equality I've never experienced it it's just an idea and when I try to teat treat people as though everybody's equal it's such a disservice cuz I can't I can't treat them for who they are I can't treat them with respect respect for who they are and all their their their individuality so this is a interesting it's a moral dilemma hmm and moral dilemmas lie at the core of culture wars this is something that Jordan Peterson says about you don't treat everyone with respect otherwise it devalues the currency there's something different treating people with common decency is one thing treating everyone you meet with respect is something different because respect is earned I have a little semantic difference in the way I would describe that I get the spirit of what he's saying and I agree with the spirit but I do go out of my way to respect everyone this is a mark of what I would call awakened mind respect for everyone the difference what must be earned is not respect it's trust this must be earned and we're saying the same thing different words and would you say that you're respecting the person as they appear you were respecting the person who they could become I look at you and I see Buddha see your arse eyes just Sparkle you just became Buddha this is awakened mind that light that just sparkled in your eyes is what I see when I look in your eyes I see all the shit - mm-hmm but that's what I respect is the Buddha or Christos same thing what is the medicine for an addiction like an addiction to ourselves like cultural narcissism when a a the founders of a a who were deeply influenced by Carl Jung Jung gave them a secret ingredient to combat addiction prior to a a alcoholism was incurable the greatest medical mind said there is no cure for alcoholism if you were an alcoholic you were written off no treatment possible what they got from um-- the part of a a Alcoholics Anonymous was a realignment was something some power that's greater than ourselves this is the medicine for narcissism this is a necessary ingredient if we can't awaken something more sacred than ourselves and the devotion do it we're not going to survive what I'm also sort of feeling from you as well it's something that I recognize in true spirituality which is this level of intensity it's I mean in a way that's what I understand even meditation it's like can you be here now can it be really really here and can you be really here with all of you right now that for me is the essence of all the spiritual work that I've done is can you access that level of intensity and that means accessing all of the parts of yourself the anger that yeah the everything at the same time the whole yeah enchilada yeah so there you go sparkling again mmm so I've got bad news for ya if you spot it you've got it you've got no choice but to become the Buddha that you already are don't matter what and you have that intensity never turn away those were things that happen oh there's much worse things tap there's fate much worse than death machine you are a Zen master and there are no masters as there there are no masters but I've always wanted to do this is that great that's the wrong answer if you flood the sparkle in your eye has already answered the correct answer for the coatt yeah don't confuse the audience this is one hand clapping this is one hand clapping what is not one hand clapping and can you see this deep truth in all things I've seen thank you very much absolute pleasure any time you
