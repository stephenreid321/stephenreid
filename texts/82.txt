welcome to the latest rebel wisdom podcast this is a slightly different concept so last week I interviewed Jordan Peterson again for the second time and I asked him a few questions about relationship with the left and he gave a few answers that I'd never heard before and we're gonna play some of that in this podcast and off the back of that we we've also just come back from America and we'd recorded this amazing discussion with some guys from the California Institute of integral studies on exactly the same topic what can the left learn from Jordan Peterson so we decided to bring out a whole do a few more interviews on the same subject and bring out about six or seven interviews at the same time so if you're watching this the link to all of those interviews should be below this in the show notes and we're gonna play some clips from those during this during this podcast because it feels to me like we're trying with rebel wisdom to really follow the cultural conversation really kind of identify where the cultural conversation is going and it seems to me that for quite a while on the left in particular they were kind of waiting for Jordan Peterson to go away like anyone who has that kind of exponential curve usually explodes and goes away he doesn't seem to be I actually asked him that question at the beginning of the interview and his theory is that this is actually a switch over from different forms of media from broadcast media where they get tired of you and they spit you out to online media where that narrative no longer holds which is interesting in itself and we'll put up that sometime soon I don't want to get dragged into politics too much we've basically done lots of stuff so far about different subjects spirituality psychedelics our sense is that by the idea of rebel wisdom is that what we're seeing is a is a change in paradigms a change in world views and we're sort of trying to kind of identify what that is so politics is just a subset of this kind of wider shift that we're seeing going on and I think for me it's really important we don't get dragged down into the political level too much but I think this is what's been coming up so far so we're doing one big foray into the political space as you're saying that it reminded me of something actually either Jesse or Matt said from CIA s the CIA s talk which will be released same time as this which was around it's much more interesting to talk about the underlying symptoms so the underlying structure than the symptoms and politics for me feels very much like a symptom of an underlying issue it's for me in many ways the least interesting thing to talk about not least because we know or have pretty good evidence to suggest that your own temperament you know how you balance the big five personality traits etc has a huge influence in your politics as as your personal history so so in a sense while it is important and interesting I think it's it's almost it's the tip of the iceberg and and I personally am also much more interested in the the rest of the iceberg another thing as well which is worth mentioning is that I think we both started talking maybe just quite recently a couple weeks ago about is there a shift happening within the left now there's a couple of things came out at the same time there was paper from a pretty well-known activist here not sure if you remember of each novel house I think that's it yeah mentioning how he'd been putting on conferences and and they had been taken over by the kind of what I would call this the social justice kind of identity politics fundamentalism and it had you know this is someone who genuinely cares about making systems change and he had started noticing what we're not getting anywhere it's just you know it's been taken over that was interesting and then Obama criticized the shortcomings of identity politics ABC put it out and there was a tweet that something about it's not who you are that should decide whether you get to speak yet precisely yeah and and he used a really nice example of when Nelson Mandela was in prison and what he didn't do was kind of polarize into one thing and get sucked into hate yeah and I think it's also worth mentioning the all of these words are kind of labels like we we talk a lot about integral theory for example the idea that even left and we're sort of in a position now where we're kind of going beyond left or right and I think that's very true and it's really important to to say that you can talk about the word left you can talk about the word liberal you can talk about the word progressive they tend there are personality types that underpin the sort of the idea of left and right sort of more one more open than closed one more ordered than the other I mean these these are do exist but there's always a sort of fluidity when we're talking about this so it's not that I think especially if you've been in this sort of space for a while you kind of maybe even flinch at the idea of people using the words left and right because you're kind of well whipped we're so beyond all of these labels and it's like well we are but they are actually pointing to real temperamental differences and there are habits of thought on what you might call the Left which are yeah which are are shared by most people who would who would share those kind of personality characteristics and share those kind of that kind of worldview so we can use the word meaningfully I think while holding it quite lightly at the same time so without further ado we're going to play the first clip of the interview Jordan Peterson Eric Weinstein describe sort of the cultural moment as a kind of civil war within the left i I'm I've got a lot of progressive friends and what I see happening recently maybe in the last couple of weeks is a lot of them starting to grapple with your ideas and looking at lasting this question what can the left learn from Jordan Peterson which is which is a pretty new development because I saw a lot of kind of reactivity to it before how can you personally contribute to that debate and absolutely no no doubt about it no doubt about it what one thing that I've been doing in my tour repeatedly when I talk about the first chapter of my book which is stand up straight with your shoulders back it's a discussion of hierarchies and their eternal nature right because my claim is is not my claim I think it's mere fact that organisms that have to cooperate and compete with other organisms of their type inevitably arrange themselves into hierarchies and that's been going on for so long which is at least 300 million years that our nervous systems have adapted to hierarchies as if they're a permanent element of being right more permanent than trees like seriously permanent at the most fundamental neurochemical the one that regulates the entire brain serotonin is acutely sensitive to hierarchical distinctions and so that's part of the proposition I laid that proposition forward was to say whatever pitfalls hierarchies might produce you cannot lay them at the feet of the West patriarchy or capitalism it's like that's a non-starter you're wrong and not just a little bit wrong you're so seriously wrong that if you insist upon doing that you won't even achieve your own aims because you're actually not grappling with the problem the problem is if hierarchies are a problem which they are the problem is way more serious than mere capitalism it's way deeper and if you're actually interested in rectifying the constantly the negative consequences of hierarchies then you're gonna have to get a lot more sophisticated than there then your idiot Marxism so so so part of the elaboration of that argument is well hierarchies are inevitable because we have to solve complex problems and we have to solve them socially and when you implement a solution to a complex problem socially you produce a hierarchy because some people are better at the implementation than others so there's a hierarchy of competence and then there's a hierarchy of distribution of the Spoils and so and in both of those hierarchies you get a disproportionate clumping of resources at the top and dispossession at the bottom it's in the nature of hierarchies so what's the left for the left is to remind those who are benefiting from hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost is the clumping of people at the bottom and that that's an eternal cost and it's not trivial and so that's what the left should be properly focused on the Left should be providing the voice of those who are dispossessed by hierarchies and the right should be saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are necessary and they're not only necessary but they're also productive then the left says yes but they tilt towards tyranny and they can be occupied inappropriately by people who are playing games of power fair enough the right has to take that into account the hierarchy can rigidity rigidify and is likely to do that and it can be taken over by people who are corrupt and that's likely to happen and so but but it's okay because the dialogue can work out the the right can say well yeah we need the damn hierarchies and they need to be but wrists and the left can say yes but they have to be maintained properly so they don't deteriorate and degenerate and and I think that's I think that's ancient wisdom I think the ancient Egyptians had figured that out in their symbolic representations so now when the left goes too far it does something like say well how about no hierarchies it's like no how about not wrong because all that happens if you flatten one of the things that happens if you flatten out the hierarchy is that you can't even organize your perceptions you can't perceive the world without looking at the world through a hierarchy of value and if because you can't perceive the world unless you make one thing more important than all the other things because you don't even know what to look at and if one thing isn't more important than all the other things then you have nothing to aim at if you have nothing to aim at then you have no meaning in your life so the left can't just demolish the hierarchies in the name of some equality of outcome let's say because you blow out the future you leave people aimless and you destroy the very institutions that allow people to make competent progress in the world that's not an acceptable outcome so we have to we have to agree to live with the ten necessity for hierarchies the proclivity for them to pathologize and the the necessary voice of the left and speaking for thee for the dispossessed so and I mean I've as far as I'm concerned I've said something approximating that through my entire career and so the fact that the left wingers have been irritated at me is well in some sense that's an inevitable consequence of me taking on the radical left wingers but it's also the refusal by the moderate left to deal with their internal problems yeah so the first question I asked was whether he actually wants to be part of that conversation like the conversation with the internal conversation which as Eric Weinstein said it feels like what's going on is a civil war within the left and it's sort of the mainstream left that's now become a cult that was the counterculture has now become the mainstream culture how does the Left draw boundaries because the left by by its nature does not like boundaries so the issue is how does the Left draw boundaries around internal boundaries that say well actually you're trying to hijack the conversation you have an ideological agenda or whatever it's like how can you have a generative dialogue when you can't build boundaries of people who are not willing to acknowledge the the things that are required to have a generative dialogue that for me is the sort of the best way of describing what's going on in the left and I have got the sense with Jordan Peterson part of this is kind of optics he's been on Fox News a lot and he he was also on I think rebel media very different formal wisdom and the sense that he because it's such a polarizing and volatile moment has been pulled on to one side of the culture wars but the right has embraced him the left has kind of rejected him so I think by definition he's seen on one side more than the other personally I don't actually think that he I don't think he's natural home is that and I think if people sort of were able to get past some of their reactivity to him they'd see that that's not his natural home yeah yeah I agree with that I think there's something around as you were saying that I was wondering like could he have been picked up by the more left-leaning ones and I think because of that ideological blindness in the culture within many parts of the left I think would have been so difficult for him for them to they couldn't they can't hold that complexity I think a few people have written articles recently about how the right was able to draw boundaries because of the horrors of World War two and the horrors of seeing really what happens when fascism you know it gets gets the interposition of power and there's a weird thing on the left you see it with Corbin you see it with a lot of the kind of old-school left and and you know this the young woman who was on Piers Morgan and said I'm literally a communist you know ash Sarkar I think that was just a few days ago and Douglas Murray wrote a really good piece actually in spectator around the insanity of that of like the right knows how bad it gets when the right goes extreme the left should know like and I mean it's clear it's in the history but we know was a even more recent and happen over and over again in many different countries and I think there's there's that element at play as well and Jordan P doesn't talks about that a lot you know he talks about that the horrors of collective and how the left how the sort of pathology on the left is not necessarily one single idea like on the right it's kind of racial superiority or right you're no longer in the conversation on the left it's sort of it it's a combination maybe three good values but I think the central one is that fairness is a good value but if you make fairness you're kind of primary axiom it ends up leading to madness and that's another Eric Weinstein quote he says that if you build a cosmology on a narrative of oppression it leads to madness because as jordan peterson said in the interview with me if depending on where you draw the line everyone is an oppressor and everyone is approached on some level the the interesting thing as well for me about the left of this sort of talk about the mask of compassion but just this assumption of moral good on the left and I think Peterson has been the victim of that this assumption that all all the moral value is on the left and on people who think in the same way as people on the left think and I'm struck by though there was one piece in one of his podcasts sorry one of his lectures where he describes helping one of his patients as a psychologist with he he got him a job in a charity folding letters in fact the guy found it really really difficult like it's really hard to do but the narrative that comes through is that he was with this guy for like 10 hours and supported him for many years and it's that's what I find really difficult when people it's clear that this is someone who cares deeply about people has been deeply involved in people's lives helping people so this assumption of the left of well he must be a monster or he must be a fraud all of this stuff is really it's difficult to take for anyone who's kind of delved into his lectures understands the kind of guy that is yeah not surprising for me having not really been on the left since I was maybe 18 and having been more on the kind of yeah certainly more towards the right maybe more an artistic and libertarian at different times but there is an assumption generally exactly what you said that all the moral virtues on the left which is not true when you actually engage with with thought that comes from the right especially if you think about so France Duvall Dutch biologist has done many experiments around empathy and animals in in mammals and pretty conclusively shown that fairness is something that's built into us we all have a sense of what's fair it's so deeply built in that if you get two dogs do the same trick and give one of them a treat and not the other one the other dog will stop doing that trick and capuchin monkeys men I mean it's deeply ingrained so to assume that one side of the political spectrum somehow has it and the other side don't have this biologically encoded sense of it is absurd because everyone cares about fairness on either side of political spectrum it's just that they have a different interpretation of what's fair and what isn't and this is a really good time to play a clip for the CI is debate Jessie Estrin who lovely guy who works in prisons like he's been deeply involved in social justice work for a lot of his life and yeah I'll play the clip now and you'll see you'll see what he says I've grown up and I've been really involved in social justice issues racial justice gender justice involved with philanthropy and activism on a lot of different levels actually and that's how I was raised so I've really been in this space my whole life and this is the first time I've actually been encountering are their viewpoints that would be either more Center more conservative and I'm actually really it's feeling really fruitful it's really refreshing it's really stimulating my thinking it's hard to see other people not join me in that and get kind of weirded out or freaked out by it which then makes me even more intrigued so yeah that's a clip from one of the pieces that we've just put live so it's a four-way debate that we had with Jesse Esther no Matthew Siegel after they so they come from a very sort of liberal left-leaning college called the California Institute of integral studies but were really and Gately put out this podcast where they started asking what the left could learn from Jordan Peterson and what the reactivity on the left to him said and I love the other things that we explore in there is why the quality of the rejection by the left is so extreme that there must be something else going on what Jesse says it's like a psychological complex almost it's - it's it's out of kilter with with what's actually going on and whenever something like that happened you have to kind of unpack it and try and understand why people are having such reactivity or such kind of strong responses to it yeah I thought that was a really enjoyed every moment of that conversation really smart embodied guys it goes that it's really good flow to the the whole time exploring the ideas with a mutual respect and yeah watch it it's good yeah so one of the things that we looked at and we thought okay so there is this there's definitely something happening where people on the Left are starting to ask what Jordan Peterson has to offer and one of those was at Ronin Harrington put out this film for his channel alter-ego saying comparing and contrasting Jordan Peterson and Russell Brand and in his sort of circles even kind of validating Jordan Peterson in st. well he might have something to offer provoked some kind of reaction in some of the people that watch the video but and we had a really great chat where he agrees with Jordan Peterson where he disagrees but I think his his central point about the criticism was really really good in a way the video was about Jordan Peterson's thinking but on a more meta level it was a commentary on a political culture so we face this enormous pressure to either love or hate either public figures or issues or to endorse them and to reject them and to be very public in that but people and issues are really complex and with someone like Jordan Peterson I can see lots of as I said in the video profound contributions and strengths and also areas for I feel like his thinking is really off and how can you hold that complexity in a tribal polarized culture where you're kind of shut down for holding it and I think that that maybe is the new political space that's opening up as more and more people willing to go like no I'm not going to just fall into a binary I'm gonna try and stay open and hold the complexity so I think his point that a lot of jordan peterson admirers like i really don't like the word fan cuz i think it's a terrible energy but a lot of jordan Peterson admirers are really put off by the tone of the criticism of him it's not that we don't like people Krita criticizing Jordan Peters and Jordans ideas even he himself welcomes and invites people to criticize his ideas but it's the tone that comes through a lot of the time in the media articles when you hear someone say he's a fraud or he's a charlatan or any of this stuff it's like he's clearly not a fraud or a charlatan so as soon as you start using that kind of language in a criticism it's very difficult to take that criticism seriously and also it's very there's a there's such a an arrogance in some of the critiques that is like I'm thinking one in particular is like okay you're a you're a you're a journalist in your late 20s you've done what exactly that gives you that the the knowledge the self-knowledge to be able to kind of pass judgment on someone who is is having whether you like him or not this incredible impact on on people's lives all around the world but what what is going on what is going on at a subconscious level mmm-hmm it reminds me of I mean there's a couple of answers that I've heard from a few people which is that it's like okay that they post an article it's like that's actually mischaracterizing his ideas here's the lectures where he talks about them and the response is often well I kinda have time to watch 20 hours of lectures and my response if if the journalist says that is like well then don't write about him you know it's I think that's I'm just thinking as well of the unrelated but slightly related the James d'amore memo that he got fired from Google for that was a similar thing where I don't think a lot of the journalists had actually read the memo so I remember I read the entire thing and then was like wow it's not well I've been trying to read articles and I'm trying to see where they had parsed these things together and it just didn't it didn't gel it's like I hadn't read it and I think there's that sense as well all like criticism is needed and so important that's how the conversation before but you can't criticize if you don't engage with the ideas like I don't I wouldn't criticize Freud because I know like a little bit about Freud don't know the body of his work and until I knew like a pretty decent amount I wouldn't go out there saying Freud is bunk so we also recorded a an interview with Tim lot who is a novelist and journalist who wrote the first Spectator article about John Peterson I think around the same time as I brought out my documentary really interesting guy who is described himself as an old lefty so he's kind of was a Guardian columnist and was yeah he talks about kind of the journey that he's gone on and also the the danger that he sees in this kind of new ideology that and the danger of that impacting art because effectively and he he puts this really brilliantly it's like anyone who says I know he's very suspicious on the idea that I know and the answer is diversity and equity and everything needs to be seen through this prism is ultimately a totalitarian mindset like there's not it's not that these values are wrong and this is where I keep coming back to like the sophistication and I genuinely would would like to hear Jordan Peterson making this point a little bit more carefully because when he when he starts railing against diversity and equity and all these things I can see the kind of react the reaction that it provokes whereas like as you said before fairness is a good value diversity is a good value if you can imagine like certainly police officers in their community should reflect their community will help them do their jobs better there are certain jobs certainly where diversity is a positive value but if you make that your primary axiom and assume that that's the only way to see the world and the only way to kind of organize your your your being in the world then it becomes extremely dangerous very quickly leads to madness we said before so we'll play a short clip from Tim finally and fundamentally it's the individual that matters and how could I think anything otherwise as a writer if any job is about the individual voice it's the job of the novelist you know you know films are collective projects writing a novel is the ultimate individual acts the ultimate individual voice and even that is coming under pressure now you know people they have they have I think they're called something like they're not called morality readers but their velocity reader diversity readers know how editors now who check you know that you don't have a uni appropriate you don't have any inappropriate opinions in your you know even for your characters that's a really deep sickness as well and that is that is totalitarian thought and it's totalitarian thought not in the government but it's a totalitarian thought mindset that I see on the March there are a few things in the interview with Jordan Peterson I never heard him say before and the sticking point that I hear a lot from my sort of more progressive friends is you all sort of primary focus is on the individual yeah well that's that's too bad for them because the primary focus should be on you know I can agree with that but what I the the paradox that they would say it's like okay focus on the individual but you have to accept that there are some situations that are much more conducive to an individual thriving than other situations so their focus is on structural inequality you're focusing on the individual is there not some interplay between oh definitely well obviously because people do have group identities the question is whether whether the group or the individual identity should be paramount and the left distance the radical leftist answer is well there is the look it's not me that's failing to take into account those two levels of analysis it's the bloody radical leftist because for them it's the collective and that's that and so it's obvious as far as I'm concerned that people have their individuality and then behind that they have their they have their group like multiple group identities which is also a big problem but all separately or any of these situations that make it much more difficult for people to self actualize well what I think they'd argue is they don't hear you talk about that very much well it isn't first of all it's not self-evident like I'm not I don't accept Maslow's hierarchy of needs I don't think it's necessarily more difficult for people who are poor to self-actualize sorry I don't buy that you because what that would mean think about what that would mean that would mean that the rich are morally superior that's what that means because they have all the opportunities to self actualize so obviously if the material conditions are the prerequisite for self-actualization then the rich are morally superior to the poor is that really an argument we want to make and then in fact I don't think that that's even even vaguely reasonable because one of the things that does help build character is privation now obviously starving to death is an an excess of privation so there are limit conditions but the it's a leftist trope that the provision of additional material resources will produce ethically superior human beings sorry not true and in fact sometimes quite the contrary so-so so I don't I don't I don't buy that argument in the least I also think that under most circumstances accepting those of exceptional privation and even perhaps under those conditions in most is in most cases your best bet to move people forward is to concentrate on the development of their individual character and their individual their individual moral character fine and because moral character is actually your moral character is actually the set of tools that you have to operate effectively in the world because otherwise morality would be of no utility and morality is in some sense precisely that way which is of maximal utility and so and and the other objection that I would throw it at the radical left is well how do you know that your your emphasis on collective existence isn't just an abdication of your personal responsibility well of course it's not it's like no no no seriously here it's not that easy to adopt personal responsibility maximal personal responsibility what makes you think you're not running away from it you have every reason to you really have that stellar moral character really that's that's your self analysis it's like sorry I don't buy it and I especially don't buy it when I look at the consequences of leftist revolutions because all these people of stellar moral character when they undertake their collectivist revolution nothing comes out of that but absolute bloody catastrophe so so all the well-meaning aims aside but he takes the sort of the individual being paramount and the collective being secondary which i think is is ultimately writing has no apology of that obviously but this sense that there are certain structural things that make it more more difficult to live a good life I mean that seems kind of undeniable that certain situations are more conducive to flourishing than others but then if you expand that to a sort of more developmental lens which says okay that the top of the pyramid is self-actualization the top of the pyramid is BA becoming truly ourselves and developing our cell and moral character and and becoming kind of fully embody human beings I asked him well surely there are situations where it's more easy to do that than others which is an argument I've heard lots of people make in this sort of more progressive circles that I'm familiar with and he pushed back on that in a way I'd never really heard before and that was to say that the idea of like Maslow's hierarchy of needs so you get the basic needs met at the top of the pyramid of self-actualization he doesn't like very much because implicit in that is the idea that rich people must be more moral than poor people and I'd never heard it framed that way that way and I think there's something in that I think there's something quite profound in that this equation of more material goods will produce ethically better people and that's such a how a strongly held thing on the left and it's such a key point to to kind of pull apart that sort of implicit I think it's not held explicitly I think it's held in place at me by a lot of people on the left yeah I think that was one of the key moments in that interview for me that that and also just never thought of it in those terms at all and it makes me think just if it makes me think of brexit as well it makes me think of a lot of the tensions that are in the society where there is this kind of assumed there is actually in many parts of especially the cosmopolitan city dwelling kind of liberal of which I'm probably one to be honest there is an assumption that all these idiots out in the countryside are just you know like Hitler really came from said deplorable z-- and you know what do they know they're all racist idiots there's a complete lack of respect and lack of attempt at any empathy and so there's a dissonance within the left around that that I really think needs to be I think I said this right after breakfast as well like I'm a Facebook post I was like we all who consider ourselves progressive need to be progressive and be empathetic and go and connect and really get to know I mean yeah that's that's absolutely key and it never really happened it hasn't maybe it will yeah yeah this is the I mean regular viewers might get bored with the number of times I say this but it's the shadow of liberalism it's this idea of this inclusivity that actually hides a tribalism and pretty much everyone on the other side of that debate recognizes it as a tribalism they feel excluded they feel rejected they feel judged by liberals for want of a better word and the idea this is why I think this is such a crucial conversation to be had about how does the left go about policing its boundaries and go about healing itself because the left is so dysfunctional right now and it's up in is so rejecting so clearly the people it claims to care about but the idea that it loves it loves the poor in in abstract but hates everything they believe hates patriotism hates all of the things that give people meaning and groundedness and all of this stuff and that's that to me is the most terrifying thing of what's happened since the election of Trump and since brexit is that a lot of the liberal classes that I know are doubling down on what I think caused that rejection in the first place saying oh my god it's worse than we thought there's so much more racist and bigoted and everything so much worse than we thought it's like well perhaps a little bit less of that rejection of all the people who voted for for Trump and brexit maybe a little bit of kind of self-reflection and understanding that okay Hillary Clinton and the left you managed to lose to Donald Trump yeah that's pretty bad yeah and that's what was really interesting about the debate with the guy that is they really were on board with that question they they kind of Matthew raised as a like we need to look at ourselves we managed to boost it on the Trump yeah yeah with absolutely just just finally in that point you know as as we're talking about I'm just thinking my own personal experience linked back to what Peterson says about moral virtue and it's absolutely true you know what I meet someone it's not their beliefs that rank them in in my mind of how good a person are they or how how trustworthy are they and how authentic are they it's it's empathy empathy is the it's also the driving force in a lot of it like this you know integral studies developmental models empathy is what's needed to be able to say yes and to transcend and include and empathy is what is lacking in a lot of spheres on the left not everywhere but in a lot of it like as you were saying and I think it's spread out fairly evenly just based purely in my own experience I think it's spread out fairly evenly through class and I think Peterson is probably right about that in the sense that masses hierarchy of needs is not the thing that gets you to that kind of self-actualization it's there's something else going on you know yeah and that as well I mean I grew up within a left very leftist household and I know this in myself up until kind of yeah a while after I left home this sense of like I know the leftist mindset really well we I don't know whether I'm on the left anymore so I might say we but on the Left people tend to judge each other by views like very willing to sort of I don't know if I can like this person because they think this or they think this well I know I'm not sure that the same thing happens quite as much on the right I think on the right people are far more willing to judge people by the contents of their character and by their their individual yeah by their moral character whereas on the left there are certain views that people are sort of testing out if you are accused of holding those then you'll be on the pale and that's and I see this also like even in friends that I did I have since we started putting out some content about Jordan Pederson there's a kind of well I'm not sure whether I whether I approve of not sure whether I like you anymore I'm not sure whether how to behave around you and that that really that's a that's a big thing on the left that I'm not sure is the same on the right yeah I think from on the right there is a great respect for individual sovereignty whereas the left has a great respect for collective fairness and obviously they overlap in some ways but that respect for individual sovereignty also I think has an impact on it's like well you think this but that's that's your business and I'll stay out of my way you said have you you know we'll help each other if we need to but you know and that there's just pitfalls to that as well but I think you're just thinking out loud I wonder if some of it comes from that the kind of focus on that on the individual you know talking about sort of where the left has got blind spots and where the right has got blind spots I think it's a good time to introduce the integral piece because we we've talked about integral theory quite a lot it's Ken Wilbur's spiral dynamics model and the idea of a developmental society that goes through certain define stages as they go towards sort of more integral integral itself is like post ideology it's a space of there's an ideology at each at each level and integral is able to kind of like it it's a flexibility of mind that's able to see where each of the the different stages get stuck and to move beyond it so you know one of the big conversations in the integral community has been whether Jordan like there's been this huge kind of difficulty of digesting Jordan Pederson in lots of the integral communities that I'm aware of is he an integral thinker is he not an integral thinker he seems to incorporate so much into his worldview but is he a genuinely integral thinker so we had a great conversation with Geoff salzman of the daily Evolver where we asked him to put him on the spot and said he's Jordan Peterson an integral thinker and that's what he said what do you say from your perspective he is an integral thinker yes I would he is able to definitely think integrally he has integral cognition as we would say his his heart in a way is in traditionalism in my opinion in a way that I think keeps him a little stuck there honestly but I don't care because what he's doing is he is helping this whole strata of people who have never had traditionalism well installed I think he's right I think for me Peterson is talking about the value of listening to people from different political backgrounds the value of exchanging ideas this is an integral viewpoint of being able to say well this is what this person's believe this is what they're supposed to believe this is why this is why but there's a he's able to sketch that out but I also agree that there's some probably some kind of reactivity in the way that he is towards the left that shows that he's not fully integral in the way that use in the world but then I think who is like I don't I don't know anyone who I would say is integral all the way down yeah and Matt if C is Matt Siegal made a really good point where he said we move between the different levels like not integral all day long you know he's like he can be to use a little bit of the integral jargon me be green and you can have a red reaction or amber kind of thing so it is a constantly flowing thing I think Saltzman put it really beautifully with that kind of modernist heart and integral head and there's nothing wrong with that as well like he says it doesn't matter so there is a place where I think that there's an implicit value in a lot of what Peterson is saying that I haven't really heard him make explicit before and this was my this is our final clip from the Jordan Peterson interview in a sense what he is arguing for is the reintegration of the sacred and that's what I really vote that's what I really value about what he's saying and so if that's the case and that materialism as a doctrine is a really it deadens the world seeing ourselves as merely material parts that are sort of we happen to be conscious but we don't understand why is is obviously deeply kind of opposed to the religious sense of no there's a deeper meaning we are here for a reason we are in some sense universe revealing itself to itself and all of this the different ways that we have understanding our plates and that somehow we are reflecting the universe in air in our being all of these deep theological ideas implicit in his arguments is the sense that this is a spiritual crisis this is you and we look at for example the opioid crisis in America and the dying off of the white working class in America to me this is the evidence of a real spiritual void this is a real sense of the the the negative effects of capitalism which can modify everything turn everything into a monetary value and most of the the people that I know or in more progressive circles are not materialist they're much more spiritually inspired and they're much more open to that it's a sort of Russell Brand's message of what we're seeing is actually a reflection of a deeper spiritual crisis I think that's absolutely true and I also think that it's implicit in a lot of what Jordan Peterson is saying but he doesn't make it explicit so much because I think he's also got a lot of it's also true when he defends the system that we have as the best system that we've ever created in terms of material wealth it's by far the best system we've ever created and if you start critiquing the system without saying and Wow look at look at the value in the technology and the way that more people than ever before have been lifted out of poverty and more people have access to clean water and more all of these things are true at the same time so I thought there is a way that he could reframe his message that I think would connect with a lot of the people who are currently rejecting it and this was the final clip we're gonna play my my sense of a lot of the progressive people that I know is that they're not they're sort of from a new generation they're not generally materialist that they're sort of very spiritually aware and I i sense a kind of implicit message in what you're saying that I'd never heard made explicitly that in some sense materialism is a deadening doctrine I mean you look at the opioid crisis and America you look at a lot of these if if poverty is seen as a more sort of also also as a sort of spiritual crisis or a spot that crisis of the soul as much as anything else it's mostly that like it's a real lovely thing if if poverty was caused by lack of money we could fix it really easily then but it isn't my point I think is to say that if if you were framing your message in that way I think there would be a lot of people on the left who'd be receptive to that message sort of that that actually there is a crisis of that the crisis of already call it like worldview has real consequences and a lot of the poverty we're seeing in the world is to do with this kind of materialist worldview that has become become corrupt or at least kind of stripped all of the meaning and purpose out of the world point well right well I mean I don't believe that material is a materialist hedonism is a sufficient solution now it's a bit more complicated than that because I do think that functional democratic systems are actually pretty good at reasonable hedonism like I'm pretty happy that our system produces a variety of toothpastes and a variety of toilet papers and a variety of sanitary napkins all of these things that that are basically oriented towards what would you call them individual creature comforts there's something about that that's really merciful and properly egalitarian and so a certain degree of material hedonism is a good thing right because it's nice that people can have their basic needs taken care of in a dignified manner but as a as a ultimate solution to the problems of life it's insufficient which is again why I don't really like Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs no it isn't it isn't a progression up the moral chain because of the provision of additional material resources doesn't work that way that doesn't mean that you don't want to you want to set up a situation where as many people as possible are absent the terrible structures of privation but we are doing that quite rapidly thank God so so I think we're the leftists are less happy with what I'm doing is the case that I'm making that the meaning that transcends mere materialism is to be found in the adoption of individual responsibilities because I wouldn't say that that's a core message certainly not of the radical left it's not that at all because generally they construe the individual as either the oppressor or the suffering oppressed but not as the active agent as either of those active agents the problem with the oppressor or oppressed narrative is even though there's an element of truth to it each of us can be subdivided into so many group identities that there's at least one dimension along which we're all oppressors and that's actually when I've been looking at what happened in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution that was the bloody error so to speak because you could take virtually any individual and you could find out it's like if there's one dimension of your identity that makes you an oppressor that trumps all the elements of your identity where you're a victim and the problem with that is there is one element of your identity where you're an oppressor and so that's sufficient justification to throw you in with the Predators and do whatever is necessary to dispense with you and that is exactly what happened in the aftermath well not only of the Russian Revolution but all of these radical leftist revolutions it's like well if you're a socialist while you're not sufficiently pure from a doctrinaire perspective and if you're a student well then you're part of the emerging burgeois class and if your parents were reasonably what would you say efficient farmers then you're part of the kulaks and like it just went on and on and on and on there wasn't anybody who escaped from the from being tarred with the brush of oppressor and that's because that is because each of us are in fact oppressors and oppressed every single person shares both of those things in common so the other question I aware of his blind spots so I spoke to Lena Anderson who's an author and also deeply involved in this question about what does a developmental you look like and she said something that I that I've we kind of touched on this in our podcast where we did a sort of constructive critique of Jordan Peterson which is is there a kind of theological incompleteness like he he's bringing back he's speaking to the sort of masculine power of the the culture and in a real way saying these there are these sort of very valuable hierarchies of competence there is a great story of responsibility going back generations her her thought was that he he stops with the kind of judeo-christian Abrahamic tradition and doesn't go further to the sort of the mother cults and the the sort of things that sustained us when we were in hunter-gatherer societies I've got it I've got some sympathy with with that and I'd love to ask him about it because this sense that and this is I think where his idea of archetypes as timeless things that's where I start to diverge I think because if they're not timeless if they've evolved then potentially what we are experiencing at the moment is a shift in these archetypal patterns because we're moving from the archetypal pattern of for example male and female roles based on the history of Agriculture the history of the value that males greater physical strength put on them as protectors and all of this to some to a time when that's the less important so is there is there an archetypal shift going on and before that there was hunter-gather Stone Age so join me Peterson completely misses the animism of the hunter-gatherers and the mother earth goddess of the early farmers yeah it's a good question I mean another way to look at that question is so he is talking about I agree with with that reading you know because especially with the very psychedelic background enquiring into the nature of like the Divine Feminine and what place I has in society in the history of it and you know how it's been present in many cultures like Minoan Crete etc I mean there's a whole huge topic that is I think that's a really core important point what Peterson is bringing to it so is this revival of you could say the revival of the divine masculine archetype in a lot of ways so the question is I think both need to be revived personally archetype early you need the divine masculine and you need the divine feminine because right now we we kind of you have the devouring mother and you have the kind of I mean a lot of not in their full power male archetypes as well so which has it's something like it has to happen at the same time he's bringing one piece of it but I think it's a fair critique to say to at least get them to contextualize that to say don't you know to inquire into that question or the archetypes changing does that need to doesn't need to be happen at the same time or for some reason that they need to be a revival of the divine masculine archetype and then the divine feminine archetype afterwards or whatever it might be open question I think it's a good one there so yeah this is a trial we've just overloaded people with content putting up six things at the same time seeing how it goes I mean it's the idea is to try and start a conversation the idea to try and build a community and the idea is to try and create a space where we can have these conversations in a way that they become generative they become open they become constructive rather than getting dragged into the polarization that we see in an awful lot of that especially in the social media space yeah yeah I think that's it's really key focus in rebel wisdom right now is how do we yeah have a two-way conversation a generative conversation where everyone's adding to it and we collectively all of us get to new places and you know explore new different thoughts there's only two of us there's 22,000 I think other people so we've created a discord so the link to the discord will be under the obviously the the conversations in the comments are really valuable as well it's just a discord discord is a chat program it's a kind of chat platform it's really easy to use if you click the link it'll take you through that kind of setting up an account and the reason we've done that taking it on to a different platform is so that we can have specific moderated conversations people who are really engaged can become moderators we can split out different types of chat there could be a general chat there can be a Jordan Peterson left chat whatever whatever it might be but I think it's it's important to have it somewhere outside in its own space so it can become a community its own right as well great and yeah get involved go onto the discord leave your comments and if you enjoy the content that we're putting out please do consider sponsoring us on patreon we'll also put the link below this in the show notes so thank you very much you
