[Music] so Lina thank you for joining me welcome pleasure so we're putting out a whole series of films this week on what Jordan Peterson's relationship to the left and Jordan Peterson's relationship to I mean the left is a quite broad term and for me it also covers most people on the more progressive end of the spectrum and I know that you've got a real interest in the developmental society although sort of shared interests on how we move towards a sort of more integration of left and right so I'm not sort of just begging you as someone on the left but you're you would you agree that you're more on the progressive end of society no I think I'm in the middle and I tried to make my spectrum as before and wide and deep and with as many aspirations as possible and I see a deep value in all the democratic fractions that have had so so I really try to see the full spectrum and I think that is that is the future what do you personally find valuable in Jordan Peterson I find it very valuable that he has given a more complex understanding of the conservative and the liberal even I think his liberal version should be divided and should be more nuanced and he has brought a lot of academic knowledge and history and theology and psychology into the public sphere and into our conversation in society and it has been almost impossible to bring these topics into the broader debate the broader conversation so I mean that's really great I did love it because it means that we can talk about some things now for which we did not share vocabulary before and that is really important and I also think and that is why I Illustrated it like this is that I mean if you up here I have absolute control and down here have absolute chaos order and Kay this is the axis that the journey Peterson is talking about I mean libertarianism with outing acceptance of all the other ideologies and of society will turn the world into chaos on the other hand if the Conservatives or the Socialists gain absolute control and order it will be to tell at Arianism all right I think that axis between order and chaos is really is really a good tool and that is inspired a lot hmm I was gonna ask how your perspective has it changed your perspective on the world in any way no and one of the reasons is that many of the things that you have a background in economy and theology I never completed in my theology studies so I know most of the mythology's that you talk that he talks about so so they're not new to me I see them perhaps in a slightly different light I also see some things that he that he is completely missing particularly when it comes to this whole thing about the patriarchy and the order in chaos and even parts of chaos and men know where the force of order I think both sexes both genders contribute with order and chaos I don't think he defined it as men and women being ordering chaos he'd say the masculine principle yes undifferentiated in some way does map onto Taoism and Buddhism when you see illustrations I mean there's the father standing for order and hero the son being the creative I think he calls it the creative hero who is the one who can transform the existing society into the next order of things that the next kind of society and a more complex society they are men and the force of chaos has portrayed us as the big mother so she's usually a woman so so there is but yes the masculine and the feminine but if you look at the and this is where I think he has this is really big blind spot which is that all in the history that he is describing and interpreting and bringing into order it's just the written history so it's the history and the mythology's of the Bronze Age Iron Age and modernity you can evil times and the Renaissance but but it's it's the written history and what's interesting about the written history from the dawn of picture racketing and particularly alphabet is that this coincides with bronze and iron it coincides with the axial age the big trade route between China and reason Italy so that axis geographical axis and the same planet so and the first really big empires but before that there was still managed active culture which had a mother goddess and that I was probably about fifteen thousand years of Stone Age agriculture maybe was just ten experts or debating right now and before that that was hunter-gather stone age so join me Peterson completely misses the animism of the hunter-gatherers and the mother earth goddess of the early farmers at least as far as will have come in his maps of meaning I'm still I still have like sixty pages left there may be stuff that he that he hasn't talked about yet but I got it so what the the mythology is that here analyzing and referring to are from the Bronze Age and Iron Age which is also the age of the patriarchy because when you live in an together group of maybe maximum two hundred people it's rather egalitarian you don't have to keep order it by using violence if you live in a village Stone Age agriculture maybe it's a thousand people so yeah I have to use a bit of violence to keep the unruly particularly young men common and make them behave but you don't have to build a hierarchy and so that is also the time span of the mother earth goddess and were the early farmers they were really I mean they how the you know the plants come up from the ground that's the mother earth giving birth so she was the organizing principle but then when you get into the Bronze Age and Iron Age and you have some of these cities 3,000 years ago with hello 100,000 people at least 10,000 people you get a different very different kind of power and that is also where male chauvinism begins you can read from the texts so so the epistemology the frame of reference within which during be Peterson is working is only part of our history and it's a part of our history where yes the men struggled to create order in these big societies and the way that they could do it was through religion through narrative through force through violence and the women became part of their property and so you also have the manly going out to war should have them traveling for trade so you had men who travel from city to city or from village to village and when you travel you have to be able to say I'm so-and-so coming from this place who are you ego sheet and that creates a consciousness and awareness that you don't get if you are just stuck on the home with the children and all the chicken and all the goats and you have you're not allowed to go out on your own because you're well man there's a risk of rape and there's a risk of attack sure there are all kinds of risks to women in these societies and so who ended up writing the mythology's well the man once you can see beyond that and see what came before that you get a much richer perspective on who we are as as a civilization and it's a complex thing but but he does defend Western culture does defend the hierarchies of competence so you know in a way he does defend the system that some people are calling a patriarchy hey my nice where I kind of align with what you're saying as well is that I do think that he that it's altogether possible that what we're experiencing now is a shift from a sort of male way of looking at the world to a way of looking at the world that incorporates the feminine and I think his his main focus is on reviving the reviving the masculine power of the culture and and actually I think that's necessary but it's potentially not sufficient and what we actually is a is a reinvigoration of the divine masculine if you want to see that but also for it to be match with the divine feminine we've created a society where physical strength is no longer the defining thing we would hope so potentially the potential for genuine equality and genuine both both men and women connecting with their more so intuitive direct ways of knowing if there's a potential for that it would seem so yeah I think that within within the within the known structures and epistemology of Western tradition Jordan B Peterson is doing a really good job and the irony is that in maps of meaning he says that if you insist on staying remaining with the old understanding of the world as the world changes then you are evil and what I don't see Jordan B Peters in doing is taking that step outside the known epistemology becoming a creative hero struggling with the big big horrible chaotic mother and then coming back and sharing with us what the next epistemology should look like what is the next mythology what is the next organization of society and exactly how do we get both the male and the female integral into a meaningful culture and meaningful civilization and we do have an enormous young man problem because everything that young men burger I mean everything that evolution made out of young men that which is let me say that which is unique to young and are things that we don't really need anymore you don't allow anybody to have any dangers and everything more and and in some respects thank God for that because it's a much more civilized peaceful society but it also means that there's this face where where young men are suffering and I think that Jordan P Peterson there's addressing that and that's a very very important group that we are not helping there's a lot of debate and especially in progressive circles as to where the Jordan Peterson is a positive or a negative net influence and a lot of people come down on the side that he's a negative influence what's your view oh no no I totally disagree Larry I think he's a very positive influence because he's voicing something that we have not been able to voice in very long time and that is important at most we must have that as part of who we are and he gives it you give to the very well founded and well researched voice I mean the post-modernism is a transition face you cannot build societies on post - why can't you build that society and post modernism well because post modernism is about deconstruction and you cannot build structures on deconstruction so there are really important insights from post modernism because there's a deconstruction and there's relativizing everything and the ability to switch perspectives and seeing seeing your own culture with the perspective of everybody else we just need to combine that with all the other phases that we've been going through when you need to combine this post-modernism with with modernity we need the signs of modernity and as peterson have pointed out which is really really crucial we need the narratives and the stories and the ethical moral struggles existential struggles of pre modernity of this whole face of written history because they were people just like us so there's a poetic world and a symbolic world that touches us in a different way and has things to say that science cannot say because it is not what science does what can guide us is wisdom and human experience and moral values and and bringing that back into the public debate is a really big contribution and then before the pre-modern or traditional written history iron and Bronze Age society there was all the Stone Age indigenous culture which has a spirituality and a sense of intimate connectedness that you can only happen if you're in small groups and then we have them Derna tea and science that both are really really crucial if we're to have democracy functioning States electricity we've had a bit of a technical problem with the connection here I mean we wouldn't even have had a connection if it hadn't been for modern science so so there are all these things that are equally important but in each their time each each they're placed
