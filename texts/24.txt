[Music] Jordan Peterson has become a global celebrity by weaving together mythology science philosophy and religion into a compelling theory of everything one of the most influential philosophers of the last decades did something similar Ken Wilber is the creator of integral theory another attempt to pull together much of the world's knowledge and spiritual traditions into a theory of everything integral theory gained a big following in the 90s and 2000's and remains influential after serious health problems over the last decade Ken Wilber is now returning to the conversation what do these two hugely influential thinkers have in common where do they disagree and what can they learn from each other a lot of times when it comes to Jordan Peterson it's not that I'll disagree with much of what he says I agree with much of what he says it's some of the things that he leaves out I find this a little bit interesting because he is clearly an integral thinker to get the most out of this film we'll need to introduce a little integral terminology at the core of integral theory is the idea that cultures and societies go through specific levels of development in the same way as individuals do becoming more sophisticated as they develop or grow up it's an idea that's common to developmental theorists including Peterson's favorite Jean Piaget you move from one knowledge structure to the next one which includes the previous one and is better and it's better because it covers more territory that's how you know it's better it does the same thing the old tool does plus some additional things so it's a definition of better integral theory represents this development as a spiral in this film will mostly be talking about amber tribalism ethnocentric authoritarian which first emerged about 5,000 years ago orange modern values the rational self emerged 300 years ago with the liberal democracies and the beginning of universal values Green the values of relativism multiple perspectives dialogue and consensus human rights sometimes called postmodern which emerged fully in the 1960s if they're healthfully integrated they support each other but each of them can believe that their way of looking at the world is the only true way and then they are mutually exclusive for Wilbur the incomprehension between these worldviews is what's causing many of the worst excesses of the culture wars above these levels Wilbur says is another level called integral or second-tier from this perspective it's clear that each of the previous ways of seeing the world has value and needs to be integrated this seems like a really good point to talk about Jordan Peterson yeah what do you think his success is due to as we started to get this both polarization and and then included regression in many cases these absolute istic retry belies points of view where people again if they were discussing their tribe they were saying this is what my tribe has in common with this tribe and this tribe and this service is this is how my types different from that tribe you need to serve some sort of special something or other and again there very well could be tribes that deserves special attention certainly but the point is if you're just emphasizing that and you're not emphasizing how that tribe is part of a unified overall tribal structure then that is just retry belies a ssin that is regression and the only ultimate end point of that really is just warfare and I'm he's just no way around it and humanity fought 300 thousand years to get over that stage so among other things it could bring in women's rights and bring in an industry and bring in the end of the intouchables and start including every minority you can think of LGBTQ transgender this was extraordinary but as I started to fall apart and get rocking went started to get left out as green became just extreme absolute istic and started devolving into neol ism and narcissism or even regressed to absolutist ethnocentric the only people you had supporting these original liberal values which are absolutely crucial to any higher stage the whole point about these stage is the development is that each higher stage again transcends but includes the previous stage and grand and transcendence include orange transcended and repressed orange that's definition of pathology that's when the real problems with that so if you have an integral thinker and they're looking out there to see what is really missing is that's what that's how and it's real thinker thinks is wait there's a little bit of truth in all of this however we including all of these things and you're thinking that way and you look out there and and if you are for example a professor teaching at the university one of the things you start to notice is this extraordinary lack of traditional liberal values those aren't protective those you get some lip service to them but again it's usually in terms of words like the quality and as we've seen there's two different definitions of equality there's orange their quality receives freedom and there's green equality which means equity equal outcome versus equal opportunity and so some of the right of course for supporting that and a lot of the people like Dave Rubin head had set of challenges I'm no longer leftist and what became real clear is that left and liberal were no longer the same the old original leftists were liberals but the new leftists were illiberal x' they're anti liberal and that's a disaster you can't go forward with that kind of pathology and so if you're somebody like Jordan Peterson who is thinking integrally and you're looking around and seeing what the hell is going on and you're starting to notice this and then the government comes along and says oh and by the way I'm going to compel your speech that would send anybody with integrity and integral thinking over the wall and so he was up you know all night he did those three videos you know forcing unconscious bias retraining and political correctness and what he saw happening with that and and the nightmare of Bill c16 threw him up on the net went viral and the main cause of that in my opinion is that is these orange liberal values of equal opportunity that we're getting crushed between the extreme far left of green and the strong far right of ethnocentric amber and these liberal values in between were just getting left out of the out of the picture and that was a disaster and that was the thing that at least put Jordan Peterson on the map and he was arguing against Bill c16 because not only that it put into law a constructivist view of human identity that was his complaint it had nothing to transgender people and the people that attacked him for being anti transgender had absolutely nothing to do with that he's very clear about that what it was was putting into actual law a constructivist view of human nature which by the way is pure green it's pure postmodern Green viewpoint and that also is an attack on free speech in the worst possible way what I found really fascinating about Jordan Peterson watching especially the maps of meaning series is that he is also attempting a real integral theory of everything what what was it and you're this this reminded me very much of your project how did how do you feel that his thought maps onto yours and what are the core differences there are a couple of different aspects of integral meta theory that could come to play in here and and I want to make it as non-academic as as as as possible one of the things that I have a really really deep appreciation of Jordan Peterson for is the process that I call showing has to do with what we call four quadrants and I can I can make that fairly simple by saying that the four quadrants for example will shake down into things like the good the true and the beautiful and people are fairly aware of that they're a very widely known widely accepted sort of Trinity of different types of knowledge different types of values different types of methods that we use and they each have a certain kind of truth but those whose differ point about Jordan Pederson is that he has an enormous amount of respect for objective science and he's always anchoring or at least correlating what he's saying with some sort of neuro physiological research or anthropological research or at big five factor analysis research or so on but what he realizes is that there are these other validity claims that aren't just objective material exterior truth and these other things are damned important as a matter of fact they are important and one of the disasters of the Western alignment was that it ended up going from an understanding where what it was emphasizing critic Charles Taylor the most dominant idea in the Western enlightenment was what the French philosophers called the system de la nature the great whole interlocking system as a whole John Locke actually called it the great interlocking order the second most common idea in the Western enlightenment according to author Lovejoy where's the great chain of being and we usually don't think of that with the rest of the Enlightenment but the great chain of being was a viewpoint of reality that as luxury demonstrates in his book called the great chain of being is the single most lively adopted overall philosophy that that the larger percentage of sensitive educated men and women have adopted throughout virtually all of our civilizations up to and including the Western enlightenment so when lesser enlightenment started doing when when the Keppler was measuring planetary motion and and Galilee was measuring earthly motion and Newton was measuring gravitation and laws of motion none of them were worried about being reductionist it because they all believed in the great interlocking order and they all believed in the great chain being so they weren't worried about anything happening to that but the problem is they were continuing to basically measure all of this stuff and you can't really measure these interior left hand subjective and inner subjective realities very well you can measure exterior matter well and through the more science kept going forward the more the Enlightenment ended up almost accidentally with an official philosophy of what's often called scientific materialism and so yes we believe in the whole interlocking order of nature but only as far as you can see it in an objective materialistic way it's very holistic and spheria interwoven this is all exterior objective truth so it has no interiors there's no beauty there's no morals there's no aesthetics there's no love there's none of that fits into a standard Systems Theory doesn't work so Peterson at the very least intuitively knows that those quadrants are real those dimensions are real and not only that they govern how we interpret the world around us and again that's one of the minor true but partial aspects that post-modernism came up with which is the world isn't just a perception it's a conception it's an interpretation we have to interpret these things that we see that's an important partial truth and nobody denies that including Peterson which is why the things he attacks in post-modernism are all the extremest regressive you know outrageously idiotic aspects of it but he still uses some of its core ideas because those are real in that there and he uses him and he knows it but he's looking at these interpretive schemes and he's really attempting to find out what those are and one of his closely allied issues to that was looking at totalitarian systems and saying why does that happen and became by his own account quite obsessed with that for decades and I very much enjoy his conclusions but so he has these notion of maps of meaning and then he would frequently start referring to those as archetype oh and and that's the way he for example would start interpreting religion and and he's given all these recent you know several hour-long talks about sort of every aspect of Genesis and he's just moving you know through the Bible and doing that and all of that is it's very important and I agree with a great deal of that that a lot of times when it comes to Jordan Peterson it's it's it's not that I'll disagree with much of what he says I agree with much of what he says it's some of the things that he leaves out and I find this a little bit interesting because he's clearly an integral thinker and let me let me give one more example of what second-tier means using a fairly well researched developmental model that was developed by Michael Commons and Richards and they just call it a hierarchical model but we really have to emphasize the understanding that there are two types of hierarchies and this is what Greene absolutely overlooks and it's a disaster there are Dominator hierarchies and there are growth hierarchies or actualization hierarchies Dominator hierarchies are all the horrible things that postmodern say they are they're tyrannical their power structures they're oppressive they're the cause of almost every nightmare you can think of in human history and you want to do as much as you can to get rid of those as much as you possibly can but then there are growth hierarchies those are the opposite of done literally the opposite of Dominator hierarchies in a dominate are those the same thing as what Peterson would describe as hierarchies of competence close to it the Dominator hierarchies the higher you go in a Dominator hierarchy the more people you can oppress the more people you can hurt the more exclusive you are the higher you go in a growth hierarchy the more inclusive you are you actually are including more people we saw this simple developmental model that goes from just me to a group to all groups to all humans to integrating all of those that's a growth hierarchy and the was so ironic and horrifying is that the postmodernist in their streamer collapse these and so they don't see that the values that they represent to the Sun they represent value so egalitarian values for example or values of identity or diversity you're not born with those values and out of those sort of six to eight stages of development there's only one stage that has those values and that's green but green is a result of about five stages of growth hierarchical development and when you pull the rug out from under all hierarchies you pull the rug out you pull a ladder out from getting to your own values a suicidal it's absolutely self-destructive and so in a sense you've almost given up on that and that's why they end up getting just very absolute istic and just sort of yelling slogans and regressing to ethnocentric and all that kind of stuff so these higher he's are clearly important and by the way just that whole notion of a growth hierarchy Peterson rather famously traced it back to lobsters and he was simply trying to demonstrate that the that some of these hierarchies are absolutely necessary we can't get around them and they're certainly not the product of Western capitalistic tyrannical patriarchy they backed like whatever's 350 million years or something like that to to the lobsters but in fact those kinds of growth hierarchies which are also author Kessler coined the term whole Larkin because each of its stages is a whole lung and a whole line is a whole that's part of a larger whole and almost everything in the in the universe is a colon and so even if you go back into a circuit the overall evolutionary sequence going all the way back to the Big Bang you're from atoms to molecules to cells to organisms to then even more complex differentiate involved organisms each one of those is getting more inclusive and they transcend and include literally molecules go beyond atoms but they enfold them they include them molecules don't hate atoms they don't oppress atoms they don't exclude atoms if anything they love them I mean they're actually hugging them that's what growth hierarchies do and if you're really serious about values of inclusion and diversity and comprehensiveness you need a growth hole are key you need a growth hierarchy and by the way the only people that use Dominator hierarchies are people at lower stages on growth hierarchies and everybody on a higher stage of growth hierarchy criticizes Dominator hierarchies that's how you get to do it and that's why the postmodernist were criticizing it it's because they were at this relatively high stage of development even as they started to go extreme and sort of mess it up so the one area where I would like to see Peterson give more attention is that is the actual amount of research we have on growth hierarchies in terms of some specific stages that they go through there's a certain reason that that those tended to drop out of academia and that is in the 1960s as we said in 1959 the percent of the population at green post modern multicultural green was about 3% and then it really started to explode during the 60s and if you were really smart leading-edge thinker at the time you were green you were thinking these signs of things you were reading Foucault and you were reading dairy talk and you were taking these things very seriously and they were emphasizing contextualism they were sizing constructivism they were emphasizing the interplay between perspectives that there aren't dominant perspectives you have to take them all into account there's all partial truths and all of that and the smart smart people were pushing those edges they managed to move into education and literally in a generation end up almost dominating it so we have essentially a green and often broken green a system of education that goes all the way down to first grade now so even in in like third and fourth grade kids will be given handouts on white supremacy and you know everybody who's white has to sort of see that and apologize for being and all that kind of stuff so they managed to take over education in terms of the number of professors that were conservative versus progressive and about 1950 the ratio from progressive to conservative was about four to one today according jonathan heights research it's about 20 to 1 as peterson will say there just are no conservatives and human sciences in a sense that's right and that's a real problem in terms of actually having a balanced overview of these things in the 60s as Green started to emerge and this is one of the reasons that we don't see much of a discussion about development in academia today as Green came in and started to take over evolution its major one of its major beliefs is it all hierarchies are bad because they've confused growth hierarchies and Dominator priorities and so during the 40s and 50s and some a bit earlier we had all of these really pioneering developmental psychologists that were studying these areas really for the first time and so if you look at all of the sort of dozen or so multiple intelligences and again if you don't like that concept and a Peterson doesn't like that you think about it is multiple areas of expertise or capacity so mathematics music cognitive development moral development emotional development eager development its values development and so on all of these pine developmentalists Canton to be focusing on just sort of one of these lines so PA tended to focus on cognitive development Kohlberg tended to focus on moral development Maseo tended to focus on motivational development jane Lovins you focus on ego development they didn't have a real good understanding of that at that time but the research they were doing was really good and the stages they came up with again showed both the differences that were actually there because they were each them looking at a different developmental line of development but the stages were essentially similar and you could map those across all of these lines but in the 60s as Green starts to emerge and come into the culture and particularly as it starts to take over academia what started to happen is that all systems that had anything to do with hierarchies were thrown out and developmental psychology itself was just devastated by that I mean there were entire departments of developmental psychology just closing down and so a lot of the really really great developmental is the really pioneering ones that we still look at today in a sense they all circled the wagons is the Harvard Graduate School of Education and so you know interestingly they weren't in the psychology department the psychology had already gotten rid of all those nasty hierarchies but in education you actually had to produce results you had to actually educate people so you actually had to know the stages they went through so all of these developmentalist SAR over in the Harvard Graduate School of Education I mean really the great ones um Lawrence Kohlberg was there Jane Levinger was there Fisher was there Howard Gardner was there Robert Keegan was there I mean it was outrageous and and they're still over there basically doing that and at interval Institute we sent a lot of students out to distending with them these are some really really great people people like Robert Keegan and so but the whole even topic of developmental studies was just immediately read as a wingman you're saying this person is better than this person and in Renault and that's not what they're saying I mean you mr. social activist you're saying it's better not to be prejudiced you're saying it's better to be to treat all people fairly regardless of race color sex or creed that's exactly what growth hierarchies are saying they said that those values are the result of several stages of growth you're not at six months old you're not born with those values and you're running around the little you know sign protesting but it just sort of fell out of academia discussion almost entirely and even smart people who know about the importance of hierarchies and the difference between competence hierarchies and inequality hierarchies it's just not a topic that tends to enter their awareness because mostly in any of the schooling they got it really wasn't a topic ever and services something is kind of dropped off the radar and it's one of the reasons that when we talk about an integral framework those are one of the areas that we include because there is an enormous amount of evidence for them and in particular they have such a strong explanatory power they help us understand what's happening and what and and the sort of summary of all of that is that as we look at the culture wars what we find just in terms of developmental studies is that it's in this this whole first tier set of stages the highest three the three that are most recently occurred and are still present everybody is born in square one and has to move through these so we still have a fair number of people at ethnocentric fair enough people at orange world centric and fair another number people at green multicultural but those upper three are at each other's throats they really don't like each other they've increasingly come to hate each other in many ways and they're at each other's throats and the problem is because their offers tear they can't solve that problem ever was by definition first here thinks that if dyes are the only correct ones but second tier that has the inherent capacity to see the importance of all of these and at least start thinking about ways okay since everybody has to go through all of these then an enlightened society would include ways to help us do that and so that's one of the things that is a way out of the culture wars in addition to whatever else we might need to do and there are plenty of other things but this is crucial because if we still have people that really are at values that are absolutely committed to not integrating everything then you're not going to get them integrated ever there's no motivation that wants to do that and so that's why a second tier integral orientation becomes so important and that's why people that are really looking to help draw together paradigms and cross paradigms to actually integrate then these number of different disciplines and approaches become so absolutely crucial there's a big debate in many integral communities about jordan peterson and one of the most frequently expressed perspectives is how can he be integral when he is so anti green if you look at just the actual developmental maps of what happens at these stages if you look at Commons and Richards for example or if you look at Kurt Fisher if you look at any of the stages that are trying to say specifically ok this is what happens in mathematical reasoning or in cognitive reasoning or in emotional awareness or in aesthetics or so on and they lay them out as I said one or several of the things that tend to get laid out at the meta systemic level one is that it's just that it's meta systemic it introduces the fourth person perspective it just means it can reflect on the universal third-person perspectives that orange brought into existence and that we're so profound for the Western world but that fourth person perspective is a capacity to actually reflect on that and make sort of certain critical announcements about it it can appreciate it or it can disagree with it but it can do that Peterson does that he's fully aware of doing that he's using that meta systemic capacity but he also has the capacity for paired ematic and and and cross pair demanded thinking so he doesn't just reflect on those things he tries to tie them together I mean he he'll say one of the things for example that Piaget was trying to do was to integrate science and religion and that's one of the things that he very much wants to do and so he does he is making use of those capacities although he's also transcended and included so he's using capacities that will encompass the limitations of having just that stage this is just that stage gets lost in radical Galit arianism and relativism and all of that it's not a really good stage to only have access to but he doesn't he has access to paradigm attic and cross very dramatic stuff in terms of anger this the fact that you're at an integral stage doesn't mean that first of all it doesn't mean that you have you can have no shadow elements you do you're just repressing elements from the integral stages and that certainly can happen and so and he no shadow material very well and he's made a enormous amount of giving an enormous amount of studying to it particularly in the line of young I said he knows his own shadow and and and I'm sure he's perfectly aware that he still has some of it I think that his anger is one that is in a sense a type of it's almost a kind of existential anger it's almost a kind of anger that looks at something that just from the most number of perspectives seems just patently wrong is patently mistaken now again I you know I think every discipline has some degree of truth because I don't think any disciplines capable just being 100% wrong there'd be no reason it would be adopted if it was just nothing but wrong every time he tried it you would give it up but they can do things that are so dysfunctional and they can be so broken and that's one of the things that's happened to leading-edge Green it is a fundamentally broken green and that's for example in I did this book on Trump in a post truth world and tried to indicate how that broken green was a large part of that political movement that we're seeing today and that's the problem with green it's not a healthy leading-edge and that's a real real problem because it is leading-edge what's starting to take over that leading edge is second tier because again we have about 5% 6% there when it gets closer to 10% then it's officially going to be a leading edge and there's going to be some sort of tipping point we're going to see that happening so in terms of any number of individuals in the dark web who again most of them I think are operating with integral cognitive capacities doesn't stop any of them from having very specific existential anger issues and things that they see and think that are wrong I think that if you sit down and actually look at the items that are included in each particular stage and see how those fundamental items are taken up and included in the next stage and then those are taken up and included in the next stage I think people could see how somebody like Jordan Peterson is making use of those fundamental intrinsic factors of that stage but a lot of people say he doesn't try and send don't include green you think he does I I think he does and I think the part of green that he doesn't like is the extremists identity politics neo-marxist aspects and my point is simply that if you look at virtually any developmental model of cognitive development you will see a stage of development that's variously recalled dialectical or relativistic or multicultural or whatever it is and it's just introducing a new perspective that can then reflect on the previous perspective and that perspective can reflect on the previous perspective and so on and those are real capacities real characteristics and those are included in almost every dark web intellectual that we have but then you're allowed to get angry with various aspects of any of these things and that anger might be what you could call just sort of a pure entirely justified anger or it could be some of your own shadow material nobody ever ultimately escapes all shadow material it's always there and I would develop a show if I have some shadow material it runs in the direction that you're in Petersons does which is I've sort of been riding in this general field now for maybe 50 years and so I just watched daily the postmodern theorists come in and initially they were making interesting points but then they got caught in relativism that started to generate into Neil ISM and narcissism and I just went off the deep end and we completely lost almost any of the value at that point and that was very disturbing and very angry making for me it really was in Fury you share his anger it's right you share his anger oh yeah very much and I see some of the positive factors that led it to become the postmodern movement I mean the whole point about there's traditionalism than there was modernism then there was post-modernism those are very real developmental unfoldings because that's the point that many people would say you and he differ is that he doesn't seem to see any positive value in post-modernism that's right and I believe it's because there's been this enormous downplay in academia of looking at almost any of the real developmental sequences so again if you look at Piaget and-and-and or even even call young I mean Peterson says that the single best book on Jungian psychology is it's Eric von neumann's I think origin history consciousness and I happen to agree I was absolutely blown away by that book I read it several times and even outlined it two or three times but the whole point about his book was these stages that consciousness went through any stage had a different cognitive capacity he stays saw the world completely differently there are different world views at all of these and that's was so profoundly stunning about the developmental of your point and it certainly too appears a but that never to Smashing with Jordan I've never heard him say oh and there's a worldview down here that looks like this and in the world here looks like this Peter said his stages even though he loves Pichet that aspect of developmental studies just got shoved off the burner and so if he were actually looking for example at the ingredients that each of these stages add I don't think he would disagree with any of those ingredients and given the fact that we have a fair amount of evidence that these things have to emerge in stages because the whole of one stage actually becomes an ingredient of the whole of the next stage so they are whole ons the whole of one stage is part of the next stage the whole of that stage is part of that stage so you can't actually get to a higher stage without including that lower stage and so what are we including well pre-operational you're including the passage for images and then concept symbols and in concepts and then rules and form operational matter rules and then systemic paradigms and in Kraus paradigms and these are first person second person third person fourth person fifth person perspectives all of those are added I don't think he disagrees of any of those and particularly if you actually looked at okay here's the skill that you add here here's the skill you had here and so on and it received these broad broad stages or that kind of development I don't think he'd have any trouble with that and if he did then I would just say well I agree with these hundred developmental maps that do you see evidence in those and I understand that you don't and that's fine but much more common nowadays are things like the big five factor analysis I totally agree with that it's part of what we call types actual ingredient or the internal framework we totally include that but again types you something that say essentially the same no matter what stage you're at you can start to shift a little bit but basically they stay the same that's what a type is and so and it also goes for example and if you even talk about types of male and female interaction or interest the traits those stay essentially similar as you grow and develop so you can look at all the things that all these stages have in common and that's fine they're real they're there but so are the stages I mean that's sort of the whole point because you have these dramatically different world views about how things look and act and what they mean and they're they're they're real and they're an enormous explanatory power so that's one of the areas that that we include in these 567 aspects of an integral in a remodel and you you just mentioned male and female and that's that's something that Peterson has been criticized for quite a lot he for equating the masculine with order and the feminine with chaos this is a theological point and maybe it's a simplified theological point what what do you make of that perspective it's not my favorite aspect of what he does I can agree with the importance of order and chaos and even to some extent the way he connects it with left and right brain hemisphere and that these are two of the very very fundamental dualisms that this manifested world is made of but but the direct connection of and he doesn't just identify he doesn't say the female is chaos and male disorder he says female is symbolic of it doesn't make it much better though that doesn't I don't find that a terribly compelling piece of information and and I find that it does that there are other ways to if you're going to try to describe just general statistical differences between men and women that one of them is symbolic of chaos and one of them is symbolic of order it's not one of the ones that we find very useful and I don't think a whole lot of either men or women directly connect with that I don't think they find that very meaningful he also of course will identify in general and that's that's one of the problems not many people understand statistics and so if you say 60 percent of the most aggressive people are men and 40 percent are women people will think you're saying you know that it's just either/or and that's just one of the problems is that people that aren't really sophisticated on these things are really misinterpreting what he's saying anyway I wanted to bring in something I've heard David data say before theologically you can identify the masculine principle with the witnessing consciousness and the feminine with the witnessed it does that help is that a mall is that a definition that might help expand this perspective well at this point what you are getting into is a lot of different types of systems that you know the fact that men and women have been on this planet for you know a couple million years there have been at least certain types of differences that we've noticed nothing else women give birth and lactate men on average have a slightly greater upper body strength so you can take a really brilliant feminist systems theorists like Janet chef is and she'll say that what we have to do in order to understand the differences in the different roles that men and women have had is that we do have to start with at least a few biological universals and then look at how those play themselves out in different techno-economic modes for example and that's an important type of addition it's part of what we call showing up in integral because we're looking at all four quadrants and the techno-economic mode is the lower right quadrant if you're looking at a society from an exterior objective fashion and the men the stages that are often used there for example are Gerhard Lenski who came up with the stages of foraging or hunting and gathering and then horticultural agrarian industrial and informational and janice athis took just those two biological differences ensured how they produce dramatically different roles for men and women at these different techno-economic modes one of the reasons you have to take quadrants into account when you make these kinds of statements so even given those differences that are pretty hard to deny at least in terms of biological where we say upper right exterior of an individual viewpoint and foraging sexuals were just barely being differentiated anyway but the men tended to do those items that required upper body strength so they tended to do hunting and would tend to be more warriors and then women tended to give birth and lactate and they just sort of played played that out when you get to horticultural you start to see a real shift where the cultural is the first form of farming and it's defined as farming that just uses a simple digging stick or hoe and the important thing about that is a pregnant woman can do that kind of farming without any real harm to her and chef has estimates that in horticultural societies about 80% of the fruit stuff were produced by women and so they clearly are having an enormous impact in the public productive sphere they're not just in the private reproductive sphere and as a matter of fact in horticultural societies one study showed that approximately one third of horticultural societies had female only deities and these are all the great mothers societies and when these matriarchy societies were first discovered under the patio erekle society here's a massive discovery is like wow and of course the feminists jumped all over is like you know women were first and then men took it away and all adapt it was a huge discovery and it was discovering just this horticultural base and the way that took differences in human biology but still played them out very differently in terms of roles men were still kind of trying to go off into hunting and stuff but women were producing 80% of the food because that was coming from farming and so they had a role in the public productive sphere and again about a third of those of those deities are female only and that's almost the only place you find that whenever you find a great mother society it tends to be quite a cultural well then agrarian came into being that was farming done with an extremely heavy animal-drawn plow now greatest chef is women that did that suffered an extremely high rate of miscarriage and it was to their Darwinian advantage not to do that plus the just the heaviness of the damn thing tended to select for men in their upper body strength and so there was a big change and one of the things that we find there were other causes but looking at this omelet this is an almost Marxist orientation but the deities and agrarian cultures are oat 95% are male only and if you want to start talking about something like a patriarchy that's where you could really start to point at that and say that's really patriarchal Chavez's point is that but you can't just say it's oppression women were choosing not to do that and there are actually some studies of those kinds of patriarchal cultures history quality of life was much less for men than it was for women nevertheless women did tend to then be in the private reproductive sphere men in the public productive sphere and that tended to start to get that kind of patriarchal orientation again you had to be very careful about saying that was just men oppressing women that's something that really drives Peterson crazy and I share some of that because takes away the agency of women and and I found that one of the most disturbing factors of the feminists theories that tried to do that and try to blame all female conditions to oppression because it takes away their agency as if they actually had nothing to say or do about these societies but as they really were contributing in at least some important ways to how these were done I don't know what women there's feminists know that think that women were just acquiesce like sheep to everything that the man did to control them but these aren't the women I know I died there I don't know where they're finding these women but apparently that happened then when you start to get to industrial cultures now you start to get a real shift because now machines are doing the work on nature that human bodies used to have to do and that takes that pressure out so now there's no longer as strong a selection for male body upper strength and female birth and lactation and so here we start to see again universal modes of morality we start to see the rise of the women's movement we start to see the freeing of slaves and abolition and all of this is going against the traditional roles that were laid down during agrarian which is men do all the public making decisions women's stay home and run the household in the family and those were rules that both of them were stuck with it's not like one of those was a whole lot of fun and the other was miserable I mean men died a year sooner they had to fight in war that virtually all of the death inducing jobs they had the state could force them to give their lives weren't feral call them the disposable sexes I mean just it wasn't that the they just had it all bad but they didn't have it all good it wasn't like they arranged the society that gave them the best of everything and women the worst of everything because if they did that they did a shitty job so I just think that can't be an idealistic version for men it can't be so then as we move into informational then there's even less drive for physical force and what we're facing now is this possibility that men and women just have different interests and now they're more free to express them and so Peterson's point about that is that in countries like Scandinavia where you have the most freedom for men and women they actually show the greatest differences in terms of preferences and so what's that all about well it's not just oppression it could be some but the oppression also remember is basically modernity gets blamed for all of these horrifying rules but modernity was halfway through the Cure they were starting to get rid of these agrarian roles which were very patriarchal again not necessarily just the oppression but just through the differentiation of what the sessions did and the absolute brutality of nature and what we had to do just to stay alive and that didn't include men having councils all the time trying to figure out how to oppress women it was mostly men and women thinking together what are we going to do to manage to stay alive and yes there was oppression and that was during an ethnocentric era so of course there was racism and slavery and one tribe against other tribes and all of that those roles are what the modern rational industrial societies started to overcome and then they become even more so in information and what we're trying to do now is because we have this leading-edge green which is bro again mostly not allowing us to even discuss these issues because everything simply has to be equal outcome and if it's not there's discrimination there's sexism there's racism there's something going on and again the difficulties that it's not that those aren't occurring it's just those are only occurring there are other reasons that it's occurring and those aren't necessarily bad those have to be allowed or else are going to start erasing those as well and you're going to end up doing what you did with hierarchies you're going to try to get rid of all the Dominator hierarchies and you're gonna get rid of all the growth hierarchies and then you can have to get no way to even grow to the values that you're trying to get established you've lost the path to it so all you can do is protest and yell and scream and doesn't do any good at all so there's a theological point like a lot of people are critical of Jordan Peterson because on some level he's doing a really important role of restoring the role of the father in some sense but there is a sense that he's looking back to like he's trying to restore Christian values and very masculine religious values could it be that actually we're seeing a theological shift so the kind of theology that we're moving into is more of a balance between masculine and feminine because as you've said that the role of of men and women is changing so actually what we don't we don't necessarily need a restoration of the sort of God the Father maybe what we need is a different theological synthesis well I think that's part of the difficulties that come and they they come in part because we leave out that developmental component so we were talking a bit earlier about just the sort of Janet chef has few which which I find there there's some genuine truth to that as part of a overall integral framework but you can see how there were shifts from more mature focal societies to more Patra focal societies and then two societies start to try to overcome those and those new stages of development certainly industrialization and information to the extent that those had in effect on our culture and they did they're not something you found in the Bible there's not something you found in early civilization now Jordan my sake yeah but we had the seeds for all that there and go right but notice that still took a while to unfold and many of those early stages didn't have that and many of these existential or even transcendental important Givens that were being embedded in religion those also tended to unfold even though we can find in the judeo-christian tradition this tendency that would eventually lead to individual rights even if it wasn't that often expressed in a full extent in the original orientation and particularly since most of the world's great religions did arise during appearance like the great axial period roughly a millennia or so BCE those really were the error GE Epps's error of just the modern mythic era and and for a lot of the religions created at that time there were again these two different aspects there was a very small number they were involved in waking up actually having this transformative Satori experience of altering the unity consciousness but most of them were just okay what do I have to do to stay on the good side of this god what do I have to do here or here's history of my people or something like that when it says Moses parted the Red Sea when that was first written when the person sat down and wrote Moses parted the Red Sea they didn't have some deep symbolic meaning to that it didn't mean oh the Israelites had to overcome a lot of problems and we look to our leader Moses and he could he could help do away with with blockades like moving a Red Sea and that was all symbolic and then we moved out and found our own promise that's not what the person meant when they wrote Moses parted the Red Sea they meant this guy named Moses stood next to the Red Sea and he went back and the sea parted and they walked across that's what he meant and so again when James Fowler was actually measuring these developmental stages of religious belief systems and again like most about mental models he found six to eight major stages of development and they were versions of archaic to magic to mythic rational pluralistic and integral most of these weren't he actually called mythic literal because the myths were meant literally and so you'll notice when Peterson tells us the meaning of Genesis or the meaning of exes or those kinds of things he doesn't agree with the literal meaning and the literal meaning is what the original writers meant that's what they were saying but he's trying to read something deeper into that and that might be there and in to some extent of course it is simply because societies have not only their explicit conscious understandings for those sorts of infrastructure interactions and mechanical systems that are occurring that we know nothing about or don't really understand so all that's fine and we do have this whole left hand first and second person implicit rules and patterns of behavior that we're really not that much aware of so he it's okay for him looking for those but one of the reasons I hate he won't himself just say yeah I believe that he doesn't believe Moses really parted the Red Sea not literally so that's not what he's talking about and and this is a little bit where the problem comes in because if you're going to do that and you're going to look for these underlying rules and patterns really best evidence is that those unfold those develop those have changed we don't look at human sacrifice the way we did 4,000 years ago there are different implicit rules for that we did do that it archaic to magic periods but then we crew out of those and there are different grammars different rules at each of these stages and the same goes for how men and women have interacted even if we agree with let's say a big five statistical analysis that men have more industriousness and women have more agreeableness and negative emotions say okay that's fine but just as we saw with you Janet chef is analysis of the male and female roles at different tech North anomic eras even though it's the same biology there can be these differences in terms of what's masculine and what's feminine and so if we want to choose some of those things that have some sort of truth today and then we're going to track them all the way back you know to three thousand years ago we have to be very careful about how we do that and one of the things that I think will help Peterson's explanation of religion if he does look at these different stages of religion the actual beliefs as they unfolded and not simply sort of put them all together as a single narrative and then try to read the existential underlying rules for all of them that's that that's a little bit dicey if you really are looking at different ways that human beings develop through their spiritual understandings and again I'll just mention James Fowler very quickly he was one of the pioneers that was looking at these different capacities that humans have in this case he looked at something that we recall spiritual intelligence so like cognitive intelligence emotional intelligence moral intelligence there's a spiritual intelligence that's different from direct spiritual experience direct spiritual experience that's waking up again we can talk a little bit about that because Petersen is perfectly aware of waking up and he absolutely aware of it but he doesn't really talk about that so he talks about more than growing up components and how that happened but he doesn't take a look at some of these different stages like capsules archaic magic mythic into rational with the Western culture and then into the multicultural pluralistic post-modernism valor found that and he defined God the way Tillich did as concern as an ultimate concern so whatever your ultimate concern is if you make a list of the most important of the most important of the most important things in your life whatever the top of that list is is your ultimate important thing that's your God what ever it is it could be atheism and you're still using spiritual intelligence because whenever you think about ultimate realities that's what you're engaged and that's the intelligence that you activate when you think like that and the faller found that it really did go through these distinct identifiable stages and then we can combine that with people attend historical work like jean gebser you see some real similarities and in those things and they are profoundly different I mean you really can have a spiritual worldview that's magic voodoo tends to be an example of magic magic is the idea and it tends to occur and developmental sequences fairly early because the human organism is learning to differentiate itself from the environment and in the process was learning to do that it hasn't quite succeeded and so it's mental image of a thing isn't really real differentiated from the thing so it thinks that to manipulate its mental idea of the thing is to actually magically change the thing so if I make a doll that represents you and I stick a pin in the doll I've actually hurt you that's magic and we all have magic we love superstition but that tends to be when the earliest stages of cognitive development where the earliest stages of spiritual intelligence and so on and it is magic as it starts to move towards mythic you get a stage that Spile dynamics for example calls power gods because you realize there's still magic or you think there's still magic in the world but it's you don't have it anymore you keep trying it really doesn't work so you sort of give up but others have it so mommy for example could change the yucky spinach into candy if she wanted because she's a power God and so if you want to be on the good side of your power God you have to know how to be nice to it you have to know what it wants to say and develop these whole rituals or types of prayers and so on and eventually that magic retreat Senta just supernatural beings series sir Apollo Yahweh God that kind of thing and then you get the magic stage and that occurs on up until you get the emergence of rational which has the third-person perspective reflects on that goes those are really real if I want something I'm gonna have to do it myself through scientific experiment and and research so so you're seeing those kinds of development occur in religion and and what Peterson does is he won't himself profess belief in any of what those stages actually say and he said he doesn't really believe that Moses actually parted the Red Sea he doesn't really believe that Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt but that's what the people that had that belief that's what they believed now how much they are also being influenced by these hidden factors that he sees what was really happening that's a little bit more open to debate I think they are there but I think you do you see shifts as development undergoes because they just aren't the same fundamental rules at those different kinds of viewpoints and you had to take those into account and so that's one of the concerns with that now his argument Sam Harris is Harris focus is exactly on what they're saying and that's what he says and that's wrong and so he'll actually criticize Moses really parting the Red Sea and he'll say that's just false we don't need it get rid of it and then Peterson is again and Sam is doing it because he he's not an eliminative materialism but he does still tend to kind of reduce everything to third person determined causality and there's no room for freedom in and in that at all and so he'll he'll take all of those actual literal statements of religion leading up to science and you'll say all of that is just flat-out bloody wrong it has no business being there it was a stupid mistake we made from the beginning it's still around we've got to get rid of it nothing good and he's altering from that third-person deterministic scientific stance and Peterson is always going to know wait a minute there are these interior left-hand subjective and inner subjective realities and yeah okay it's not actually Moses parting the Red Sea but it is these really existential means that help us develop value systems in the first place including a value for third person science that you just don't get that out of midair that comes from this implicit belief system that you can see in these religions but this is where they really are at cross-purposes because they're not really arguing the same thing at all and both of them are leaving out these developmental stages so what Sam really doesn't like is magic and mythic viewers of ultimate concern he doesn't like them in Islam he doesn't like them in Christianity he doesn't like them wherever he sees them and at the time that they existed it was in a sense the best we could do but today yes you can do better in terms of the types of truth that might be attempting attempting to be disclosed there you can do better in many cases using a type of scientific third-person approach but there still are all these interiors and they still have various rules and patterns to govern them and you can't get those just through an objective view of science and that's where Sam is always holding out the last thing I want to say just very quickly is that both of them are fully aware of waking up and neither of them include that in their argument and it's weird because the actual super core of a spiritual system is the system of waking up it's not developing a series of beliefs that okay I believe Moses really did that and yes I believe Christ really was born from a biological version and if I agree to everything it says in the apostle creed which is a list of myths and I believe everything says in the Nicene Creed another list of myths and I signed on the bottom line that's it I'm a Christian I'm saved forever in a mythic world view and then so on that's not what ultimate spirituality is about even the Christian mystics would do more like what st. Paul said let this consciousness be in you which was in Christ Jesus that we all may be one that's a fairly good description of ultimate unity consciousness that's what around the world there are various daily sub branches of religion that know about this and it's called enlightenment awakening Sanskrit is moksha pure freedom its Satori it's the great liberation [Music] you
