[Music] this time on the show I'm joined by David fuller David fuller is the co-founder of rebel was a media company that if you're familiar with emerge I'm sure you've seen some of their content they interview people like Jordan Greenhalgh Jamie wheel Jordan Peterson all of the people that have factored in to the conversations that we've been having on the podcast and have been playing such an important role in our culture right now is the various sense-making institutions as Jordan greenhalgh would say began to deteriorate and so David is joining me for a kind of conversation about rebel wisdom has just passed fifty thousand subscribers congratulations David you know about what inspired him to begin this project why he thinks it's hit such a nerve with people what they're all subscribing and where this conversation you know sometimes associated with the intellectual dark web is going and why it's so important so David welcome to emerge Thank You Daniel looking forward to it yeah and so to get it started you know it's I know from personal experience it's it's one thing to be on the interviewee or interviewer side of the equation it's another thing to be interviewed and so I find myself curious um what for you was the inspiration to move out of your work with the BBC and in media and create what is a pretty radical departure this whole rebel wisdom media project what was behind that for you yeah I have to say I prefer asking the questions rather than answering them but yeah it's been very spontaneous for quite a long time when I was working I work for Channel four News for many years I left to do documentaries for Channel four and for the BBC channel for news for people who aren't sort of familiar with the UK is is generally regard that is probably one of the two most high-quality news programs and I was working for the foreign unit so I was in Libya during the the fall of Gaddafi I was in Tahrir Square when Mubarak resigned which was an amazing opportunity and something that I'll never forget like I was really at the center of some fairly amazing moments but at the same time when I look back there was something that was kind of missing in terms of my feeling of where I was meant to be and what I was meant to be doing and I think that goes back to I studied philosophy and I'd always been doing a lot of personal growth work and been very interested in spirituality and very interested in what you might call the kind of paradigm shift and feeling very keenly that there is the need for this paradigm shift especially out of out of sort of the naive materialism of the culture that we're in at the moment and realizing that that kind of perspective was not very easy to bring into the mainstream media yeah most of the gatekeepers in the mainstream media are sort of under the sway of the sort of very Dawkins aiight scientific realism so those kind of programs that looked at kind of the reality of spiritual experience or religion or the sort of the full 360-degree picture of what it means to be human we're not being commissioned and also I just had this sense that yeah there was there were perspectives that were not being brought forward into the media I didn't really know what to do about that at the time and I don't think the technolog technology existed to be able to do anything about it at the time either and it sort of been this technological revolution and then rebel wisdom happened very spontaneous you could even say synchronistically because I saw Jordan Peterson emerge probably about 18 months ago and my immediate reaction I dive I'd go very deeply into the Bible lectures I was immediately struck by here was someone talking about young it was someone talking about the deep mythopoetic structure of the world and I was completely gripped by the message and I just had this very strong sense this is exactly what our culture is missing right now this is effectively what we've forgotten and he and so I I went to go over to Toronto actually to a Bible lecture I thought well some people pay I know a few hundred pounds to go and see their favorite sports team and might as well go and see him give a lecture it wasn't until I'd actually booked to go for the Bible lecture I thought well I am a journalist I could ask him in for an interview and so I did and he granted me an interview the day after the lecture which I was very pleased by and then we did the interview and it wasn't until I'd actually done the interview that I thought well no one's actually made a documentary about him yet this was October 2017 I think yeah and this is well before most people had ever heard of him as well you know so I then thought okay I'm gonna turn it into a documentary which I did over the next couple of months and that became truth in the time of chaos the first documentary and I still think I still think it's worth people maybe going back and having a look at the interview that I did with him in in October 2017 because there's a real I asked him a lot about young a lot about the integration of the shadow that's when things start to line up yeah and the more you're in that space the more they line up and so the question is if you're like really in that space how much do things line up I've had experiences where everything came together you know and and and there are very very powerful experiences and they're they're also characterized by it's like everything turns into a musical symphony where each part is exactly appropriate for that moment and and I think music actually expresses that which is partly why music produces transcendent experiences you know I think it is an intimation of Paradise it's something like that and you can think about that psychologically you know because it also makes sense psychologically that your optimal experiences are going to occur when you're most United with yourself and but I don't know what see we don't exactly understand the relationship between our consciousness and the world we're at our best when we're integrated completely and there is an effect of that integration in principle on what we would normally regard as external reality because external reality can line up with that integration as well and so-called external reality you know I also think that figures like the Buddha you know he's an exemplar of the possibilities of that alignment and the exercises the yogic exercises for example our attempts to bring that alignment into being you know I mean it's very centered on the body which is quite interesting even though it's a spiritual tradition right it's very very centered on the body and I think people probably experience that when they have peak sexual experiences with someone you know where there's real intimacy because they're in the same place at the same time and everything comes together for that moment you know maybe literally yes yes literally right and and and I also don't think that that linguistic usage is chance right because I think that's a place where that experience is a brief intimation of of heaven that might be a way of thinking about it I've really not seen him ask those kind of questions many times since a lot of people have really focused on the politics have focused on the gender stuff and it's I think it's really missing the point to look at Peterson through a political and gender politics lens I mean it's a valid they're valid questions to ask for sure and he's definitely a controversial figure and there's a lot to unpack in his worldview but to have someone arguing for the reality of spiritual experience the reality of something like psychedelics to bring about that spiritual experience the reality of a deep mythopoetic layer that we need to connect to and seeing him arguing that on the on the kind of world stage is still astonishing an academic who's who's quoting young despite the fact he was told from the beginning of an academic career don't mention your on your torpedo your career if you do it's a it's an astonishing thing that we should not forget I think despite what's happened since terms though I mean there's so many different kind of tangents we could go down already I'm sure but I just wanted to complete the the the the answer of where rebel wisdom came from because it then I then turned it into this documentary and then a few days after I released that documentary he then had that famous encounter with Kathy Newman on Channel four News where I had been working only a few weeks before I was still freelancing there even though I'd left there and so and considering most of my interview with Jordan Peterson was about synchronicity and was about these kind of meaningful coincidences and how do we make sense of them and what how do we follow the thread of these synchronicities that was an extraordinary thing chronicity and at first what I tried to do was to liaison the scenes cuz it was almost like seeing your parents fighting or something it was Channel 4 News had one perspective and they were very upset because Kathy was getting a lot of abuse online Jordan cleared her son was very upset because he felt that he was being framed as the villain and and he hadn't done anything wrong and I thought and he wanted another interview with Kathy and I try to liaise between them that didn't get anywhere Jordan was happy to do it Kathy and Channel 4 News were just just wanted it to go away by that point and so that process of what am I supposed to do with this strange coincidence turned into the film glitch in the matrix which I pretty much came through and in a real sort of flow state over about two weeks in January 2018 and it included awful lot of things that had been I've been thinking about since the Trump election so Jordan green Hall I got in touch with and did an interview with him and he's a big voice in the film Ken will was Trump in a post truth world was not actually named in there but it was a real underpinning of a lot of the a lot of the arguments in it and actually when I spoke to Jeff Souls Minh of the daily of all that he said that documentary was a pure integral download which was very pleased with because it was very informed by the shadow of liberalism what is it what is the liberal overreach that we're seeing at the moment that's provoking Trump provoking brexit provoking this kind of rejection of what everyone up until 2016 thought was a kind of liberal an ever more liberal society and what it what is it that liberal liberals need to own about their own shadow their own kind of tribalism that pretends that it's not a tribalism to for the conversation to move forward and so glitch in the matrix then Jordan Peterson watched it loved it and put it on his channel and that has that's been by far the most viewed piece it's been viewed over a million times on Jordans channel and hers is still the piece that people kind of get in touch the most about and one little kind of big head of plug I've sort of been tracking it since Jordan put it onto his channel it's now I think either the fifth or the sixth most viewed piece on his own channel on his channel on his channel which is pretty amazing considering it only went up about a year ago and some of the stuff there has been up there for four years yeah so so that's the long and the short of it there were these two films that emerge very spontaneously and then the the channel emerged off the back of that and I clearly kind of leveraged my experience with channel 4 and the BBC into getting the interview Jordan Peterson there's clearly a kind of sealing that's the way you can get with a podcast or a channel until you've got a couple of big names on it and then you can use that as your reputation to get more people on and I was with that with with my background and with the access to Jordan Peterson to be able to to kind of springboard onto some other big names yeah well and that's I mean what I'm really struck by in in the story you just shared and also just in watching this unfold in real time because I remember you know when you release these documentaries I recall when Jordan Peterson really just sort of exploded onto the scene and that it felt like he was kind of breaking some sort of conversational seal that then many other actors came in behind him right he was kind of this this first mover who then opened up this whole new territory that I now associate rebel wisdom very much with convening people in right and it's this I guess you know you've used this term and you've explored this term through a rebel ystem of the intellectual dark web is it was a Brett Weinstein or Eric that they coined up Eric Eric Weinstein coin in this term the intellectual dark web and so you've done I think a lot of mmm careful study of that term and what what what what what exactly it is that people are describing when they they use that phrase what what's your perspective on it now is somebody who I think is more and more responsible for for it you know you're kind of hosting these conversations that people are increasingly identifying with the intellectual dark web so what's what's going on there that's a really good question because we have the the phenomenon that has now got the name the intellectual dark web and then we have the intellectual dark web itself which is if you look at the New York Times article the Barry Weiss wrote I think in summer 2018 probably the names in that are the names of the people who are officially in the intellectual dark web there I know Barry Barry Weiss was talking quite a lot to the members of it into Eric who came up with the term and also the origin of that of what has now kind of surfaced as the intellectual dark web as this kind of space for conversation we released a film glitching the matrix to actually a couple of weeks ago which was a long Illustrated interview with Eric talking about where the term came from and where why it's necessary given the structures that he's seen being erected since the 1980s in inside institutional frameworks and how institutional frameworks have steadily more and more been keeping out the heterodox voices hmm and how we've replaced genuine genius and without genius with excellence effectively then as structures develop what they reward is people who go along with an already existing status quo excellent people who play by the rules rather than people who challenge the paradigms that those organizations are based on and if you continue to do that what you end up with is very fragile institutions especially once those institutions are under more and more pressure and there are more destabilizing forces as there are in the culture right now and I think that's really worth I really urge anyone to go and watch that documentary and maybe a player clip from it now I would say that everybody in the IDW is fairly disagreeable in the sense of the Big Five personality inventory so can you hold a position when you're the only person in a room that believes that thing if it's you versus a hundred people I would say almost everybody in the core of the IDW is capable of holding a position where everyone is against you and I think that that trait is extremely rare do you see the IDW is primarily school project no I don't I see it primarily as a precursor to anything decent its what has to succeed for us to have a political conversation I don't think we're having a political conversation it's this kind of loosely affiliated network of people and who's quote-unquote in or out of the IDW you know there doesn't seem to be any kind of boundary there but it does seem to be performing a purpose which is presencing all of these heterodox as you say ideas into the discourse and my I have a feeling like there is some kind of emerging worldview being articulated not by any single individual but through the collective conversation like the Gestalt of the conversation as it happens across many different mediums and so I think the nature of the IDW makes it so that people like yourself you know curators the people who are having that like hosting the conversations are in a kind of unique position because unlike the people you're talking to you're not as much locked into a particular perspective and so I one of the things I'm most curious about is you know what's your sense of this emerging worldview like what what what what what are the bounder contours of it what's what are what's being articulated not buying a single individual by the kind of collective I think like I said before it's really interesting to look at what is the emerging what is the emerging phenomenon that is outside the IDW itself because if you say who is in the IDW at the moment I think that's a very it's very difficult to know I think it is pretty much whoever Eric Weinstein says is in the IDW right and yet there is an emerging consensus that is certainly applying to more than just the IDW I mean you can look at the success of something like Willett online magazine Claire layman started in in Australia I think in 2015 and it's just gone from strength to strength over the last year especially and that's that's a really good that's a really good place to look I think and and Colette pretty much is filling the void that Colette is filling it's kind of known as the in-house online magazine for the IDW and if you look at the void that it's filling it's the it's the interaction between academia and the media and there are things that are well known and established in academia for example the innate differences between men and women that are not acknowledged in the media and a lot of what has happened is there's a worldview that's hardened into an ideology in the media that is not really supported by the academic research it's become more and more it's what Jordan greenhalgh describes as the blue church yes the blue church has mistaken the values of openness for an ideology of openness hmm and that's a really I thought that's a really great way of phrasing it what we started with coming through in the 60s was a worldview that valued genuine openness and inclusivity and diversity and all of these very valuable essential values especially if we're talking from a kind of we looked at it through this kind of Wilbur spiral dynamics lens we could say it's a green world view but that world view has become increasingly an ideology and there are certain views that you must have in certain music you must not have within that ideology and it's become increasingly policed by Twitter more than anything it seems so there are certain things that you can say and certain things you can't say one one good example if you're looking for a kind of overall frame is the Google memo was a really interesting moment in in culture yeah and collect one of their big breakthrough articles was for academics respond the Google memo and it went viral because they were able to because Claire Mae layman was an academic herself so she was able to know exactly who the right people were to go to to say okay look at the Google memo that James d'amour put together which was characterized in the media as an anti diversity screed they literally more than an anti diversity screed and there's even people I was asking the Atlantic by Konnor Frias Dorf I think he said he's never seen a document that was publicly available to so many journalists be mischaracterized by so many journalists hmm and so there was a real failure along the by the by the mainstream media around the Google memo and then so it had all of these graphs it had all of these kind of and he explicitly framed it as if we want to increase diversity in tech we're being told that the only reason for the lack of diversity is discrimination there could be other reasons and he even put forward some suggestions which are if men are unbalanced more interested in things and women are more interested in people maybe we should introduce more working together in teams he actually put forward some some suggestions of what to do about it but then the Colet so cool that were then able to to get for academics to respond to him pretty much say he got most of the science right um he then there may be things that he over overplayed but he got most of the science right and for him to affect he been sacked for that certainly through a chill put a chill in to just about everyone working in tech it made it absolutely clear to everyone where the boundaries were and that where the boundaries well how far they could go and that was a that was a hugely significant significant cultural moment moment where the media failed and qualit was able to to fill a gap and I think passing that for me I think is where the that that's where most of the the emerging view is it's it's actually restoring the value of academic truth and you can't really do that without pointing to their hat an ideology has emerged that is trying to shut down a lot of debates and you can't really get away from that and I'd like to play a piece actually from from Brett Weinstein now where he talks about that so we are all watching something move across the landscape and alter what can be said where it can be said at what kinds of language have to be used and many people will tell you nobody really believes that and then others will tell you oh it's a tiny number of people so it's you're blowing the danger out of proportion but those of us who are paying attention to it are watching the institution after institution be lobotomised by these arguments that really don't rise to the level of a good discussion and a college dorm these are not high quality arguments they are not robust in the face of what is understood as a result of decades or in some cases centuries of study and different disciplines so how is it that these wrong arguments carry so much power that's the question the answer in general is that game theory provides loopholes where people can have power that is disproportionate to their numbers and disproportionate to the power of the logic underlying what they are saying so the wielding of stigma in such a way that causes people to be much more likely to voice one perspective than the counter perspective understanding the the biases that exist as a result of a sometimes cynical use of game theory him and his wife Heather Heying were the most high-profile victims of campus activism in newer in the u.s. in Evergreen college they they were effectively they ended up being run out of the college by a mob who are accusing them of being racists and I think anyone who looks into it would would pretty quickly see that that was not that they certainly were not racist though there are very progressive people who were on the receiving end of an ideology mm-hmm and that that's that's why this is such a difficult conversation to unpack because all of these are very good values and something's very easy but any value taken to an extreme if it becomes your kind of guiding axiom can turn into madness and as Eric Weinstein another member of the IDW said on the dave rubin show with brett weinstein you you cannot build a cosmology on oppression it leads to insanity and now i think is yeah if we're kind of naming what the the IDW is it's a it's a space where we can have conversations without being accused of certain things that will generally shut that conversation down right right and it also seems like broadly speaking people within the IDW and this i mean you're right like the IDW if it's just people that brett Weinstein says are in it like that's not as interesting as I think this kind of emerging conversational space is quite a bit bigger that's enabled by new technologies right and and that is playing host to conversations that are not based in ideology or at least are attempting to do something other than merely kind of ideological possession and then speech acts you know and and two of the two kind of battle in in the dark and nothing actually happens and and you know III appreciate the way Jordan Greenhalgh is is articulating a move towards a kind of generative non-ideological coherence building conversation that takes place between and among sovereign individuals which in my mind as a kind of naive optimist is where I hope the IDW and this this kind of emerging conversational space is headed and I guess I'm curious for you as another person who's convening these conversations and talking to people is like where do you see this headed what's what's what's your sense of what the future might bring for this this whole phenomenon this whole network yeah there's a really great question because it really fits so I think pretty much everyone who's been following the emergence of Jordan Peterson the emergence of the IDW and this sense there is a teleology to this conversation there is a direction to this conversation and it's very much one that's I've been very aware in with rebel wisdom and it's something that we're hoping to get more and more in a position to to influence as well and you mentioned Jordan Greenville Jordan green Hall is one of the certainly one of the most fascinating and important thinkers that we found since we've been starting to follow this thread and it it is leading in that direction and it's something that like we said before there's the IDW then there's the emerging conversation it's under the underneath it and I think that I would love to see that kind of that grouping extender to include people like Jordan green Hall include people like Jamie Weil who I think is is holding a really vital piece Jamie wheal wrote stealing fire and is a flow state's experts what I thought what I find with Jordan Greenhalgh and with Jamie wheel is there they're both bringing this deep felt sense of the liminal yeah and and that's something that can't be faked I'll add Daniel Shmack Tim burger into that as well it's really deep felt sense of speaking from a liminal space and how do we collectively go into that liminal space where the right answers will emerge regulars without that I don't think we're going to get through and I think that's the crucial that's the crucial thing that we need to do is to learn to get into this into subjective sense making and what prevents you getting into it is thinking that you already know the answers yes and so it's a so what we're looking at then one of the embodied practices that are able to put us into a state of sovereignty into a state of allowing ourselves to be wrong allowing ourselves to give up and this is again going back to Jordan Peters and I think it says that beautifully about allowing the deadwood to be burnt off hmm there's something really vital about how do we genuinely get into this space of intersubjective sense-making and and how do we do that collectively I know that's that's really the focus of jordan green halls work and it's something that we it's definitely something that we are attempting to do with rebel wisdom it's the next it's the next stage of the project so we already have a an event coming up in in May called the summit where we we already we have Jordan green Hall Brett Weinstein Heather hi Andy and McGilchrist who are tremendous thinkers in themselves hopefully demonstrating on stage entering into thinking in public demonstrating this kind of inter subjective process themselves and then we're also we have a hundred and fifty guests and we're going to break them into small groups and and hopefully facilitate them to get into that space themselves as well that's fantastic and I don't know how how directed are you being in terms of like is there a goal for harnessing that collective intelligence that I imagine the 150 people that make their way to your event will be pretty interesting people capable hopefully of doing this kind of work you know yes what's the what what do you are you attempting to produce anything there's a more proof of concept or what's the it is kind of proof of concept we've done it a few times already in smaller events and this is the largest one that we'll have done and exactly at the Dunbar number it's perfect yeah that's interesting yeah it is it is a kind of proof of concept in some ways and what I think we need to do is establish and create a field which works a community of people who are doing this together I think the UK is a good place to do that for reasons I'm going to later and I think for various cultural reasons we have a chance of avoiding the kind of almost instant polarization that we seem to see in America whenever something happens there is a there's just this instant splitting into two camps I think that's America's kind of genius in some ways is this polarization and kind of dialectic process but it's also your your drawback as well and I think the UK has a talent for synthesis and I think the way the way I think we need to do it is to build a build a field of people who are able to enter into that space that can then maintain that space against bad actors because I have a feeling that most of the the ideology that can come in and wreck conversations is is done through a kind of social shaming tactic it's done through certain keywords and certain key objections that then look for support within the within the group to derail to derail conversations and I think if we can build a functioning field where though and the other thing we've done with the with the summit is there's a sign-up form when you when you sign up that says effectively I agree to enter into this collaborative process I agree to leave my ideology at the door etc etc they'd which it's an idea we got from Brett and Heather for how they managed to to do their conversations evergreen because the other thing to realize about Brett and Heather is that both evolutionary biologists talking about the reality of biological sex differences all of these topics that have become incredibly difficult to talk about in in and around the modern left and they were doing this in one of the most progressive colleges probably the most progressive college in America and they managed to teach there for over a decade with no complaints no like that they've mastered it the people who protested against them were not their own students one of the ways they did it was to get people to sign up to a covenant when they entered into the class as that says people are on a massive hair-trigger for any sense of exclusion so the only way to deal with that is to turn around that issue into these are the ground rules you've signed up for if you choose not to obey them you're excluding yourself hmm so the only way to do it is to have a set of ground rules and then to have some way of enforcing those so someone who's willing to enforce those as well yeah yeah I mean it's what strikes me in hearing you describe your intentions for the event and and for rebel wisdom moving forward is it's a really big shift in the purpose of broadcast media right like I think if I'm gonna use a sort of simplified picture of what broadcast media has been used for in recent history it's been to kind of amplify a particular ideology so that people can make sense of the world according to that ideology whereas you know with rebel wisdom and these this whole conversational space is an invitation for individuals to take responsibility for their own sense making and their own ability to move through the world with their autonomy and sovereignty or however you want to frame it and so it's fascinating to hear how you're exploring this kind of edge where you're using broadcast media right you're doing things that are you're producing it and you're sending it out to millions of brains but the N you're trying to make that flip so that those brains look down from their devices turn off listening to some expert yeah that's a tricky that's a tricky move to make I imagine because people really like I really like you know just listening to other people talk and tell me how it is yeah but there is also a huge desire for spaces for people to to converse that's something we've really noticed when we when we bring the that space in and our live events and ask people to to express themselves there's a huge buzz in the room there's this mmm there's a real hunger for people to express themselves but there is also it's a very delicate balance to hold because it's very easy to slip back in to see I would say this has happened in America with the with the intellectual dark web it was framed as a space for brain conversations beyond polarization but has become a polarizing force in itself someone is either for or against the IDW and in some sense as soon as it was named in the New York Times the paradox was it then became defined as a thing that you were either for or against uh-huh it's very difficult I think that's part of what happens in America I think it it's almost impossible in in America to avoid that trap as soon as you define something you're then either for or against it and you just get pulled back into the same polarization trap I don't like the idea as a phenomenon has not been polarized in that way in the UK because I just assumed that that was I don't think enough people are aware of it for it to have been polarized that way in the UK okay interesting interesting interesting but yeah I mean Jordan Peterson the IDW I mean they're there already if you're in the u.s. that they put you on one side of the cultural war by definition oh yeah and it seems very difficult to avoid that process happening yes I would yeah I would direct people I'd direct people there's one there's one interview that we've done I think we're actually with Jordan green Hall and we called it the intellectual dark web and genuine conversation I think it was called well I think that's the nearest we've come me in Jordan at entering into that collaborative sense-making process on camera hmm and it's certainly true that it's an aspiration as much as it is a reality at the moment to to have those kind of conversations but I think the first step the first step really is identifying the people who are able to enter into them yes again once you've done that bringing them together and that's what I think a lot of people were very hungry for when the intellectual darkweb first kind of broke cover earlier in 2018 if you watch the conversation between Brett Eric on the Dave Rubin show and Peterson and Ben Shapiro amazingly and this was about they were talking about religion and I think it was it was pretty much Jordan Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro both following this real thread of their on their understanding of the judeo-christian framework and how Jordans understanding was able to include Ben Shapiro's and there was a real sense of intellectual engagement and connection and and and ability to come to a sort of a greater synthesis in that conversation that was really exciting and you kind of that's what I think people were really excited about was this sense of it's an alive conversation that's definitely going somewhere and there's an ability of everyone to enter into this whether someone like Ben Shapiro is able to enter into that same conversation about something like name a hot cultural war topic abortion rights or whatever rather than Ben Shapiro destroys leftists snowflake etc etc etc who knows but there was certainly a quality and a lot of those conversations that was genuinely emergent and genuinely and it comes and goes as well I think some conversations have that and some conversations don't it's a it's a process you could use a good analogy is improv comedy mm-hmm one of the the rules of improv comedy is always yes and that whenever you're doing a scene in improv comedy if someone brings something in you don't say they say oh we're on a fire engine you don't say no it's not it's a spaceship you say yes it's a fire engine and it's got a penguin driving it and it because if you don't kill the scene and so it's a yeah it's a really crucial value to bring in to any conversation is a yes and which is something I've tried to do from the beginning with rebel wisdom to say yes and to Jordan Pederson for example we've done a couple of shows the Peterson paradox and the Peterson synthesis where we we had some criticisms of Jordan Pederson I think there are things that he can be criticized on but I think we've done it from a place of genuine appreciation for the value that he's bringing and the space that he's holding and and the the skill that he has which is why and I think that value of yes and is why we've been able to have the success that we've had so far hmm yeah well and and so I also had or at least attempted to have one of these maybe we can call them generative conversations with Jordan green Hall and and somebody named Bonita Roy who I love and I suggest you speak with her if you haven't already for rebel ism she's incredible person exploring exactly this space and what was striking to me is how difficult it is to have these conversations and how systematically we've been trained not in in the opposite of the skill set that it takes to have open minded generative synthetic improvisational discourse mmm and so I remember when in the conversation with Jordan you know one of the first things he said was you got to figure out if somebody they were speaking with is actually capable of doing this thing that we're talking about mmm and so you know III guess what comes to mind is the other work that you're doing around retreats and workshops you know it makes sense to me now at this point in the conversation the the connection between those two elements of your work right I mean if we need to have these generative discourses as a civilization in order to really kind of quote-unquote make it through this I have the needle that we're headed up to then we we need we need to unlearn a lot of things and we need to learn a lot of things and we need to do it pretty quick it seems like yes and so yeah that just kind of clicked for me it makes sense now the whole kind of I guess that the larger business model or the larger operating of rebel wisdom yeah I think yeah I'm certainly feeling the the pressure of time I think since the Trump election I had a I had a feeling that he was going to get elected and I had a very strong sense of for quite a long time had a very strong sense that this kind of these structures that we're taking for granted are nowhere near as stable as we think they are and and the things have the chance have the potential to kind of go south very quickly and I certainly feel that and and yeah that that is the thing that we need is we need to develop these skills into subjective generative emergent dialogue very very urgently and I think everyone else in this space I know Jamie wheel feels this very keenly as well Jordan green Hall I'd probably add brett weinstein to that as well recognizes how difficult this project is and how we're kind of threading the eye of a needle in some sense mmm-hmm and the it's not an easy thing to do and it's very easy to come out of Jordan Greenhalgh talks about sovereignty when we're in sovereignty and when we're not there's a few people that I think should be brought into the conversation as well and there's this work that's been done in in Euro I guess you call it neuro neurobiology around something called polyvagal theory and somatic work which completely revolutionized the the work of transformation or kind of the more personal growth work that we do where we realize now a lot more about trauma and trauma is defined as anything we're not able to integrate and this this realization that the the importance of the vagus nerve in moderating our sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system we are either I don't want to go too much into the science of it but effectively we are either in an exploratory framework or we're in a defensive framework and if we're in a defensive framework we are unavailable we're unavailable for inquiry we're unavailable for curiosity were unavailable for dialogue whereas if we're in the the more positive space I need to learn more about this as well I'm kind of I'm at the edge of my my knowledge but I want to talk to two of the guys who who've done this work if we're in this exploratory framework that's when we're curious when we're inquiring when we're in a space of genuine and we do this in our workshops as well we call it inquiry and we ask people sort of close your eyes going be curious about what you find be curious about what happens in your life talk to this other person and come from a space of genuine inquiry why do I do this well I've never I've never thought about how these things fit together before I never realize that this might be a reason that I do this and that's an absolutely essential skill and it's one that we have to very consciously develop and there are various other ways of doing that as well I know maybe other listeners to this have heard of something called circling circling is a practice that is very much based on the same principles as inquiry hmm what am i feeling what is happening in the space that's arising between us as I'm talking well and being genuinely curious and and that can only happen from a place of sovereignty in a place of where we're not being pulled out of that space by a stuff for want of a better word yeah it's a tricky position to be in because I'm the one hand I also like you mentioned I feel this urgency like it does feel like time is running out and I don't know how true that is or if that's just a sense and I invite anybody listening to come and tell me why I shouldn't feel that way I would prefer not to feel that way actually but nonetheless I do feel that way right now that there's no sense that time is running out and and yet it seems that like all these thinkers and and in my own experience and I'm hearing this from you we're kind of triangulating towards we actually have to go really slow now and be really curious and exploratory and open and generative and it's like oh that's a very tricky chasm to kind of lock down like on either side you fall over and it's a needle before yeah yeah it is very much so like threading a needle and I guess this is a mysterious to hear your thoughts on this are you are you optimistic I am I think it's I think it goes back to Star Wars Luke in Star Wars feeling the force kind of taking away his guidance system I mean that is a modern myth that's our modern religion so it's got to be true there is there's I mean I Lyla I laugh it's kind of a I'm being only slightly facetious I do think that there is something in that I do think there's something in yeah we need to gain access to that liminal space we need to gain access to that space that that knows what to do that knows what what is a propria to the times and I think and unless we're acting from that space then I think whatever we bring forth is not going to be equal to the times hmm and then and I also feel certainly that sense of time running out it's not helped when some of the most intelligent people we've interviewed have are also saying the same thing but also it's like what is I as a journalist I look around at the world and I see so many existential threats that that it's it's I mean at the moment a lot of people are focusing primarily on the environmental threat yeah but I I look at I look at world politics I look at kind of where we're still only halfway through the Trump presidency I mean I I just see so many threats that on on the horizon that it's it's difficult to get kind of overwhelmed by any particular one mm-hmm yeah right well yeah I want to go too far into the existential risk rabbit hole yeah I just know enough to be very worried I mean I know we we've kind of interacted online around this as well like Pam yeah I'm concerned at how neatly so many of so much of the kind of apocalyptic thinking maps on to the deep religious framework yeah yeah yeah I've seen you mention that yeah well describe your position on that because I'd love to talk to you a little bit about this all I would I mean I don't know the I'm not a climate scientist for example so I don't want to go too deeply into the science or express an opinion about that but I would say I don't see many people coming forward with what I would consider to be an integral or a balance framework around climate change for example and I'm which I think would acknowledge certainly how neatly it fits on to a very sort of religious framework we'll all we're all doomed we need to repent right now yes is it genuinely about climate change or is it about changing people if you heard that there's a technological solution tomorrow for climate change how would that make you feel will you be relieved or would you actually think no that's not the point the point is that people need to stop being selfish they need to stop being disrespectful to the environment to stop being etc etc what what's the deeper it is it about changing people or is it about changing the environment I mean that would be that'd be one suggestion but the other the other key thing I mentioned an integral framework for me that would be to say yes there are all of these factors that are pushing us towards apocalyptic thinking on on this subject and yet yes right because I don't see much acknowledgement this seems to be this sort of pseudo naivety among people I'd say sort of a more kind of apocalyptic on on climate stuff that that seems to say no everything settled science is science is completely objective it's like so enter the human is a human endeavor like anything else grant money is given for certain things I know how the media works there are big institutional biases yes towards a certain narrative and towards groupthink on these things I'm not saying that it's wrong but I would like to hear people acknowledge that and say but still I believe this because of this this or this and I don't see that I don't see an ability to hold that complexity among a lot of people in this space and if I'm really honest the people that I see with the ability to hold that kind of complexity I often find coming from a place of less apocalyptic rhetoric around climate specifically that's not to say there are not other kind of big existential threats as well yeah yeah well and I've had a lot of conversations on the podcast and some more coming up about existential risk and climate collapse and all of those very real spectres and at the very least in our in our psyches and and for me the the through line for this entire conversation we've been having is like if you're certain about it then you shut down so much of what's needed in any case like it's not like it's gonna be an apocalypse and all sudden you just cease to exist like things are gonna change rapidly and you're going to be called forth to respond in ways that you don't even know about right or like things will get better and you'll play a part in that or we but we just don't know and so that the boring thing is to be certain yeah and the only honest answer is to just be more deeply uncertain or at least you know reasonably uncertain like just like and that and that keeps open that space of possibility which I think you know from our conversation I feel more like that's really a lot of the gift of the IDW is that they're just opening up this space of possibility where something new can be born yeah and the the lesson if anything is beware of ideology aka beware of certainty beware of anything that tries to put things in a neat box and then tie it up and put it in a closet like let's just keep this going that there's a kind of dialogical process that we can engage in yeah yes certainty I mean I find I find especially like the climate peace at the moment I'm not gonna say terrifying but I am very perturbed by how much certainty there is and how out of control the rhetoric can get when it is framed as we are facing imminent extinction what are you going to do about this imminent extinction I mean though that there's nothing off the table once things are framed in that way there's nothing that you can there's nothing that you would really rule out if you're establishing that those are the stakes and that's how near we are and that's where that's the level of response that we're required to give again and I I do worry what kind of yeah what because it's also a kind of catch-22 because by framing yourself as wanting nuance or wanting a conversation or wanting some kind of dialogue around that you can be framed as well you're just not taking this seriously you are a Noir on the side of the extermination of life on Earth yeah well I've curious you know you're in the UK and I've been watching the development of the extinction rebellion do you have any kind of commentary on that any perspective on that that's what I was thinking I I was aware as I was talking you guys it hasn't kind of broken cover quite as much in the US as it has in the UK so extinction rebellion is a kind of grassroots Climate movement that has a very yeah I find a lot of things that they do I found I find their use of skulls very troubling they're a lot they use a lot of iconography based around skulls and if I kind of look back at what other organizations in the past of sort of driven political movements based around skulls I find it very interesting that that's the kind of iconography that they're choosing to use I'm not sort of saying that there's never any place for activism there clearly is but it's a very different thing to to inquiry and and that's what I'm personally interested in and want to kind of see more of yeah I'll probably get into trouble for the skulls thing yeah it's curious I mean I've been watching it over here I had one of the co-founders Gail Bradbrook on the show and and at least and and I know because I participate in Occupy Wall Street that be there can be a lot of philosophical robustness and nuance in the mind and heart of the founders or the instigators but then it you know to some degree it's out of your hands by the time it becomes a mass movement and then it can go anywhere you know it is in some respects a kind of collective intelligence that you don't have control over anymore and so I loved Gale and I thought that she had beautiful perspectives on grieving and the need to be honest with ourselves about what we're doing to the planet whether or not were you know destroying it we're certainly messing it up pretty bad and you know like that's that's undeniable and but then yeah like it can easily escape the embrace of the people who have good intentions who founded it it also reminds me a little bit of Jonathan Heights work around the coddling of the American mind where he talked about how this culture of kind of microaggressions on campus was effectively was really count and basically students being told always to take things the worst possible way hmm was direct and a lot of the the reasoning that was coming through in the last few years was directly counter to what you'd be taught in cognitive behavioral therapy for example which says whenever you have a thought think about whether that thought is true what that thought means and and just to stop yourself catastrophizing most of the time and I do worry that there's a lot of catastrophizing going on yeah personally I'll just share my perspective on and this is that I kind of choose to act as if extinction is an is a real threat because it calls me forth to participate in life in a more beautiful and meaningful way you know like the kind of person that I become when I live in a time when like everything's on the line is more the person I want to be than the person who I would be if I thought that things were chill and so there's a little bit of motivated reasoning there on my part but I actually think that's that's kind of okay like we're all doing that in our own way yes I think I'd agree with that I think I implicitly feel the same in the glitch in the matrix film Jordan greenhalgh talked about this polarization driven by social media as an existential threat that we be cut we we broken off into two camps effectively humans had different capabilities and what we've seen is those with certain capabilities going off into one camp and certain capabilities going off into the other camp and that that splitting was existential II was an existential threat and I agree I agree with that I feel that we are in the times where the stakes are that high and I know that my particular piece is in trying to create a dialogue and it's a sense making thing I mean basically what rebel wisdom is is an attempt to make to create a sense making framework Network and create the space for into subjective sense making to emerge and that I'm I'm convinced that is my particular piece to own in the existential struggle that we're going through beautiful.i it's honorable and important work and I think I mean from just my perspective you're doing a great job like it's really it's helping me make sense and it's helping a lot of people I know make sense of the world so yeah and and it's also you know part of what is drawing me forth into this in this conversation and so it's it's an exciting time to be doing this kind of work I think and so as we kind of draw towards the end of this conversation I'm curious David if there's anything on your mind or in your heart they'd like to share with the folks who might be listening no let me think we've just brought out a few films with ken wilber mm-hmm which is something we haven't mentioned so far but I know that we we both share an interesting kind of that framework and it's something that yeah I guess I kind of end by saying I do think there's a lot of other perspectives that I saw the intellectual dark web as the beginnings of this conversation and I do think that there are really important voices that need to be added to it and I think for example Ken Wilber in the integral framework that he produced was a really important map and it's one that I think Jamie wheel said to me recently that a lot of people who are currently breaking trail are running an integral OS yes integral operating system and I think that's that's probably true and and I yeah I just I guess I just heard to be able to kind of have a look at the channel and we're trying to follow the thread of this emergent conversation as I I know you are on your podcast as well and yeah maybe get in touch and suggest some other people that we might want to speak to because I I'm sort of making so far I've been going mostly on instinct of you know what are the pieces that are missing where do we need to go how do we bring this person into the conversation what does this person have to add and I I don't know if you're familiar with the Enneagram yes yeah so I'm if anyone knows the Enneagram it's a it's a really interesting personality tool so I'm in Enneagram five hey me too oh yeah that's the the curator the curio Errol well the Enneagram five that it's the detached observer I mean I'm yeah that's stereotypical Enneagram five it's the philosopher the journalist but yeah the five is to be a is to be a sort of slightly detached and be able to see how things fit together so that's really what I hope and what my aim is with rebel wisdom is to stay open enough myself and my co-founder Alexander Byner who is running the events and between us to really stay open to where this conversation wants to go and to be able to respond to it and - yeah - help to help it emerge in the way that it wants to emerging to continue to get out of our own way enough to be able to to to allow it to come through in the way that it wants to if that's not 234 your audience probably it's like a few like it it's a beautiful intention yeah thank you thank you for this conversation and and thank you for the work you're doing I think it's it's very valuable yeah thank you it's been a pleasure [Music] you
