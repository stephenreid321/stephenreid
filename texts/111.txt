and how would you summarize why men are in crisis now I think it's because in a deep level the West has lost faith in the idea of masculinity now that's no different than the death of God it's the same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be I mean that's most of what he wrote about you know and so you'd say well the divine symbol of masculinity has been obliterated well so then what do you expect what it what's gonna happen it's gonna that means masculinity is going to become weak and especially if the symbol is also denigrated right which it definitely is so what that means is that the ideal that man could aspire to is denigrated and well then with your ideal in tatters you're weak that's that's definitional so I think the reason that men have been responding positively to my my thinking let's say is that I don't buy any of that I like the masculine spirit it's necessary and it's not fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's not fundamentally rape culture you know it's not fundamentally world destroying and all of those things have been all of those aspersions have been cast upon it that's partly the guilt of Western society for technological progress even and those are reasonable challenges to be set before men but they're not reasonable accusations to swallow without criticism what is a masculinity we can aspire to wow it's a responsibility fundamentally and and it's it's it's to put it symbolically is that your your responsibility is to incarnate the Spirit of the logos that's your responsibility that's your role in life and that is independent to some degree in whether or not you accept the idea of a transcendent and eternal reality now I'm not making a case for that or against that I those things are beyond human understanding but we know what happens if people act poorly if man act badly we know what happens we know that the world turns into something that's so close to hell that the difference is trivial we know that that's the story of the 20th century so we should learn that lesson and what that lesson is is pick up the world on your shoulders and walk forward pick up the world with all of its trouble with all of its suffering with all of its evil and move forward with it and in bearing that burden learn that you're the sort of creature that can bear that burden and therefore deserving of respect that's that's the that's identification with the logos and that's I don't I've never encountered an idea that's better than that because it's not it's so not naive it's the opposite of naive it's like there's terrible evil and there's terrible suffering it's bottomless but the human spirit is capable of voluntarily taking that on as a challenge well it's worth a try yes exactly that's that's that's that's the positive meaning that's the positive meaning that's the world affirming meaning you know and that that's that self-esteem let's say you know which is very poorly characterized it's very shallowly characterized because it usually doesn't involve any sense of responsibility but you know it's obvious if you it's obvious in some ways if you look at the people that other people spontaneously respect unless they've become unbelievably cynical it's the people who adopt responsibility and deal with it competently so it's not a mystery that that would be what you could aspire to now it gets undermined if you feel that that force of responsibility is the the raping and pillaging patriarchal culture that's despoiling the natural environment and that's equivalent to a cancer well you know no I don't buy that
