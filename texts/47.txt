[Music] so guys this is a very quick film about rebel wisdom live we had an amazing event last night within McGilchrist the author of mastering his emissary and we also recorded an interview with him in this room that we're going to release as well in the next couple of weeks we're gonna put a few clips from the live event in this film starting now you know this is called rebel wisdom I just want people to be rebellious against the status quo all the things you're told all the managerial guff that overlays the reality and vividness and vitality of our lives and come down to the brass tacks of what's important and stand up for it so thank you to everyone who tuned in to livestream last night and also thank you to everyone who came to the event we sold out which was great the level of conversation in the livestream was brilliant was actually really funny lots of fun and the quality of the questions was also excellent and we actually asked Ian some of the questions from the live stream like this one so we'll take a question from the live stream which is from Jenny Magnus a consistent thread through the book is the idea betweenness could even say more about what he means by this and why it's important yes try to do this briefly and think of an electric current it's it's manifest between two poles a positive and a negative pole it's not in the positive pole it's not in the negative pole it's not even in the positive pole plus the negative pole nor is it in the space between the two poles because that space is nothing it's in the hole between this of the two poles and what that brings about at a wholly different level a good analogy is music music is all between this so take a note an a-flat what does it mean absolutely nothing take another one Abby it means absolutely nothing put 30,000 of these things together and you've got varsity minor mass so what happened there which means a hell of a lot and it's not in the notes so it must be in the spaces between the notes but the spaces between the notes and a melody are just silence the spaces between notes in harmony are just silence the spaces between the beat of the rhythm are not bad what say you put a lot of things that mean nothing together and a lot of spaces that mean nothing together you find something that means more than almost anything you can experience in the world how does that happen the answer is if you like between this so what we underestimate bringing it down to earth is that we are not you know we are not atomistic there is no way in which I exist independently of all of you and of all of the the planet and all of the people who came before me and indeed in a strange way I'm part of something that is to come that is all not in me or in them or in some sort of gaps between us but is in the between us that's what I mean by it and it's thank you Jenny for raising the point because it is absolutely fundamental to my philosophy and it's another way of talking about what I was talking about earlier that I'm writing about right now so we've been talking a lot about how we do this going forward and what we've decided is that we're going to obviously always stream the talks live on YouTube so anyone who wants you can tune in and then we're going to put the film of the talk up on patreon and anyone who's a $5 plus a month subscriber can watch the talk in its entirety when it's up there so we've actually stolen this format from Sam Harris from any of the same reasons a major one is that a live event is it's quite a different beast to sit down interview and we don't have as much control over the quality of it so the event video that we're showing clips with here is not the same as the live feed it's the it's the feed from the camera that's running at the same time so it's high-res it's better quality than the live stream but as it's a similar decision as you said that Sam Harris made which is the the best quality content the the podcasts or the interviews that we're doing where we can definitely sort of control the environment that is a sort of signature dish so we're going to put that out on the main channel and the events which are slightly harder to control will be for patrons only and generally whenever we're doing a live event we're going to have an interview with that guests at the foot beforehand we'll get them in to the studio a little bit before the event so we'll have the interview to go up alongside and we also have to think sort of long term about how we make this sustainable and the way to do that that we've chosen is to really ramp up the patreon content and increase the number of people who are subscribing on patreon so and also at the same time we're going to be taking questions we're trying to involve the community as much as possible in this conversation asking them for questions for our upcoming interviews asking the livestream audience for questions during the live stream a little bit like this one there play another clip it's mine no matter aspects are the same thing what is that thing well of course we did have a word for it but then can I answer with an analogy everybody knows what water is it's a transparent liquid that flows but there's also this funny opaque very cold substance that is entirely a mobile ice there is also this absolutely invisible something in the air which is also water vapor so water exists in different phases which of them is water they're all water if you like or they're all not water there now I see the relationship very briefly I'd need a lot longer between matter and consciousness as being like this that consciousness is as it were the final substrate matter is something a form of consciousness and element in consciousness in physics terms a phase of consciousness in the same way that ice is a phase of water so see the rest of Emma Gilchrist divided reign divided world stand up as a patron and the next rebel wisdom live is going to be a little bit different than the ones we've had before it's called occult politics in the time of chaos and we've got two speakers there's Gary Lachman who's been on the channel before and he's written a book called Dark Star rising looking at how the occult and esoteric practices influence Trump's rise to power and how they might still be influencing world politics and then we have Julian vane who is also an expert on esoteric culture and history and written a number of books so we're gonna have both of them we're gonna have both of them up for the Q&A and it's going to be very very interesting I think so tune in for that that's going to be on December 4th in London live but obviously live streamed as well and there'll be more information than that before it happens thank you for watching and see you soon [Music] you
