[Music] so this is a third podcast and yeah so the last one we offered a constructive critique of John Peterson and in this one we're going to go through some of the comments the feedback underneath the video and and else we're trying give a bit more context and respond to what some are really sort of valid comments criticisms and ultimately like so we put out a video and I wrote a really long novel on medium which will link to under this as well and what was interesting is sort of developing as Peterson says I write to know what I think and I really felt like by writing it I was sort of getting to know more of what actually thought about it and then reading people's responses helping that kind of conversation as well so there's this these two images to Peter someone on that on one side is like Peterson's a cult and it's his followers are just kind of idle worshiping and it's and the other side of which I think more true that Peterson's actually become a filter for three thinkers because you have to you have to have some sense of I'm not going to listen to what they think I should think about this guy to be interested in it you have to go through the pain of kind of my friends might judge me because I'm into this guy and come out the other side and what was amazing in the responses in the comments was it really felt like he is this filter for freethinkers the the vast majority of them were offering constructive criticism all of us and constructive criticism of him and it felt like a very healthy conversation yeah yeah and I think I shared that kind of nervousness maybe from me from from a different angle which was the you know Peterson has had so much ad hominem attack from the media and also just outright lies as well there's been a lot of that so there's a nuance to critique tactics which i think was was kind of the bulk of our podcast critiquing an individual which is really what the the media has done and which for me has no place in rebel wisdom is its you know the third thing is critiquing ideas you know and those things you know critiquing tactics in particular I think is a really important thing but also critiquing the delivery of those ideas yeah that's that's a good point yeah which which for me links into tactics as well I think that what we're doing is offering it in the spirit of Peterson himself what is not required is unconditional positive regard what is required is genuinely wanting success and wanting the best of him and the best of this to succeed and I hope that we are coming from that place I mean only other I mean people would do make their own judgments but I genuinely believe I've wrestled with this stuff we've wrestled with this stuff and we're trying to come from that place and so I just yeah it's one a recap just in case people are watching this without having watched the first podcast we basically said three things that the message could be framed in a way that would reach people that are resistant to at the moment that they're maybe he could look at retreating from some of the sort of daily combat the media firefighting stuff kind of he's off he's talked before about you shouldn't put pearls before swine and maybe it's getting to that stage and also that I am not seeing the same JP as I did a while ago and it would be almost impossible for him to be the same because of the unfair attacks that he's had but why the Kathy Newman interview worked was that he it wasn't just he had the facts and he out did her on that level there was a humor and a wit and a performance to that that won people over and I actually messaged him after that he was still he wasn't famous he is now so culprit ply at that point just to say wow fantastically well done on that interview I know that that will reach people who were resistant already and I don't see so much of that anymore so that was kind of the other part of it yeah and just at that point after the Kathy Newman interview he mentioned you know he talked about animus possession and he talked about if you engage in the argument with you know with the energy Kathy Newman was coming from you've already lost the argument and in a sense I think the more he's delved into the mainstream media and the more they've started to kind of direct the conversation the more and more it's been more difficult not to engage in that argument you know so I think that's that's part of the kind of expanding out of the reason for those tactics being important I think yeah and one more point that actually came out in the writing of the article and in some of the feedback is is there a deeper theological point or resolution than what Peterson's putting out there and I'm gonna unpack and explore that with Louise Mazzanti who appeared in the glitch in the matrix film hello so we thought it would be interesting to kind of delve into the comment and then pick out different critiques or ideas or things people were adding so the first one wanted to talk about is in a couple of the comments this idea of what I call like the Fairweather friends argument of you know this is this isn't the time to be criticizing Peterson you know he needs support right now you know you shouldn't be doing that so so what's your take on that I think this goes to the heart of what we were saying really the idea that polarization encourages this son of a some men mentality and ultimately I think what Peterson is is saying is trying to get us the other side of this and this is something I reckon Brett Weinstein talked about in the Dave Rubin podcast which is incredible if anyone's not seeing it go and watch it amazing amazing podcast they said that in the past speaking out against being ejected from your tribe would have been a fatal thing throughout most of human history so we we have this as a kind of internalized biological reality that this kind of feminist is tribalism which I would argue is why with like me to wipe ourselves out if we don't evolve to the past this kind of reactivity is social media makes it worse everything makes it worse and at the moment this kind of polarization or this kind of dynamic is is seem to be at its peak and Pedersen is the one man kind of lightning rod for this new culture wars I think to add to that as well that there's there's an interesting concept of you know a tribe of individuals very different from from a different kind of tribe and I think a big part of Peterson's message is in the primacy of the individual of your own experience and your own truth I'm speaking the truth certainly if I was going to pick a side I know its side I pick but I'm trying to kind of see that is there a chance that we can get past this whole game of picking sides we might be naive we might be wrong and I certainly felt in myself as we put the stuff out there this sort of sense of nervousness and sense of kind of is this right am i betraying something fighting with this other sense of no this is my truth this is what I have to add to the conversation and I have to and I have to add this like Peterson talks about it's like things go corrupt when people don't speak their truth and I might be wrong I mean this is an ongoing conversation it's ongoing I mean that's another thing that he says it's like what the do you know I mean you're an idiot you know you don't know enough by definition I don't know enough by definition we don't know enough by definition we're all kind of groping towards the truth as best we can and this is what we're trying to do and I believe that we're also like we're teaching men's work as well and this is a core part of what we're teaching like speaking your truth giving your brother's honest reflections and being really reflective of what is coming up in myself at the same time whether I'm just projecting my own kind of sense of superiority or whatever out onto the world and try it we're in the process of trying to do that at the same time and I think the key word is it's a process it is a process of like you've said you know you speak to know you speak to think and it's a process in the men's work as well of especially that people often find it difficult to reflect to to you know another guy in the group of the things of hey hip man here's where I see your blind spots and you know in the groups we go around and we'll kind of listen in and the circles and be like and if someone is kind of falling in to pleasing of like oh yeah you can sometimes be a little bit mean but you're really great otherwise you know it's like you you know one of the things office say is you're not serving you're not helping him you're not helping him by pleasing the help will be reflection because we cannot see our own blind spots by definition so that's why the college that yeah so to move on to another question a kind of a couple of comments around the theme of you guys have lost your nerve have you lost your nerve David it would have been much easier for us to carry on and we are going to carry on doing sort of Peterson themed interviews and work because I think the the perspective that he's bringing is the most complete thing I've ever seen and so we are going to use it as a window into other thinkers and the window into in terms of broadening broadening out as much as we can and it it would have been much easier not to do this so have we lost our nerve I don't think so one or two comments around yeah you piggybacked you know with piggybacked on Peterson and then now we're stabbing him in the back by critiquing him what are your thoughts on that and also there was one guy who said and that's not what men do men back each other up it's like I have I was genuinely concerned that he might think that as well like I actually sent him a message about that a while ago saying look I I'm really trying to act ethically we the interview gave us really did give us a boost and allow us to kind of attract attention with rebel wisdom and you are he also uploaded the glitch in the matrix to his channel which gave us another boost as well and I'm eternally grateful for that all I can do is explain where I'm coming from and how it's got to this point and people can make their own judgments as to whether that's piggybacking on his success or not I used to be a journalist well I am that I am a journalist documentary maker reporter I work for channel 4 news for many years I made documentaries I found Peterson July no June of last year and I immediately became hooked and I wrote the medium article truth in the time of chaos one of the first medium articles I think about him where I transcribed a load of his stuff and put up no 3,000 words something like that and it was because of that that I then got the interview with him when I was going to the leaf of going over to one of the Bible lectures and then thought well I'm a journalist I might save and get interview with him sent him that the article and he really liked it said he done it's a very careful job and he was happy to do an interview which I'm again very grateful for and then after doing the interview I then thought well from the beginning I've been thinking there's a lot of people who are just not seeing this message they're getting hung up on the political stuff they're not seeing what he's actually about and so I thought okay I'm gonna make a documentary and so I made truth in the time of chaos to try and provide that kind of context to explain what he was really about like the theological stuff in the interview I did with him we didn't talk about the trans stuff or the pollak politic stuff at all the least interesting thing about him in my view is the politic stuff the most interesting thing is the deep the deep mythological the deep archetype or the de Young in integration which he's bringing forward and so a lot of what we talked about was about synchronicity and about young and it was about this kind of deeper message and so I put that article that documentary out and then the Kathy Newman interview happened and I was kind of trying to leave behind the scenes between him and Kathy for a while and because that's what I thought it was amazing synchronicity we we talked about synchronicity that was basically the topic of our conversation and synchronicity being like amazing coincidences that tell you something meaningful like there's some there's some how mentor and then he comes to the UK I'm the only person who's done a documentary about him he then leads to fame on the show I used to work on with Kathy Newman who is an ex colleague of mine and I I message them both immediately after the interview independently to say to Peterson as I just said well that well done that was amazing I think the humor and the wit that's probably one people over and to Kathy to say I really liked that the way that you you guys warm to each other by the end because there was a kind of genuine kind of kind of respect by the end and they both responded and and then this whole thing blew up and I really felt I was like wow this is an amazing position and I really wanted to kind of Liege between them for a while that's what I thought I was meant to do it's like what's the meaning of the synchronicity where you're meant to kind of try and help them renegotiate because on one side Peterson was very upset on one side I know for sure that they were it wasn't spin like Kathy did feel under attack Channel 4 News did feel under attack it wasn't spin I do have my doubts about that then calling in security experts or or the fact that they put that out I think I mean they're journalists they know how to may know how to control the narrative I do have my suspicions around them doing that which I didn't at the time but I developed them afterwards but Peterson was very angry about the fact that it was now being spun as Kathy was a victim and all their stuff and I completely understood his perspective as well and I agree with it but I also knew that from inside channel 4 news that's not what they were thinking they were genuinely were upset at the comments that Kathy was getting and I know that privately they were getting some really horrific stuff so it wasn't I could see both sides and I was trying kind of the ACE and Peterson was interested in in having a second interview and wanted to do to do it Channel 4 News just wanted it to go away so eventually I was like a case of what am I meant to do with this I and I realized okay I'll put out glitch in the matrix or just all of these ideas that have been sort of bubbling away about since the Trump election I then downloaded in you glitching the matrix put it together in about two weeks and I was in the Channel 4 News newsroom two weeks before I put that documentary out freelancing there my freelance there since I left I knew I would not be able to go back into that newsroom when I put that documentary out just they were critic criticisms of Channel 4 News in there I was pretty much weighing into the debate around Kathy Newman where they just wanted to protect her at that time understandably because some of the some of the abuse she was getting was really serious and I knew it makes things incredibly difficult so but I made that decision at that point that I would that that wasn't my path anymore that actually this creating rebel wisdom outside the mainstream media has been the thing that I've decided to do so I was kind of I was accepting the possibility that I was ending my career in news and current affairs by doing putting that out I was being disloyal to them so people can judge as to whether that's a sacrifice or not and I think Peterson's probably made bigger sacrifices but I think I have taken decisions that I think I do have skin in this game so what you're saying is we live in the matrix what I'm saying is yes watch glitch in the matrix another interesting question is is you know people were asking well are we saying that Peterson should censor himself or should he you know should he change his tone what do you thoughts on that I don't think he should stop speaking the truth I think he should just do it smarter I think that and this is something that Andrew Sweeney who wrote a blog post alongside it talked about that this idea of the castration cult the sort of great mother and what was seeing if you'd kind of look at it from the archetypal perspective the media is acting like a castration cult Peterson needs to behave and he's to stop being angry he needs to do this it's like this kind of lecturing finger wagging kind of anti masculine tone to a lot of a lot of it which and we're not saying Peterson needs to behave and buts what I am saying is that I think he could frame it in a way that would that would reach more people and that I think he is because at first I was thinking well he's just speaking the truth and just allowing it to fall as it will it's fine if the media misrepresents him he's not playing the media game which I had some sympathy for but I don't think that's true I think he is playing the media game in some ways like think about Milo he's never been on Milo's show I I assume that Milo would want him in a heartbeat he's made a decision not to go on Milo show I'm assuming I might be wrong I'm just speculating here but he's gone on just about everyone else's so he's made a decision to keep a distance from Milo I think he's right to keep a distance from Lyle I think Milo is now damaged goods and Milo is kind of a textbook example of what can happen Milo's a provocateur peterson on a provocateur he's provocate he's provoking a response but he's not doing it deliberately Milo was doing it deliberately so there was a kind of he was playing with fire and the danger with petersen like mine I was still doing okay got his own podcast he's probably never going to want four people to provide him money he still got a fanbase but he is at in terms of his influence on the national conversation or the international conversation it's zero he is now he has been defined and discarded by the national conversation Peterson is too important for that to happen to and I think he is a different character than Milo and I think he has different motivations with Milo as it was a case of this was kind of bound to happen he was a shooting star that was bound to flame out I'm not convinced that the Peterson is bound to flame out or should flame out I think he's bringing something that's still gonna be relevant to the like two hundred years time whereas I don't think Milo is and one of the reasons they dropped his book is it was complete if you read the reports he's he was saying he was made a career up saying things that no one else would say but apart from that he he's not it's not an intellect it's not on the same level of someone like Peterson yeah that brings me to another point that kind of came up in the comments as well which is slightly link to it this idea of you know you well you can't talk to the radical left there's no talking to them there's no point in trying to win them over you know etc the way I see the link to that is that the media the mainstream media is kind of the act a big access point to the kind of really radical sjw's my thinking on that is that I think there's truth in that I think the most radical extreme they're not reachable by Peterson's message there you know but I don't think they're the majority by any means in fact the the audience that dimension media allows you to talk to is the massive group of fairly reasonable open-minded people on the Left who really could use Peterson's message who need to be read pilled effectively and that that makes it matter the tactics you use to reach them because they are they are being kind of shamed into having a certain worldview which is based around shame that kind of social justice worldview and that's a strong pull on them of like you're not allowed to listen to this person because it's they have a deep concern with how you think what you believe and they can take things like hit pieces and make it a very effective tool to keep people there so yeah there's two things here one Peterson says that sanity is out sourced like sanity is such a complicated problem that we outsource it to other people in some ways we we we moderate our behavior by the reaction that we have from other people so sense making is also out sourced we we we all to some degree either we make up our own minds or we follow others but we can't make up our own minds all the time like we all have these we take cues from what other people like or from from people that we see on Twitter it's impossible to make up our own minds entirely about every single thing all the time we're always influenced by what other people are thinking and and some kind of peer not peer pressure but but peer like our anchor points so and my worry is that Peterson has lost a lot of key anchor points who are not interested in sort of delving in deeper into his message I on my Twitter feed I try and have a balance I try and balance it with different perspectives and I see a lot of reasonable intelligent left-leaning journalists who I consider open-minded and reachable sharing sort of Peterson hit pieces and saying well I always knew there was something about this guy and now I realize so I feel like he's losing that Center so another thing that's come up in the comments is that what is most striking about the podcast is that all the advice we were giving Peterson applies much much more to the regressive left the kind of social justice mindset by a factor of like a million what are your thoughts yes it's true absolutely true it does doesn't mean that that 2% or 5% is irrelevant and I've written extensively about kind of less reactivity and we will talk a lot more about that but it doesn't mean that there is nothing to learn on the other side and I've kind of reflect on Jocko Willick Peterson's been on jaha willing to podcast he talks about extreme ownership the buck stops with me he talks about when things went wrong up on a tour in Iraq and he just said it's my fault good if you say it's my fault whatever reaction you're getting whatever people are misunderstanding if you say it's my fault suddenly you're you then have some ownership of it if you just keep saying no it's just then it's just then they're doing this they're doing this then that's a very weak position to be in because you can't do anything about it if you accept that you can do anything about anything then you're empowering yourself there's this other sense of if you're in an argument with someone you and you can't seem to get through it and you can tell they're being completely unreasonable the only way out of that argument either you kind of fight or you don't see that person anymore if you want to get through that argue and says a family member and you have no choice but to get through that argument if you are seeing more of the dynamics than the person who's reacting to you you're the only one that can shift that dynamic actually is that unfair if they're being unreasonable yes it's completely unfair tough life is unfair but you the only person who can shift the dynamics is the person who's seen the bigger picture and I think Peterson has the capacity to see a bigger picture that the media just doesn't have and I do think there are there are ways of framing that will at least kind of talk to the middle if not yeah the extremes are kind of unreachable I think that Peterson he's channeling like this this old spirit of the divine masculine and it is absolutely essential we cannot do without it and he is channeling this thing into the culture in a big way and his successes shows how much we're thirsting for it this this important masculine energy but it needs to be matched by a feminine energy of equal power and weight because and I think this is this is why I think there is some truth in like the New York Times article that called him custodian of the patriarchy I think on some level I do think he may and may be quite rightly is concerned about what's happened since the 60s like we have started sharing space between men and women is that gonna work out or is there not going to work out we don't know it's clearly creating huge difficulties and I think he's genuinely not sure whether it's a good idea or a bad idea I think people are picking up on that and criticizing him for it but ultimately we're not going to wind the clock back we are going to have to go through and forward and find this synthesis which is going to be as Jordan Greenhalgh talks about what we have and he also frames it by saying these are very difficult conversations to have these are hugely important but very difficult conversations to have we have the feminine rising into power power and we also need the feminine to rise into responsibility at the same time and those two things need happen need to happen at the same time and it's it's certainly true that women now have power to destroy men destroy men's reputations destroy men's careers and that power and it's it's right that some people do have their careers destroyed and some people do have the reputations ruined that's right we're not going back to the 1950s sort of madmen culture but also that with great power comes great responsibility I think for me what woke me up as a woman about Jordan Peterson was that he was beginning to talk about a longing in culture and longing we are in this time of cares and where are the axioms where are the things that are true at a deeper levels and you know as women we already know that there are these truths we've just been really really trained to not feel it and not speak it and he speaks to her but and I really like the way that he's saying hello man where are you where is a divine masculine because the divine feminine has has come massively into the world none of the divine feminine but you know that with a lot of shadow as well Carly exactly chopping off and saying enough yeah but it's run amok and we need the divine masculine we need to strong the deep the mature masculine to stand up and say I'm here and we need we need the feminine to do the same and that's what I feel is is what Peterson is is pointing yet but missing out and he's speaking more he's speaking more to men he's speaking more to the masculine I don't feel that he's saying the feminine is not important at all but he's creating a space and I want women to stand up and say okay what is this space from a woman's perspective how can we fill this space but this and this also you were just saying the Divine Feminine is showing up a lot of Carly at the moment brilliant kind of archetypal framework and it's like and it's absolutely right that she does because men need to find their their grounding men need to find their balls men need to find to stay masculinity and say enough women test men to see how grounded they are that happens automatically it needs to happen women evolutionarily that has to happen women have to test men like you women had a far bigger investment in childbirth and bringing up children and so women constantly test men they it's an evolutionary necessity and it's actually something that's very valuable to men too for that to happen it's like that's how we evolved is is through that kind of being tested and standing in our truth and standing in our masculinity and women are very there's a kind of idea of men or concept men test ideas and women test men now it's very easy to misunderstand that and say well do you mean women don't have ideas that's outrageous did it is no but that has always been the truth women have a much more direct kind of sense of when someone's really aligned when someone's really grounded so men may test ideas but they may not be connected to any sort of deeper emotional truth and they can go off on all sorts of directions women in the past have been really good at kind of seeing where the alignment is and I think men are developing more emotional intelligence are more able to do that than before but I still think women have a deeper lived biological reality of really really seeing that deeper alignment and that's why the me to discussion again that's why it's really interesting because it shows these dynamics because what's been happening right now is that women have really really gone from him and really really testing and said speaking up challenging and what's happened is that men have kind of retreated to the corner gotten defensive or have really lost the masculinity given away their balls and what we're not seeing is that men are stepping up and saying okay enough but from a grounded perspective from a perspective of hearing and embracing the pain but also saying there's there's a limit because the feminine needs that that it's it's no fun if we keep running and running and and and nailing men per se on everything like creating a society where where where men are dangerous for women and this is what you know that's that's a danger for what's happening if we don't have a much more balanced conversation about this because as women we don't want all the power we want we want to share that space and and it seems like we both forgotten that we so we're so engaged in the antagonism in clearing the space that we forget why we're clearing it what one I'm gonna come back to what do we want to fill that space with what is the synthesis look like what does the what would a healthy relationship look like I love this question because this is the most open question we can have right now I don't have the answer this is what we're developing together right now this is why I want to say to my my sister's all the women are there come on let's do that let's find out what is it to be a woman because we've forgotten with Luke we've totally caught off from from those roots and let the men figure out what is it about to be a man and let's come together and see what happens in that space if we are all the same in post-modernism nothing is happening this is why we see our society isn't isn't a complete crisis this is only gonna get worse because we don't have we don't have a solution right now and this is why we need a co-creation a synthesis to go to the next level we can't go to the next level on our own the resources the the physical resources of the planet the mental resources our of our thinking they are exhausted they are not creating that next level that we need to go to and this is why for me this whole discussion between men and women between the feminine and the masculine these archetypes they are so essential because they are leading us to the next point of evolution so I don't have the answer what is that but I want to say let find out you
