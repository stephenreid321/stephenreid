[Music] the red pill was one of the most polarizing documentaries of recent years it showed self-described feminist cassie j going inside the men's rights movement in the US where she changes her mind about feminism the conversation is being silenced for a society to accept anything said on behalf of women's rights and then to shame any dialogue about men's rights and call it hate speech is precisely the problem I don't know where I'm headed but I know what I left behind I no longer call myself a feminist a word-of-mouth hit it also provoked protests some extremely critical reviews and was even banned from some cinemas in Australia so you brought out the red pill is it two years three years ago now yeah two tears and so there's one thing there's the film itself and I'd love to talk to you about that and your journey about making it and then there's another thing which is the reaction to the film why I'm really interested in that is that it shows a lot about the cultural moment that we're in when I watched the film as a filmmaker I I had a slight suspicion or just I wondered like how authentic the journey was because it was very like the narrative was was sort of very powerful you came in as a feminist and then work were sort of your mind was changed by the stories that you heard and you came out with a very different experience and I we interviewed Warren Farrell recently in in America and I sort of said that to him I was like well you know Cassie and how authentic was that journey and he said no it's completely authentic and told me a little bit about the backstory of what you were telling him as you were going through it so I'd love to hear more about that journey that you went through him making it I appreciate you being honest that you're skeptical of is this girl for real was she really a feminist and then sort of questioned her beliefs after talk men's rights activists and I think I would have had the same reaction if I didn't make the red pill movie and I watched it as a feminist I think I would have been very skeptical well first of all I don't know if I would have watched the red pill movie seeing how the media was talking about the film but yeah I definitely would have been skeptical because it is such a sensational idea for a story for a documentary and it's almost too strange to be true but yeah it was actually kind of a suicide mission for me where I had a hundred hours of footage after filming men's rights activist for a year and but working on the film for three and a half years and I I knew the journey that I went on was going to make me extremely vulnerable and open to critique and debate and and probably a lot of people would question you know Who am I and am I true and in my video diaries and and my interviews and all that and even men's rights activists were questioning me as a documentary filmmaker going in to interview them so really everyone was wondering is this chick for real so yeah I knew in making the film there was gonna be a lot of skepticism about me and I I just figured while I have to put it out there and whatever happens happens and I I say it was a suicide mission because if it completely flopped and failed knowing that I put the raw real journey out there then as well as having this stigma now against my name being a part of this highly controversial topic for a film I would have to go into hiding in it and I resolved that in my head as well I can just become a mother I'm already a hermit anyways I'm I'm a homebody so I was willing to take that risk and and luckily the film really resonated with a lot of people around the world so I'm I'm glad I took that risk could you describe that journey and what you went through what were your intentions going into it what happened during it and and where did you end up well my attentions going into it were I mean it talks a little bit about it in the film I was looking into the rape culture topic for a documentary and what really made me decide not to do a film about that was because it was so depressing when I started looking into the stories that I could cover and I I didn't know if I could put years of my mental headspace into that topic by when when I was trying to figure out the cause of the feminist view of rape culture I was pointed towards the men's rights movement and at the time a voice for men this online hub of men's rights activists was the largest and fasting fastest growing men's rights movement online and they were definitely the most controversial with Polly Elam being The provocateur of the movement and I thought well this is interesting and I I researched and found that no one had ever made a film on men's rights movement before it was fairly a young movement still so I thought I was gonna be the first and it was going to be a shocking piece and it would be a feminist going undercover into this misogynistic world and I would expose them for who they really are and and really that's what I thought the film was going to become and sure enough as I started interviewing men's rights activists I knew that that idea that I had of men's rights activist was not the truth of who they really were and what they cared about or why they were part of the men's rights movement and so then I had to put my own agenda aside and really start to listen to what they had to say and why they care about this movement and and ask myself is there still a story here and there were definitely moments while I was filming and editing I was wondering well who's gonna care about you know father's rights and suicide rates and male victims of domestic violence do we really have of all the issues in the world is this worth someone's two hours of their time to watch the documentary and the more I really started to dig into it I realized is a huge pervasive issue all throughout the world with gender relations and and what's happening for men opting out of marriage and you know the MiG town movement and feminism kind of dominating the the pop culture and the media and obviously I began to see that with the release of the film so I didn't know quite the extent until the film was released how much the average person's view of gender politics is really the the feminist ideology of gender politics so I and I think what really intrigued me was how when I started to realize how bias I was against men's issues and my knee-jerk reaction to wanting to dismiss them or victim blame male victims of domestic violence for instance I I realized that wow this is a lot deeper than that I thought I really do appreciate that you told me that you're skeptical of my journey making the film and whether or not it was a scripted plan for sensationalism and you know even if I never made the red pill movie and I just went on the journey of filming all these men's rights activists and questioning my own beliefs I I really do believe that I benefited from going going on that journey especially in my own relationship and also understanding my father figures and male friends better I think I could have been more private about my evolved views and maybe that would have saved me some stress over the past few years but because I chose to take my transformation public and show it and in this film it really kind of you know I guess I asked to be on the stage for stones to be thrown and I'm glad that I did it I hope I know that it helps a lot of people making this film and and but I don't think it's I don't think we're anywhere near where we need to be and I think the red pill movie was just a very early kind of icebreaker into these conversations but I think we have a long way to go with gender relations and and hopefully eventually finding a healthier relationship between the genders but mostly for children a lot of men's rights activists I'm hearing are becoming very anti marriage and kind of in the sense that McDowell is men going their own way our anti marriage a lot of men's rights activists are also moving in that direction because they believe the institution of marriage is so corrupt and divorce courts are so corrupt that they don't want to engage in all in it at all and the the danger and that is children because I I think we're men's rights activists don't are contradictory in their views as if they're anti marriage but they also stress the importance of present father figures father to child connection you need marriage to strengthen that relationship and men's rights activists have done a lot of work and even non men's rights activists have done a lot of work in showing the importance of present father figures and the danger of single mothers and I I would like to see marriage valued and and looked at from a scientific standpoint of building a healthy society rather than from a religious origin because I'm not religious and I wouldn't even call myself a traditionalist but I do think marriage is a very important part of the backbone of our society for children so I think we need a look in that direction helped to move in it in that direction you kind of had your focus on gender issues just before the me to movement started but in a way you took precisely the opposite perspective to to where the culture was going and I say yes I did yeah the me to movement really got traction a few months after the film's release so there was no way I could know that that was going to be the parallel media story along with the red pills release so that was interesting and I would have loved to have commented on that movement if I knew that was going to be coming your background I mean we talked a little bit before the cameras were rolling and you described herself as you live in California you're you're a liberal I mean can you sort of sketch out where you're from and and and what your personal sort of background is sure oh well I live in the San Francisco Bay Area sorry I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and I grew up in Seattle I went to high school in Las Vegas I lived in Los Angeles for about five years in the film industry pursuing acting at the time I never really made it I was a horrible actress but I did a lot of horror films in LA before moving up to the Bay Area to continue documentary filmmaking and I grew up fairly radical image a local Christian and now I consider myself agnostic but I left the church around my late teens around 20 and around that time as I was leaving the church I was also becoming a feminist and and that was when social media was kind of really taking off around 2000 5 6 7 and I think social media had a lot to do with me becoming a feminist just seeing those little info memes and getting sound bites of you know the pay gap which at the time I was eating up and believing and so I became an online feminist and and for about ten years I was a feminist before I started making the red pill movie and you at the end of the film you say you no longer consider yourself a feminist how what what did he mean by that and how would you describe what it means to say that well that that was definitely one of the biggest question marks in my whole journey making the film was do I keep the label feminists and try to work within the movement to make it more inclusive of men's issues because after learning about all these issues there's no way to then walk through the world ignoring that they exist I mean making the film and probably for viewers watching the film you can never see the world the same way again so I thought do I keep the title or the label feminist to try to work within the movement kind of like a christina hoff sommers the factual feminist and of course you know I've seen with her that it doesn't matter if she calls herself a feminist the the mainstream press will say what they wanted her and feminists will disown her and say you're not with us so I realized I'm just one person in my late 20s at the time I don't think I have the power to work with in a very giant highly funded movement to try to make it more inclusive immense issues and so I decided to drop the label feminist I [Music] think that's a good question why I mean I think I also I think I wanted to see how people would react I live in the Bay Area where all my friends and family consider themselves feminists and it's kind of a a given I mean the the idea is that if you're for gender equality then you're a feminist and it's you can't have one without the other and so that I knew that their labeling themselves feminists based on you know what they're reading and mostly liberal publications and and so I thought well if I make the red pill movie and I share with them because really in a one dinner conversation I cannot explain to them the journey I went on so hopefully I can make a film to at least be an icebreaker to these conversations and it did open a lot of their eyes and minds to considering men's issues but still many of them remained feminists identifying but some of them have gone on their own kind of rabbit little journey after watching the film and and started to see some of the male bashing by feminist scholars or educators or the media and started to question well is feminism really the movement the one and only movement for gender equality and you know personally for me I would want to be a part of a movement for gender equality that includes men and boys in in the discussion and I think the first step is to raising awareness about these issues which feminism is not doing so I dropped the label feminists I'm not a men's rights activists at all I understand their movement and sympathize with their cause I think what they're doing is valuable today I don't know I I hope it won't be necessary 15 20 50 years from now but right now I think it is necessary to have this counterbalance in the gender political discussion but I'm not a men's rights activist and what was the reaction among your friends and kind of your immediate circle did you have any pushback or did he lose any friends I lost some friends and in a fade out kind of way where they they heard about the red pill or they saw many imprinted and didn't like what they read and thought that I'd become some crazy right winger or something which I'm not I'm still a registered Democrat and and I can it hurt myself a liberal but I've been printed alongside its white supremacist nationalists and you know if I read that about some one of my friends a few years ago back when I was a feminist I would have been alarmed too and thought well someone went off the deep end went crazy you know put him in a padded room and I think that's what many of my friends thought happened to me when we spoke to Warren Farrell in America recently he said that you came to him and said oh are people gonna turn against me and he said yes they are and at the time you were like I was looking for some reassurance and you're you're not giving it to me yeah I mean a lot of the men so it's activists and I don't think Warren Federal Ferrell considers himself a men's rights activists but but a lot of the people I talk to during making the red pill movie did warn me that I would be career suicide that I would lose friends and colleagues and and at the time I thought they were being overly dramatic and I I just thought the whole movement was had all these conspiracies that were unrealistic and maybe wanting to you know get thing on their movement riled up to excite people or feel like they were part of some underground secret society and so I really kind of brushed it off and didn't think much of it but sure enough years later a lot of their premonitions were correct what what do you make of the media response because I sort of looked online and quite a few that there's some really harsh criticisms of the film sort of especially from some of those sort of more maybe millennial outfits like Vox and Vice and all of those people that maybe put some quotes and on-screen here but what did he make of that response I mean it was really hard at the time you know I'm I take a lot of things you know personally I'm a fairly sensitive person and you know emotional at times and so whenever an article is published that's scathing of me or the film based on misinformation it's infuriating to me because I it's obvious they didn't do their due diligence as us to really research and and I know the how the snowball started and and then saw it rolling down the hill and it started with our very first review of the red pill movie in the Village Voice based on radical feminist bloggers blog and the misinformation he posted about me and the men's rights movement and so that is what had everything spiral out of control and how the the red pill was publicized and all the petitions against the film and the justifications for banning the film in Australia and Canada were all based on these lies and it just made me lose a lot of faith in the media and also you know social media and the power and and danger of groupthink and thought police and and I and I also acknowledged that I used to be a part of that and how easily I could have fallen into that had I never made this film myself and I don't know if anyone else would have made the film I would like to think someone out there is gonna be making more films about these topics because I think they need to be talked about but if I never made the red pill movie I would have been right alongside those other feminists trying to ban this film and based on misinformation whether any of the criticisms of the film that you think were justified hmm that's a very good question of course the you know my argument is time constraints is very you know there's only so much you can do with what I was aiming for hour and a half long film became 2 hours so I was already stretching it kind of long but there's never enough time to include everything and and one of I think one criticism that I would give credit to is how the red pill movie portrays feminism and it wasn't a you know malicious intentional effort to you know make feminism look any kind of way I actually think I have far more rational and level had a feminist but most people going to the movie theater to watch the red pill only remember big red with the bright red hair and so they think that's the only discussion of feminism is her as the as the the front of the movement and I didn't see it that way I think she's just very memorable but I don't think that's the you know of all the content included in the film there's a lot of other scholars that are feminists that talk about their views on the men's rights movement and feminism but I also didn't see the need to have a whole history lesson on feminism because there are for my one red pill movie documentary there's a thousand or more feminist documentaries that you can watch on the same online platforms so to take up - to take up time from the one and only documentary on the men's rights movement to date to take time out of that to discuss the history of feminism I I think would have been stolen time so the criticism was that it was a caricature of feminism because it was mainly through this character at big red is that yeah there was criticism that feminism moment wasn't portrayed in a positive light that that more level-headed feminists would have liked to see but you know we did have the executive editor of news magazine who's certainly very powerful in there and the feminist majority foundation and and in universities nationwide Michael Kimmel is very influential feminist author Michael Messner is a gender studies professor i USC and you know I had feminist friends included in the film so protesters as well of course the big red hat to be in there because she was the only feminist that had a run-in with men's rights activists face to face and so it was a kind of a historical milestone for the men's rights movement to have this one and only interaction between feminists and men's rights activists at an event so I had to be included and I was lucky enough to get an interview with her so you know I also got criticism for including Paul Elam in the film which if I didn't include Paul Elam in the film I would see that as a Aled criticism because he's the most known men's rights activists at least at the time when I was filming and why wouldn't you go to the source of all the controversy and so there there's even student groups who have screened the red pill movie and then have been banned from pride parades and participating and other events just because they screen the red pill movie which had Paul Elam in it so it wasn't the movie itself that was the problem but the fact that Paul Elam was in the film was the problem so there's just no way to win is the thing on you know I maybe eventually there will be a sequel who knows or another filmmaker I hope will be interested in tackling the men's rights movement and they can do their own treatment of how they lay the issues out there or the members but you know it's good to critique films though because that's that's what you wanted as a filmmaker is conversation do you think with with Pauly Lam you could have been a little bit more hard on him I mean my sense watching the film was that as you just said before you're not really a confrontational kind of person and I'm a journalist so I'm kind of used to kind of confrontational style of interviewing not that I particularly enjoy doing it that way myself but like I did come away thinking you didn't maybe ask some hard questions - Pauly Lam but it that but I got the sense that was your interviewing style you didn't really ask but you didn't really put anyone on the spot on either side and I but I guess that was and I know now that you weren't even sure like why you were gathering the interview you haven't really made up your mind about what you thought about any of them you were still in that process well I think it's good to distinguish between a Barbara Walters type interview and a documentary and my history and documentary filmmaking has actually been flying the wall and so rarely if ever my my voice has ever heard in the film so the red pill was the first film I ever included myself in the film at all in including as narrator and also asking a few questions but very few questions that I asked my interview subjects were included in the final film itself so for people who criticize that I didn't ask harder-hitting questions to Paul Elam or to feminists or to big red eyed you know all the questions that I did ask them in my two to five hour long interviews work cut out except for maybe one question so to criticize the questions I asked is you know a hundred questions I asked them ones shown in the film I think you have to acknowledge the format of a documentary especially when it's more fly-on-the-wall but you know it's I did release a lot of the raw footage of the red pill movie so I really stood on YouTube for free for people to watch to see if I edit in anything out of context or try to manipulate the way someone was portrayed and I think that really helped in showing that I did not have creative manipulation in my editing style so if anyone is wondering if I was hard-hitting enough to appalled a limb or anyone else they can watch the raw files so yeah but as far as being more confrontational I think I was really confrontational in the raw files that's just a matter of if it made it into the final film because of all the that the people in the film the one that the people do keep coming back to his Paul Elin and there are some things that he said like I find really difficult online like I've got a lot of sympathy with with with the men's rights perspective that it is something that's not really seen or part of the conversation but when I see him saying things like I would definitely let off and I would never find someone guilty in a rape trial for example I just think this is kind of difficult to defend yeah and you know I could have I could have gone through all the cherry-pick comments that are used to against Paul Elam and a voice for men and I think that would be a film I wouldn't want to watch because it'd be really boring it I think it's a valid piece to put on on people are really interested although I think that people who need to hear it wouldn't sit through two hours of just listening to rebuttals that the cherry-pick comments because the context of what's Paul what Paul is saying about if you were on a rape trial he would vote to acquit the the male that's accused no matter the evidence presented that entire article that he wrote what was really interesting food for thought and I do recommend anyone who you know thinks that's a horrible comment read the entire article and and no doubt he's you know angry and in the way he's explaining his point and he's reacting from that anger and also trying to incite anger in the reader but you know I think the the criticisms of Paul whenever I watched feminist documentaries I don't see those criticisms of well what about when Gloria Steinem said this in 1995 or what about when Hillary Clinton said this in 1992 you know that the media doesn't take the same kind of just what's the word I'm looking for there they're not as thorough in looking at every comment that they've said that could be taken offensively and asking the filmmaker why didn't you say when Hillary Clinton said that the biggest victims of war are women and children who lose their husbands and sons you know that that does sound like a horrible soundbite and maybe that should be looked at in feminist documentaries so you know and then the the fish in bicycle comment by Gloria Steinem was quoting someone else but she repeated it so you know that there was a hashtag kill all men on Twitter that was going around and being supported by feminist scholars and universities you know so I didn't bring up those in the red pill documentary and because if we if we just want to sound cherry-pick sound bites and analyze those we could have a ten hour that I think would be hard to sit through so I tried to make it more about the ideas and the issues and an interesting journey for the audience to go on and there is also this paradox of you being criticized by male journalists as a betrayal of of women which I've seen a few of my female friends who have a slightly different take on feminism are often accused by by men of letting themselves into either internalized misogyny or some kind of yeah this weird paradox of okay so as a man you are devaluing my experience as a woman by telling me that I'm that I've got the wrong views and it's that's this sort of weird paradox catch-22 that it seems that okay are you not doing exactly the thing that you're accusing me of doing by invalidating my experience as a woman yes yes I don't think I could put it better than that exactly yeah and you know I I have had a lot of you know experiences as a woman that I felt I was mistreated as a woman and that's why I became a feminist you know now 15 years ago so I you know a lot of feminists who would like to criticize me saying that I I've been in this bubble where I've only looked at the men's rights movement and I didn't look closely enough at feminism but I did I mean I was a feminist and never heard about the men's rights movement for ten years and that was the real iterator I read and the blog's I read but even the experiences I had before coming the coming of feminists I I know the struggles that women face absolutely you know more more than I think a lot of people would realize because I you know do try to maintain a level of privacy so yeah I mean for any male journalist to think that I I am betraying all women and that I am engaging and wrong think and and not you know believing women's stories or hey I don't no I yeah I I don't even know how to respond to people like that because um yeah I've looked through a lot so and do you ever ask yourself that question have I internalized misogyny how am i letting letting my sisters down any of that hmm I let my sisters down well one of the one of the hardest parts about releasing the film was I felt a loss of sisterhood and you know I'm not a men's rights activist and of the women I've met in the men's rights movement I don't feel like I'm a part of a sisterhood so I haven't found this sisterhood since taking away the label feminists from myself I I don't feel like I fit into any kind of sisterhood group now you know I met some women and a lot of them would call themselves egalitarian or equalist or humanists and I think I am close to the way they think but but there's not the same kind of camaraderie that I experienced in feminism and I don't think I let the sisterhood down because I think there are plenty of people who are fighting for valid women's rights you know sex trafficking and maternity leaves and you know a lot of issues that I do want to see address and people are talking about them and having conferences for them so I know that work is being done and I'm not preventing that work from being done but you know I think in the way that I am helping the sisterhood is possibly in relationships I think the women who have watched the red pill movie who were self identifying feminists have really benefited from opening their eyes to men's issues and seeing their own male relationships in new light and so you know I think I have done a lot for women another criticism that people have of the film is sort of why are you showing all of these angry guys you know that's why a lot of feminists become as they've had some personal experience that enrages them and possibly rightfully so you know there's I think when people are really involved in gender politics or a movement on any side of the fence usually it's it's coming from a very personal place maybe even a place that it's too hard for them to talk about and discuss so all you're seeing is the the bubbles on the surface of what's boiling underneath and you know I think to write off activists as just angry whiners or you know crybabies or ferment so it's activists that they need a man up or something like that you know it actually just kind of justifies what or it validates and supports what they're saying is that we we do have this resistance to having compassion for men and men's issues and you know even right now the men's rights movement is debating whether they should take men's rights out of their title and because it's been smeared so much in the media that there and the hearing men's rights makes people scoff and laugh and and so they're wondering should we rebrand it as a gender equality movement or something like that and I think that's very telling as well that just even having the word men in a men's group or a men's forum or any any kind of organization with the word men in it is already at a disadvantage and is open to you know being fired at and so you know I think that's worth looking into and thinking about that why why is our society so willing to make money mend the butt of all jokes and that's acceptable and you know for truly for gender equality shouldn't we care about all genders the me2 moment happened very soon after releasing the film what did you personally make of that oh well the me to movement did you post me too we know I didn't I think I think it's good that the movement started if it helps a lot of women open up about their their story and and their issues and feel more accepted and embraced and speaking about those stories with their friends or family I think the danger of the movement is in the language and identifying only female victims and male perpetrators and when there have been people have come forward wanting to participate in the hashtag me to movement as a male victim or accusing a female perpetrator I think you know there's been a lot of disappointing you know reactions to that where they are not openly embraced and and given the same kind of treatment as a female victim with a male perpetrator is given so I think you know just discussing these issues is really important and I have you know sexual assault and harassment was definitely one of the issues that made me a feminist so I have a big soft spot for that issue and even my first documentary called daddy I do about sex education largely talked about sexual assault and abuse and rape and you know these horrible stories that I know have been going on far longer than the me to movement has come out so you know I know it's prevalent and it sort of increasingly feels like the culture at large is a kind of dysfunctional relationship between men and women like through the me to movement of times art movement so that certainly the Trump Hillary election just looked like it kind of yeah these gender dynamics were playing out on the wider stage so my my question is what does the space on the other side of that look like and in a way what I guess we talked about this is Warren Farrell and mine to be with him like what seems to be needed as a kind of one's like relationship counseling on a on a wife cultural scale like how do how do you resolve this debate do you have a sense of what the space on the other side of these this dynamic looks like I think the best way for me to explain my view on that is to bring it down to a very small experience which is my relationship with my now husband over about four weeks we've been together seven years and the last five years I've been working on the red pill movie so he's seen me through quite a transition what really worked for our relationship was the first two years of our relationship I was very much in the feminist mindset and I did and I'm not saying this is all feminists and I'm not trying to you know put down feminists by saying what kind of feminist I was but I did most of the talking and he did most the listening and my moods really set the stage for how home life was going to be so if I was happy as I say happy wife happy life that was pretty much the case I I did the complaining and he did the resolving and I had a lot to complain about and mostly it was housework and what I thought were roles put on me by the patriarchy expected gender roles of doing the dishes in the laundry and cleaning even though we're both working roughly the same amount hours I may work at eight-hour day and he would work on 11 or 12 hour a day but we get home and and it was I thought expected that I would have dinner ready in the house clean and I really resented that but he was also paying most of the bills because he did make more money and I saw that as another effect of the patriarchy and you know I did believe in the pay gap as being discrimination against women at the time I no longer believe that to be you know the short story of that but then I started making the red pill movie and a lot changed with that not only starting to hear men's issues and realizing all the ways that I have privilege as a woman a white woman in today's society but also seeing all the ways that men really are disadvantaged how would you explain that that you the privilege that you have as a white woman cuz that what some people won't understand what you mean by that or will react against it I well certainly if we had children I have I would have a lot of advantages there especially if you were going through a divorce but also social reactions if I were to take my kids to the playground alone there's no real question about you know me being on my phone or taking photos of them and walking along with them but if a man were to take his kids to the to the park and be taking photos of them on his phone there could be and there have been police called on fathers doing that let's say yeah in the dating world there's a lot of advantages you know I mean Warren throw maybe talk to you a bit about that but that men still have the risk of approaching and hitting on women for the potential of a date whereas women are I have to say yes or no and get that privilege and and I when I started to think would I rather be in the position of having to approach someone for a potential relationship versus be approached I would rather be approached and and it does feel like the power position to just say yes or no I mean if you're a royalty that would be the position you're sitting in not trying to plead your case and show your resume so I started to see that meant that I really do have a lot of issues that I never thought about before whether their rights or just societal and expectations on them obviously masculinity is is a really great for a lot of people where they don't know what is good masculine anymore we hear toxic put next to the word masculine any more than we hear good put next to masculinity or or positive masculinity so I think guys have a really hard time right now and and even if I'm you know in a work space and I'm the only woman out of you know ten people I I do feel that power of that my voice is the female voice in the room and you know I even making this film the red pill movie I was probably heard and listened to more because I was a woman making this film rather than a white man trying to make it film about men's rights so you know that's the culture that we're living in today and and I'm grateful that you know my voice as a woman is valued and heard certainly and but yeah I do see a lot of issues that men are facing so so when I started to understand the issues men face and apply it to my own relationship I I started to wonder what my at the time boyfriend was going through with maybe sleeping five hours and I working 11 or 12 hours a day in a laborious job and paying the majority of the bills and having that responsibility that if we can't make rent it's really on his shoulders to figure that out so after making a red pill movie it was the first time in my life that I switched gender roles with him and not consciously and not intentionally but it just turned out that I had a lot more to do for work and I was it made more sense for him to help me with my work than for him to work harder and we support him going to work so we focused on my work and he became the the homemaker type of gender role where he would take care of the and do the cleaning in the laundry and dishes and I noticed a lot of things that I hadn't seen before such as I wouldn't notice when he did those kind of tasks around the house and he would start saying did you see I did the dishes and I'd look around the kitchen like oh yeah oh thanks okay but the whole day I was focused on paying bills and getting the finances in order and it was really stressful and I I realized how much I hated being the provider I realized how hard it was to be the breadwinner and how stressful was and you know you are thinking months ahead and what is the financial plan whereas you know back when I didn't have to worry about the finances I was feeling underappreciated for for cooking the dinners but you know going to into both roles now I see that that both really have a lot to be stressed about and worried about and and both really just want to be appreciated by the other and recognized for their contributions to the household so long story short I think moving forward for the genders and for relationships is really trying to understand how the other person is walking in their own shoes and what they're going through and the struggles they face and the stresses they have day-to-day and the contributions they do make and you know that's another thing is I've I now see so all the sacrifices that men make for our society whether it's the road work and the power lines or the soldiers you know I have family members in the military and and war makes me extremely uncomfortable so I usually just choose to never think about it but when I really do start to think about the way that they're putting their lives on the line for people they don't even know but a country they believe in it's really powerful and it you know when you really think about it you can't help but get teary-eyed because it's they are they are doing so much for our society and for their families and it's just you know it really saddens me that so many men do go unappreciated in and I hate that women went underappreciated when they were you know the 50s housewife but I think we've changed positively in a new direction for women and I would like to see that happen for men as well yeah I guess for me it's that a space needs to be opened up that we we do listen to each other that and what you were doing with that with the film was showing there is another side to this and this is the same journey I guess that Warren Farrell went on that he was a big player in the in the women's liberation movement in the 70s and then started at the same time setting up men's groups and saying and then the stories he heard and there kind of turned him on to realizing wow there are some stories that are not being heard men's issues with custody and wanted to be there for their children and not being allowed to be and all of these sort of things and but it was when he was trying to bring those stories into into the what was then the women's moving the same look there are these stories they're not being heard as well suddenly they weren't interested he was sort of pushed out so I guess for me it's like in any dysfunctional relationship the only solution is to hear both sides of the story and have a dialogue between those two definitely and you know I think when I was a feminist the fear was that if you start giving credit to the men's rights movement or men's issues that somehow your issues are gonna be put on the back burner or that you're no longer gonna be cared about our funding is no longer even coming your way for resources and that that was a big fear of mine you know I think there is some debate about whether or not this is a zero-sum game a lot of people in the men's rights movement say it's not a zero-sum game compassion it's not a zero-sum game but then you can make the argument that there there is an allotted amount of finances towards you know any kind of social issue and if we are going to care and talk about men's issues and try to find ways to help them which may need a lot of funding where's that money going to come from so it's not an easy thing and I think there that's why there is so much resistance to the men's rights argument is fear over funding and and time to care about these issues and err time to talk about these issues and and also when you start realizing that men have so many issues of their own you can't really say it's it's one group an entirety that's oppressed by the other group now we're talking about we're all on this together we all have issues to care about if we're all if we all have issues is that going to just make them like there's a tie there is no game there is no race it's just a tie and now our are people not going to care about any of the issues because there's not an enemy with a victor I also as Paul Elam has shown that anger and polarization does drive people to to cover the issues and which is which is quite I guess disappointing in a way for me is that it does seem that it's a useful tactic to be able to drum up anger and response and reactivity yeah rather than creating a space for a genuine dialogue yeah and especially with social media and everything at the moment yeah and and the you know the best way to make a group organize and work together and have passion about their cause is to have a common enemy so if men's rights activists are not the enemy of feminists what is gonna be the enemy there needs to be something identified to keep that that machine running so maybe there is an an enemy that we can find that is that is preventing women from having equal rights and and I think that's the distinction that a lot of people need to look at when listening to feminist arguments is that equal rights or are they looking for ways women to have an advantage over men like in family court you know do we want shared custody or or feminist group really fighting for primary custody for the mother in all cases so if we're looking at equal rights and there's something preventing that from happening let's identify what is that thing but I don't think it's the men's rights movement preventing women from having equal rights you know as far as men's rights activist what's preventing men's rights activists from having equal rights you know and there's a lot of debate about could the word rights be used or is it just issues but there are rights that are being denied for men that women do have at least in the u.s. with genital integrity you know it is outlawed that a girl be circumcised but boys there is there is no limitation or restriction on that DNA testing should you as a person have the right to know that you are a father or that the child is in fact yours which are different story lines to know you have a child you know there are many women who get pregnant leave the state and never tell the father that he is in fact the father so should that be a right you know we've feminism never defined that as a right because they only looked at women's rights and that wasn't a part of the agenda but I would consider that a human right to know that you're a parent but only men have to deal with that problem so there are rights that are being tonight for men and who or what is preventing that from happening I think men's rights activists to do have a lot of valid points to make that feminism and the the mainstream view of gender politics is really the feminist ideology and they do have the most funding they do have you know a lot of people who become journalists or university professors are feminists are self identifying feminists or even self identifying radical feminists so those are positions of power in university in the media politicians so you know I think men's rights activists may have a valid point to make about that Cassie thank you very much thank you this film is part of a series from rebel wisdom on the subject of men and women including an interview with Warren Farrell we used to have a battle of the sexes that's been historical but now we no longer have a battle of the sexes we have a war in which only one side has shown up and with Hannah milling the creator of the viral film from women to men I am a woman [Music] who has been hurt by men I'm a woman who has hurt men who has heard men
