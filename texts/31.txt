[Music] Stanislav Grof is one of the world's most radical psychiatrists an expert on psychedelic therapy in the 1950s and 60s he conducted thousands of psychedelic sessions with patients he became convinced that these experiences of what he called none ordinary consciousness could create deep lasting transformations and also that these non-ordinary states often happen naturally but Western medicine had no framework for understanding them when the drugs were made illegal in the 1960s he developed holotropic breathwork a system of controlled breathing that creates similar experiences how do you summarize the worldview that you've come to well basically what emerged out of it was infinitely larger image of what the human psyche is what the dimensions are how far our consciousness can reach and then also the nature of consciousness and the relationship between consciousness and matter consciousness usually seen as a side product at the epiphenomenon something that comes out of the neurophysiological processes in the brain and if I should sum up what I have experienced myself over the years and what I have seen others experience I would end up somewhere in the realm of the great spiritual philosophies of the east probably somewhere between Hinduism and Buddhism you know I love the simplicity of Buddhism but I also loved a the archetypal world the mythological world of the of the Hindus and the richness but it would not be it would not be the Cartesian Newtonian worldview you know materialistic science I mean this that kind of worldview doesn't survive very much where we start doing this inner exploration because that's not the sort of language that's associated with science it's considered flaky or it's considered unscientific no it it can happen only in a culture that does not honor inner states of consciousness which is really primarily the industrial society since the scientific so a scientific revolution all the the ancient cultures all the pre-industrial cultures native cultures they all held non-ordinary states in great reverence they spent a lot of time developing very powerful and safe ways of accessing them and this became basis of their spiritual ritual life they were using these states for healing they were using these states for as a source of inspiration sort of artistic inspiration even for practical purposes you know finding lots objects or lots people or following the movement of the game of the animals that they were hunting and they had regular events or either groups or the whole tribe would actually go through and own ordinances of consciousness so their whole philosophy cosmology mythology was based on the experiences from these from these states now then what happened then in the industrial scientific revolution is that major discoveries were made that were turned into technological inventions being with the steam machine and so on and it started radically changing the world and then came kind of a hubris they came intoxication with what the what the reason can do I don't know if you are aware of the fact that for several years not a dime was not a dime in Paris was renamed the temple of Reason so suddenly the reason is he was something that the modern human humanity was very proud of and everything that was not rational was relegated into sort of an area that felt like embarrassing leftovers from the childhood of humanity primitive magical thinking and I think what happened here that the the baby was kind of thrown out was the bathwater because not everything that's not rational is irrational you see there also states which are translational the Mystics are not irrational they had experiences that are not normally available and they had to integrate the insights into their worldview they have no problems with everyday reality you know it doesn't take a lot of brain to function in everyday reality but they have something extra like when America was discovered you know Europeans had to expand their worldview they had to integrate the observations from this new territory the day before didn't know about and so something similar with the Mystics and we are now with transfers in psychology new paradigm we are recognizing what error that was to just dismiss that whole area and focus just on reason and I think we're paying a big big toll you know in terms of how we are destroying the world we lost really vital viable spirituality experience with spirituality hmm speaking from my personal perspective I've had I've done a lot of inner work a lot of meditations I've done psychedelics quite a lot when I was at university and on two occasions I've had what I experienced as incredibly deep spiritual states and when I was in that altered state it almost felt like I was making contact with other other consciousnesses or the collective unconscious surrounded by synchronicities and but I also found that a very difficult experience because in that state it became really difficult to tell the between meaningful synchronicities and ones that I was creating in my mind does that sound familiar as an experience well in my late wife Christina and myself we have done quite a bit of work with psychedelics and then we developed what we call holotropic breathwork were very powerful States very similar to psychedelics can be induced by something so simple as faster breathing evocative music certain kind of bodywork and a very very clear implication of that work was that current psychiatrist is painfully superficial painfully limited what is seen as the psyche is just barely scratches the surface the Freudian the postnatal biography and the individual unconscious no Freud was very proud and he was discovering the unconsciousness is what we thought the psyche was it's just the top of the iceberg or the tip of the iceberg and now the rest of the psyche is really hidden and this is what now psychoanalysis is discovering if you now would go to what happens in these non-ordinary states of consciousness you would have to change it and you would have to say anything that traditional psychoanalysis discoveries at the tip of the iceberg and there's an enormous part that remained hidden to classical psychoanalysis they were sort of some of the renegades you know Otto rank open it there is a record of birth and then young enormous opening into the collective unconscious both historical and and archetypal mythological so in these states whether they are induced by breathing by in psychedelics or whether it happens spontaneously they will take into this into these areas you can relive your birth you can relieve some kind of a trauma that you had already prenatally you can have experiences seem to be coming from other cultures other other centuries sometimes with a sense of really convincing personal remembering like the job we deserve a key is not the first time this is happening to me I once was that person and that can take you into the archetypal world we are meeting details from different cultures cultures that you have never studied this was great youngster I said and this could be this has a dark side and so there are demonic archetypes that you can encounter and they are very you know blissful incredibly ecstatic kind of states that can come everything had a much deeper meaning than what was actually going on there was a deep symbolic realm that I was tapping into and it was very hard to navigate but it felt incredibly like the most vivid experience I've ever had does that is that a familiar story yeah so the problem is really with psychiatry the psychiatry has a narrow non-functional model so our observations show that there's a significant subgroup of these non-ordinary states of consciousness that happen spontaneously which are actually healing attempts of the organisms that are crisis of spiritual opening and they're mistaken for for pathology because the experiences go way beyond the model the biographical model which is being being used so when a psychiatrist with traditional training too has to work with somebody who is in spiritual emergency somebody who is reaching into these other areas it's like you know a blind trying to lead somebody who is sort of seeing its problems you know with seeing through one eye or something like that does it sound like a spiritual emergency the one that I just described to you well we wrote we wrote of books about spiritual mergency one was our own book which was called the stormy search for the south and then the other one was a compendium we collected papers of other people who sort of presented different aspects of the same kind of idea beginning with the classical paper of Robert Assad Jolie crisis of spiritual open ink and then John parish work was a Jungian analyst who was working with so-called psychotic patients without tranquilizers allowing them to go through whatever they went through and using the Jungian maps to to process those experiences there were there were papers by Ramdas the former written Richard Alpert who did the early psychedelic researches was fired from from Harvard jack Kornfield a great leap asana Buddhist teachers and Armstrong it was a great psychic and she was describing the crisis that she was going through when her a real psychic gift was opening so that's called spiritual emergency and then Cristina 1980 started spiritual emergency network where we a collection of people who were capable of supporting these states in such a way that that approach use the healing the transformative I believe evolutionary and also heuristic potential HEU are when you work with these states you see an experience things that current psychiatry simply cannot explain the model is it's really too narrow too superficial but you believe these things are real that they are really existing a lot of these experiences are are subjectively real what do you think they are sometimes objectively real as well a lot of my effort was to actually show that many of them are what I would say ontologically real and it starts with birth were according to current psychiatry you're not supposed to remember anything from birth it's actually a strange strange belief that there is no consciousness in births or even in newborns as I don't know several months ago I think there was a article British scientists show that newborns can experience pain the next thing we'll hear scientists show that dogs can experience pain so the belief that there's no no consciousness no memory of anything that that precedes at the moment of birth and the reason that's given for this is that they the cortex of the newborn is not fully myelin asti the protective fetish sheets myelin sheets are not not completely finished now it's amazing the same argument is not used for the importance of Nursing something that happens immediately after birth suddenly unmanned eyes the brain can record subtleties of Nursing and the best impact on the whole life of the mother and the child child psychiatrists and obstetricians recognized even bonding which is the how important is the look into the eyes between the fetus and I mean the newborn and and the mother and at the same time denial the tears of any relevance what happens like during hours of potentially life-threatening situation adverse so this this work with holotropic states showed that there is a powerful record of births powerful record of the prenatal State and there is a powerful collective unconscious archetypal historical karmic and so on if I if I feel like if I had gone to a Western psychotherapist at the time or western psychiatrist in particular they would have I would have got a diagnosis of some sort but you see basically because we have that narrow model if you start having experiences that have to do with birth psycho-spiritual death rebirth and so on or or if you have experiences of some archetypal beings or even past life experiences the idea would be that some kind of pathological process stepped in and created these experiences that are not they are not sort of legitimate aspects of the human psyche they are sort of some kind of alien Enclave which is bizarre belief system I mean if anybody experienced what that looks like when you when you have archetypal experiences that would have been some pathological process as a beauty there's an artistry in that that the pathological process cannot create if your pathological process in the brain it's going to disturb your intellectual faculties it's going to it might cause this you know disorientation in time and space it will give you amnesia you will not remember some things but will not sort of make you experience Shiva Nataraja or take you to the Cimmerian underworld you know so this is just a very unconvincing thinking in psychiatry in it that we somehow board and we perpetuate it's not tenable anymore so you think it's a misdiagnosis that a lot of these people are misdiagnosed yes we don't have a category mystical experience spiritual experience so every experience of this kind would be seen as pathology of one kind of another and the approach is you know put people on tranquilizers or some other medication if it's intense hospitalized then put put diagnosis on them diagnosis which doesn't really mean anything this psychosis that where we can find something organic these are organic psychos those are medical problems and we can find something in on the x-rays or in the cerebral spinal fluid or in the blood and so on we can really make a medical diagnosis but there's a large category of these so called psychosis which we call endogenous or functional now if you know something about medicine you know what this means if somebody has epileptic seizures after a trauma we call it post-traumatic epilepsy if somebody starts having seizures and we don't find the reason we don't say we don't have a clue we give it a name idiopathic epilepsy or you know functional or whatever if you say endogenous psychosis it just doesn't mean anything it means that the person has experiences and behaviors that your model doesn't explain and that term literally means generated from within but we sort of present it's endogenous psychosis as if it was anything behind it it's a tautology yeah so this is just a large category of states that just because the current model doesn't include those experiences that are coming up then it's seen as product of pathology but there's really no medical documentation we don't find anything in the cerebrospinal fluid you don't find anything in in blood there's nothing to to support the idea that this is a real diagnosis if you have diagnosis in somatic medicine it means something you know you have to have something related to etiology why why this is happening it has reflection for what's called pathogenesis how that cause symptoms developed it has to have some kind of prognostic value and also guide you for some specific form of therapy if you have anemia you have to make a diagnosis what kind of anemia will it respond to iron ore it respond to vitamin b12 transfusions or whatever if you have infection you have to diagnose what kind of infection because different infections have to be treated differently if you say endogenous psychosis you know there anything from use like of in the past insulin comas electroshocks to people trying to do psychotherapy so it doesn't with the psychosis it doesn't really commit you to do any specific treatment when you have that experience that the most general framework is that the Western industrial civilization consider these things to be crazy so you don't have kind of any conceptual framework that would suggest that maybe this is something different you you know that the medical profession the scientists they know you know this is we have the the inflation of sort of a you know appreciation of anybody who was involved in in science like science got people to the moon and developed lasers and computers and if you come there the psychiatrist they think you have the same kind of you know accurate sort of solid understanding so you can have a paradigm that gets you to the moon and at the same time it's very lousy when it's applied to to psychiatry but there is a there's a magic about you you sit there as a representative of a profession that is supposed to know and they have a certain position about psychotics of the psychotic state so you know experts label you as crazy so who are you to challenge it even if you yourself seem there's some value in the okay so that's that's an important thing the other thing yes you even if it's germane content of the of the psyche it can get scary I mean there are the the archetypal beings which are very very scary dark sort of mythological beings or it takes you into the underworld and so on and you believe you can actually make contact with those in altered states yeah plus plus you know they're my sources of real fear I mean if you are reliving something that was the birth of 40 hours when you died in the birth canal and you had to be resuscitated there is a pocket of enormous anxiety so when it starts surfacing you know you will you will get very scared now another thing you can be you can connect to the prenatal state and there was heavy toxicity your mother or there even cases where the repeated attempts at abortion you know some some toxic substances being introduced into into the mother's body so if you hit if you hit that kind of memory you will probably paranoid like you wouldn't believe a lot of the so-called psychotic patients to deal with poisons they say their neighbor sort of is digging tunnels getting into their house somebody poisoned the food in there so they feel intoxicated they feel they feel poisoned and so on and then you know who is doing this they have no conceptual framework what is happening and so there's a tendency to project it that is you know what is the dangerous situation that it's coming from and so on so there are good reasons for paranoia if you want the other thing that can happen frequently that people start experiences what you called synchronicity the unbelievable sort of coincidences and they seem to be focusing on you and this is known in psychiatry but it's dismissed it's called delusion of reference we don't we know there are no meaningful coincidences related to you so you are making it up but anybody who studies these synchronicities who as the objective evidence has to say this is way beyond statistical probability I have I wrote a book when the impossible happens which is kind of biographical where I describe things that happen to me that I've seen that current science would consider absolutely absolutely impossible would could not happen in our universe and these unbelievable synchronicities are very much like that for somebody they can seem to be positive things are lining up that the universe is sort of you know caring about them and it's guiding them and sometimes it seems that the the coin set is a kind of closing closing in and you feel sort of surrounded and suddenly it starts making sense that you in some sense persecuted and so on this this is very similar my experience in those altered states is that the synchronicities come thick and fast and in a way stop being remarkable you you get used to the fact that the right person comes along at the right time or the right things happens at the right time but that in my experience can be very can be quite overwhelming and can be quite destabilizing because you can start seeing meaning maybe when there isn't like you get so used to coincidences that you take everything as a synchronicity when maybe it isn't it's quite easy to lose my experience it's very hot easy to lose one's bearings in that space well this is something this was the discovery of Jung who became aware of the fact that they are very very unusual coincidences that can happen in life and some of them seem to be just coincident it's in the external world but then he noticed there's different kind of coincidence where the connection is between an intra psychic phenomenon like a dream or a vision and something that's happened in what we call objective reality that if the psyche gets into a plane full interaction with the physical world that should not be happening in the Cartesian Newtonian well there should be the objective world and it is the psyche they should not sort of you know get into playful interaction and but it is exactly what is happening and so he was observing it actually for 20 years before he dared to present it to the scientific community because it violates that the basic principle in science which is linear causality everything should have a cause and and an effect and suddenly you find something that you cannot explain in terms of linear causality in in the horizontal sense and that in itself points to there being more going on that the consciousness itself has some interaction or creative power in itself well you see what happened is that he startled he was being you know surrounded by the kind of professional community obviously it was part of it him questioning his own sanity where these things were happening so yeah and was aware of what a bomb it is for the scientific community took 20 years collecting this is before he went out with it and actually he got tremendous support from Albert Einstein who visited had they had lunch and he told Einstein and I started carry on studied it because it is now emerging in modern physics I also got reinforcements from Vogue and Paul II who was somebody who was very much involved in the development of quantum physics and he was initially Young's patient and then they became became friends and he also encouraged him said this is now what's coming out from physics and so there are now experiments you know with welds theorem and the showing that the universe is basically non-local that that this distance is you know don't have that kind of absolute value that we attributed and I can synchronistic things can happen where things are connected over enormous distances and so on so this is now accepted in in modern physics so that whole concept of delusion of reference and so on has been transcended I have in the book when the impossible happens maybe one third of it is about amazing synchronicities that that happened and so you see if we had a psychiatry who describes this and it would become part of general knowledge and so on you would be in a better position when the synchronicities start happening you would know that this is a phenomenon the synchronicities increase when you are in a non-ordinary states of consciousness incident increases and so on you could still get scared but you would have something to you know to work with the other thing we would know that if somebody is in a state of this kind of activation of the unconscious the person needs special place not a psychiatric hospital a tranquilizer but be in a safe environment to people who know something about this ideally experienced it themselves and they can give them reassurance and say this is fine you know a very important part for example this latest experience of death River psycho-spiritual death rebirth when you might feel you're dying so you need somebody hold to hold your hand such this is not real dying just go this is this is part of a reverse process you imagine like the 60s where it was neither ourselves nor the young people who were experimenting at no Norwich where it's gonna take them you know that's a scary stuff here it was bad enough to discover new territories and you know and people were moving to new countries and they didn't know what they were finding this is much scarier you need maps you need some kind of understanding and you still make it's good but it helps and the kind of experience that that that I had for example do you think it's really important to integrate or to understand those I think it's enough if you if you draw the message of it which is that this is not just your ordinary nothing special material universe that is it this is a much more complex system were you know consciousness and and cosmic consciousness absolute consciousness plays a very significant role in it there is a script the hindus talk about Leela you know this is a cosmic movie it's not just something that happened by bouncing atoms you know it's not the universe that created itself by development of matter in it because I guess the message I get from your from your books and your work is not only are these experiences quite common but they are very profound and in some ways essential for us to develop to evolve to form a relationship with these experiences would you say that's a bit is very important in life yeah well somebody who spelled it you know obviously I tried but before me a young the idea was that we should live our life in such a way that you combine behaviors which are and approaches and strategies which are based on what we see in the external world but spend some significant time doing self self exploration examination and we would be tapping the wisdom which is in the collective unconscious and connect with what he called self which would be in capital its capital s in English but if the self is the big self different from the ego and so you connect with it and you find guidance from the inner intelligence and we are using this as basic principle in the work with holotropic states what I call holotropic states are States it's a very important subgroup of non-ordinary states that have this healing potential transformative potential evolutionary potential so when we work with these states the essential principle there is you mobilize inner healing self healing intelligence and this is what Jung was talking very much you know you it's not the analyst that goes and figures it all out and that's brilliant interpretations and so on that wouldn't work because we have any number of schools and each school will tell you something different about the same thing so there's no unanimity among schools of psychotherapy as to what are the most important motivating forces in the psyche why symptoms develop what they mean how you interpret them and each of those schools developed a different technique so if you have a problem in the current circumstances you can flip a coin you choose a school and with each school comes a different story but what's wrong with you what you should do so this basic principle with the whole topic status if the experts cannot reach agreement why don't you trust your own healing intelligence your body can do it why not the psyche your body can heal itself what comes through very clearly when almost every time I do a breath session is I I just know I can see where I'm going wrong in the world and what like I feel like I'm tapping into my the part of me that already knows what I'm supposed to do what my mission is what my what I need to do next and it just it feels like a download from a from somewhere else yeah now what we see if you get into this holotropic state which would be you know the psychedelic states working with breath but also in anthropology would be shamanic work the kind of experiences that the shamans have as part of the initiatory cry and that they use with their clients the kind of experiences that the initiates have in rites of passage in Aboriginal culture the kind of experiences that the initiates had in the ancient mysteries of death and rebirth in Egypt analysis in Sumer in in Mesoamerica and so on and then also what I call technologies of the sacred which were methods of inducing these states developed in the context of the great religions so let's say Christian mystics that things like essa cousin Jesus Prayer or the Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola they were using in monasteries fasting sleep deprivation you know extended prayers and so on in Sufism you have you have the whirling or you have various sort of chance the seeker because he caressed and so on you have you know Kabbalah and you have Taoist ik you have different forms of yoga different schools of Buddhism and so on those are all designed to induce these states that I call holotropic there they lead to spiritual opening they lead to healing transformation and so on so the work with holotropic States has very important implications it functions the state function as a radar which will find in your psyche and in your body where there are problems which would mean finds in your unconscious material which has strong emotional charge and which also is in a certain position to the threshold of consciousness is close so it's ready to emerge today for processing there are other things which are very important but they still bear it very deep they will it will take two sessions or three sessions before they make it to the position towards the threshold of consciousness that I are ready to come but you basically see this process as self-healing yeah and it is the opposite of what psychiatry is becoming more and more which is symptomatic control and it's it's confused with therapies called therapy it's basically suppression of symptoms that's not that's not therapy psychiatry historically developed a subspecialty of medicine so we tried to use medical thinking interest finding the right diagnosis which is very difficult with those conditions which are not biological in America we have now diagnostic Statistical Manual number five tremendous fights about what should go how what it should be written like and the clinicians basically constantly complain that they cannot match what they see in their patients so that concept of diagnosis simply does not apply to psychiatry unless these data are organic so we need really a very different you know very different approach to this this symptomatic treatment or limiting your approach to suppression of symptoms would be very bad medicine if you be you know don't ask why it is there and go to the causes to some ideological intervention it would be like a person coming to the hospital with fever and it's a fever and what are we gonna do put him on ice see no more temperatures you find this would be very lousy medicine I mean you miss some kind of infection that would kill the person or some other condition so in in medicine you use symptomatic suppression in two situations one is if you simultaneously do something causal you really try to go for the for the reason or if the if this currently is not known if we considered incurable then we can't do anything else but work with the symptoms so to do nothing else but suppress symptoms in psychiatry is like treating these conditions as if they were incurable this is nothing it's nothing else we can do but suppress the symptoms and it is very much supported economically of course by the pharmaceutical companies it says there is a deep connection between the psychiatric profession and the pharmaceutical companies and they you know they would not be interested in developing something like psychedelics something that you do once in a while do you want something like Librium valium you take four times a day for the next 20 years that's the interest of pharmaceutical company to help people a little but you know not not a whole lot and how important as a culture do you think it is for us to re-establish some kind of access or some kind of relationship with these kind of altered states well I think it's very important and you know all the ancient cultures all the pre-industrial native cultures they saw that this value in these northern estates and they spent a lot of time and energy developing safe and powerful ways of healing now we sort of poo-poo that we dismiss that when you know then we became rational we're scientists and so we have psychoanalysis or or behaviorism and so on when I had some psychedelic experiences and started working with patients and saw the power of it I apologized to the shamans what we think about this is these sort of you know savages just barely lit literally and they do some kind of mumbo-jumbo there I realize of the power of these medicines I would compare it to I was in psychoanalysis for seven years if I would compare what what's happening with those days with what happens in psychoanalysis or the behavior deconditioning it becomes like a joke I mean that's a real really powerful intervention in the psyche and if it's done properly I mean if you have a powerful tool you have to be careful how you're using it it's not something to play with you know it's amazing that there were not more casualties in places like Woodstock where half a million people they brought loads of it and we're ending it with both hands they didn't know what they were taking it's amazing that there were not more casualties I mean people been drinking there there would be more casualties and all this when I see people like people doing raves they would take something in the open square they they know they don't know what they are taking they they know they're doing something illegal the police can come you know that's not a great set and setting you don't expect healing sort of miracles happen under dr. Gupta's but I mean there is a way of using it responsibly where it becomes more powerful than anything we have available in psychiatry and I hope that we are returning to that real renaissance now after 40 years where it was practically impossible - this is a fantastic segue into the last question because I guess all of us who I've studied a lot I've read all of your books Richard tarnis Rupert Sheldrake people like that who are sketching out the problems with the worldview that we have and also sketching out a possible alternative and I guess we who are in this world feel like a transformation has to happen that there has to be a change the world view we have that's based on materialism and one based on consciousness has to take over and I guess every generation feels like they're on that cusp that there are at the moment when things will transform and you've been part of this world for quite a long time do you get a sense of how long that might take for a Copernican shift to happen again it you don't have to very be very bright to realize we are in trouble I mean this humanity is in trouble we are in a crisis and if we follow of that trajectory we might not make it I mean if you see the level of industrial pollution of the air of the water of the earth you know where biological creatures is nothing that we need more than clean water clean air and soil where we grow our food no you know no motives like economic profit ideological religious military concerns are more important than protecting the life because we are biological entities so it's insane you know to violate somehow the environment in which we are living we should have a constitution that protects environment and protects life you know something like violence should be outlawed should not be acceptable form of form of solving problems and people who do some significant inner work they get rid of their own bad programs which would be you know prenatal traumas trauma of birth whatever happened in their childhood and so on if you can clear this you start seeing it I mean it's it's not you know very complicated thing what this planet should look like we need to have renewable energy so that we don't plunder fossil resources you know limited limited for sale resources coal or petroleum and turn it into pollution this is a blind la I mean the weather is going to take 20 or 50 years or 100 years this is this if we do it this is going to be inhabitable planet yeah gonna wipe ourselves and take a lot of species with us there was a very interesting which was showing if these things really get bad what what was the species that was best equipped to survive they were the cockroaches and insect insect more than I think what hold house did Chronicle or something like that yes the question is we all feel do you think that a shift is is imminent or do you think you well you asked that question how long you know it's very difficult to say I believe that it's probably the only hope it's a humanity changes I mean violence and greed have been the driving forces through you know millennia and we are in a situation where we cannot afford it anymore I mean the weapons are too powerful now and we have overpopulation and and we have the the pollution happening so we have to change into something else or we are not going to make it terence mckenna's did you know that the history of the silly monkey is over we either change it to something else or we are not going to make it we have we have now powerful weapons chemical nuclear biological and then use it like with emotions that are like from the Stone Age only where they were using clubs stuff at stones they did do much damage and even after the big battles you know 50 years later nature would recycle everything and you could barely know that something was there now this one accident in Chernobyl you know this the radioactivity will be around for hundreds and hundreds of years I don't know strontium half time and 2,500 years or something so I feel since this is true insanity you know people who live hopeful yeah people who have past life experiences and spiritual experiences you know they are okay in this be the maniacs are those who are spinning these kinds of these kinds of scenarios you know nuclear confrontation and stuff like that so you're asking am i hopeful and moderately hopeful if it were just based on what we see I would probably be pretty you know pretty pessimistic but there seems to be things happening on some our other level like for example a lot of people are going through powerful transformation without it showing like what was showing in the 60s people painting their cars psychedelic colors and you know wearing long hair and beards so that very very easily identified identifiable as troublemakers you know they were the ones who were around the Capitol protesting against the Vietnam War and so on today the the transformation a lot of people are involved in transformation but it's time was much more skillful means as the Buddhists call it you know and I think it's our ultimately our only hope that the people change and and true spirituality comes into the planet we have lost genuine experiential spirituality we have religions but there are more of a problem than solution you know you have organized religions that that unite a certain group of people who are want to see think the same way and worship the same way but it also divides the world it's it's setting that group against another we are Christians and everybody should be a Christian so we convert you or there is no place for you you know we are Muslims you are infidels so let's wipe you out Jews you know you are you're going we Hindus you're 6 and so on and the differences are enough to kill not only between the Creed's but inside you have here examples you know what can conflict between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland you have you have the and this has been going on for centuries then you have Sunnis and Shias would be four different systems or the same creed they would be killing each other and destroying each other's temples Joseph Campbell used to say that a useful deity should be transparent for the transcendent which means it should be pointing to the ultimate but not being mistaken for the militant said if you make an archetype if you make a deity opaque you cannot see beyond that then you have basically idolatry and then you have the the danger that you divide the world because there will be people who would focus on that particular archetypal domain and would get into a hostile relationship so you need a situation where you get through the archetype to the source out of which everything comes and this is something that you find in mystical branches when the organized religions get into conflict and fights the Mystics they don't have any problem the mystical experiences are universal they are all-encompassing everybody is included they don't sort of alienate the world and so I think what I believe we need true spiritual revolution in which we would give people means to have personal experiences honored the spiritual quest but would not have any kind of investment in which form it ultimately takes that sort of it become you know truly global global religion rather than being dividing thank you so much
