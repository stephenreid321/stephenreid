[Music] so my name is Michael Robillard and I'm a philosopher at the University of Oxford and I focused mainly on the ethics of war so in a past life prior to my my time is a professional philosopher I was an officer in the United States military I was an officer with the 82nd airborne for five years roughly I spent eight months in Iraq in 2003 2004 as a light infantry platoon leader and I exited the military in 2007 and have been doing philosophy in some capacity ever since so at least for the last 10 years since I've been out and trying to reintegrate back into civilian society you know I've talked with a lot of other veteran friends from Iraq or Afghanistan trying to sort of make sense of what it is that we took part in and you know how to sort of fit back in and move past it and I came across a book called tribe by the war journalist Sebastian Junger and what Younger looked at was that there's since war - there's been a decline in in trigger time and a combat time for soldiers from World War two through Korea through Vietnam through the existing engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan and there's been an inverse relationship of reports of PTSD and and psychological illness in reported in soldiers so that seems rather counterintuitive and what I found younger CSIS was that when you're in a combat scenario and you're with a platoon and you're trusting one another with one another look one another's lives and you're in a context where you're you're living and sleeping right next to each other you're eating next to each other you're relying on one another for emotional support and what's outside that bubble and outside that perimeter is the threat of imminent danger that that essentially mimics what would otherwise be a tribe in a more earlier hunter-gatherer epoch and for the modern mind that would have probably been one of the closest instances ever of sort of experiencing that type of bonding so youngers thesis is that what's sort of making present returning veterans so disoriented it's not so much the amount of horror and traumas that they're being exposed to rather it's the sharp and jarring transition from being in this sort of Band of Brothers moment back into 21st century alienating society where we're amongst a rather thin and consumer based society people are very sort of atomic and individualistic in their social relationships and it ends up sort of being like the wolf that's lost its pack and in so doing people lose their sense of identity and their sense of meaning or purpose in relation to some sort of overarching group or overarching project and furthermore I would argue that I think it has bearing on a lot of the maybe groups of young men that are even older men that are feeling alienated in this sort of highly atomic post informational post-industrial society that we're in so not really sure what to do about that I don't think that we need something like war or combat or life or death scenarios in order to be some sort of surrogate or proxy just for men to find solidarity or meaning or purpose in fact I think that's I mean that that that's the very narrative that Isis and and a lot of extremist groups are tapping into I'm sort of puzzling through this myself and you know I'm hoping at least some people would step up and begin leading and trying to to put together these types of things these types of groups that that could express this sort of mail and energy and and sense of meaning and bonding in a way that could be productive and build social fabric in the absence of this I'm worried that's one of two things will happen either men will continue to be more sort of alienated and feeling without a place or that energy that could be co-opted by more pernicious groups with a lot worse agendas I would end by saying that the scenario that I've described or the state of affairs that are described I don't think it's endemic to soldiers I don't think it's just endemic to men I think it's endemic to really the post 21st century person and what we really need to look at is our conception of the individual not as some sort of atomic entity the cleaved from all culture cleaved from all history or cleave from all relations so I really understand the individual is still important withstanding as in relation to a context to a family to friends to a history to it sort of social set of relations as opposed to this sort of Cartesian atomic individual that is not grounded in anything bigger than itself that's all I get my name is David fuller I'm a journalist and I've recently started teaching men's work and this is a bit of a story about how I got into men's work what I got out of it and it's about masculinity it's about my relationship with my father it's a very personal story but I hope that it's also in some way Universal I've told it to people in the past it's sort of yeah it seems to connect with something quite deep in the experience of having a father and maybe not getting on so well with your father and then trying to rebuild that light that that relationship and in the later years of your life so we're going to pull back and start this story back in 2011 in Libya I used to be a foreign producer with channel 4 news Tripoli was falling Gaddafi was on the run we came into Tripoli just as Gaddafi's regime was crumbling so there's guns going off people firing their this is center of Tripoli just as everything's going so yeah then so shortly after that we got to get out Gaddafi's tent this is the burnt-out Gaddafi's tent in the center of Tripoli and around us all of these guns are going off people firing into the air it's just this incredible moment there's a few times in my journalistic career or I felt I'm in the middle of history this is just an extraordinary place an extraordinary experience and we had a satellite phone I thought I really want to share this so I called my parents called my mom and she answered the phone and I said listen listen to this just crazy crazy moment guns going off everywhere and she started crying and I said okay I'm not in danger and she then said I'm at the hospital with your dad he's just been diagnosed with stomach cancer and we don't know much but we know that stomach cancer is is a diagnosis of stomach cancer usually means it's pretty advanced and we think it's pretty bad and he he was young he was fit he'd just been on cycling holiday the literally just the week before and so it's completely unexpected completely out of the blue and I knew it wasn't good I started crying as well on the phone and my bosses at Channel 4 News thankfully just put me on a plane straight back to to the UK and so as we're in the plane going back to the UK I'm just going to take a little digression and fill in the gaps because growing up I didn't get on well with my father at all we always fought and we still didn't get on even in 2011 just before this happened and I to be honest I was I was a bit of a little shit to him growing up I used to kind of take the piss out of him I used to there was a sort of conspiracy with my mother against him and I was I I never worked this out worked out why for a long time but I was really nasty to him and I push him I push him I push it and I I remember one time I pushed him so much that he grabbed me by my throat and held me up against the wall and it didn't it didn't sort of dawn on me until later and there was kind of a real sense of euphoria when I got when that happened as well it never dawned on me until later why that had happened it took me quite a long time to work it out and a lot of it was through the kind of the men's work and the inner work that I'd done after that that I sort of started to make sense of it so my parents were very left-wing very idealistic my childhood was like CND marchers delivering leaflets for the Labour Party they were very rebellious as well and naturism now for about the next couple of minutes I'm gonna be speaking with a picture of my naked father behind me but it's what he would have wanted so my father was very much a kind of new man he wanted to be very different from the male role models that he had and he wanted to kind of yeah be non-competitive and be be someone different from from his father and what he'd seen growing up very non competitor when we were played when we played football me and my brother he'd say why do you have to have a goal I can't just pass it to each other and it took me a while but underneath he was he was really opinionated he was really stubborn he always thought he was right very different from me everybody knows he lies and he could also get really really angry and want his own way and I think that's what I was doing when I pushed him just sort of pushing that point like to say I know that that's not that that's not authentic that kind of non competitive edge there's something more there and I pushed him until he until he snapped until I found it and my mum told me later on that just that moment really traumatized him like him really it took him a long time to get over that that that I pushed him to that point that he grabbed me and that he realized that he had that in him and it took it took a lot a lot of sort of transformational work after that where I started to really unpack the the anger that I had towards my father and to really kind of understand it and and recognize that all the things that I disliked in him I I had it I had all of those things in myself and was really able to kind of understand the shadow of what what I was pushing out in him was something that I also had because my my experience of men's work is that I can speak for myself as a man I have those those edges I have that aggression I have that wanting to be right I have that wanting to dominate I have all of these things that can come out and my experience is it's only through fully recognizing those and integrating them that I've become more whole as a man to to do what you could call the shadow work of really kind of looking at myself really deeply and then taking that anger taking that aggression and using it integrating it into the personality and then becoming sort of more more present more powerful it becomes I think once integrated a form of sort of personal power and becomes a kind of fuel for certainly to become a kind of fuel for my life and over probably since about 2006 when I first started doing workshops and starting doing this work this sort of in a work from a place of crisis in myself that I started to really kind of integrate some of these things and on some level I started to heal at least some of the relationship with him in my although at this point we haven't kind of healed it in the in the outside world so planes now about to land in in the UK and I go straight down to Southampton to see my dad in the hospital and he's outside in the garden with my mom and a family friend and I just go up to him and I embrace him and for my friend after a few minutes my friend takes this picture which is one of the most precious things I have in my life I think how probably lasted for about 10 minutes it might have been even more sort of time stopped and my friend realized at some point that he was in the presence of something special and got his phone out and took this picture and something something I think very profound happened in that moment some kind of healing happens and I've had a few friends who've looked at this a friend of mine touched it up and has turned it into a picture I having my wall at home and there's something about the way he's kind of collapsing into me and I'm holding him that's a kind of a transfer of some kind of I don't know as a child taking something and taking it from my father that that from what then happened I feel that that's what happened in that moment and I think what happened here catalyzed a lot of what happened next because shortly after that he got the diagnosis and he was diagnosed with three months to live and that makes makes things real obviously and I I then wrote him a letter and I said I said look I've been doing all of this work I've done all these workshops and I get these reflections from people in these workshops what people say they talk about my authenticity or they talk about my honesty or and I realize these are your qualities I realized that I got them from you and I've never been able to admit that to you I've never been able to to recognize all the good that I got from you and he was very touched by that letter and then I thought well this is he's gonna be dead in three months why doesn't everyone I don't want to hear it's funeral stuff that people should have said to him before so I then got in touch with all of his friends all of the family everyone that used to work with as many people as I could and said he's gonna be dead in three months I want to hit I want you to what you might want to say at the funeral I want you to say it now and send it to him and so over the next three months as he was becoming more and more ill lying in bed my mum was reading these to him and all of this amazing stuff started coming in from former friends work colleagues family so he was an arts officer for the council and created the Southampton Film Festival save the Theatre Royal in Winchester created the street parties in the road and my father's like core wound was that he really didn't think he'd achieved very much in his life he he had a real down on himself and felt that he'd been a failure he'd never read a amounted to much and this this has really eaten away at him and then somehow in the last three months of his life some of that change some of that shift of just from the weight of all this stuff coming in and the sheer love an outpouring of stuff that came in and I write I'm sure that part of that was catalyzed by that one moment and that one healing I was able to do and then to be there for him and then to produce I turned him yeah I'm sure it was catalyzed by this by this moment and then I I made a I took all of those and made it into a book that I gave to him for his for his birthday sort of about three weeks before he died because there was also when when things like this happen there's there's a Jordan Peterson quote where he talks about be the person to rely on in a funeral it's hard enough in a funeral but it can be absolute hell if you haven't dealt with your family stuff and I really feel because all sorts of stuff came in some people are in denial some people are in don't want to know I mean other members of my family just wanted it to go away they weren't ready for I feel that I I was able to be there because of the work that I'd done and yeah it turned into a really beautiful experience rather than being absolute hell even though we were all there when he died we we were holding hands around his bed when he died and it was it was very yeah it was it was one of the most I now look back on it it's one of the most precious moments of my life and it's a it's a wonderful it's a it's a wonderful story and it's often I told this sort of over the last few years and this is normally where it ends and it's but it's not where it ends because as someone who had I believed my father's image of himself like I I treated him as this failure growing up I'd realized that I didn't turn alized the story that he hadn't treated him the same way to kind of treated himself and then to have all of this come on at the age of 36 to realize by the time he was my age he'd opened at Art Center he saved a theater he'd created the Southampton Film Festival he had three kids it's like oh this guy I thought was a failure at a chief farm or that that stage that I had and there's also something that in my experience when your father goes as a man that's there's something archetypal even though I didn't get on that well my father there's something there that's missing this sort of archetypal grounding point and I really found that I had to go on a journey of myself over the next sort of six months to really find my path and find what I needed to do and it was it then became like the hardest period of my life like I had some real ups and downs over the last six years just really trying to get my shit together and decide what it was that was meant to be doing with my life and what I was meant to be bringing into the world yeah it was pretty hard and yeah it's only in the last year I feel that I've really started to come out of that and realize what it is that I'm supposed to be doing and it's sort of its leading men's work use my journalistic skills to tell the stories of this kind of transformational work and then to lead the work because you can only you can't you can't show someone a film and give them a transformational experience you've got to give the transformational experience as well and this is the work that I'm most passionate about and this is what I found the most helpful in my in my personal journey and we consciously in our workshops we consciously bring in support of the father it's a very kind of emotional piece for a lot of men to to feel that to model some up some healthy father energy in that workshop space and we had a guy a father and our last workshop who said he he really wanted to go away and give that to his son so I you know as always writing this yesterday kind of I wish that my father had had some of this and maybe the relationship that I have with him would have been a bit different but he did the best he could and I'm really grateful for that and I just want to yea honor him by raising a toast to Michael - Michael it's not representing the organization a band of brothers we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition Shakespeare's Henry v and that's the inspiration for for the name of our charity that started about a decade ago and we were sat in a loft and there was a group of us about sort of seventeen eighteen of us and we'd all been doing the type of men's work that David was describing that process of really looking at Who am I what should I do with my life and it is there any meaning and purpose and we've been doing this work for about four or five years and we felt a huge amount better about ourselves but as we sat there in that loft in Hove we realized that if if there is a crisis in masculinity it wasn't really amongst us because we were pretty white pretty middle-class and pretty privileged and that maybe just maybe if we were to set about trying to do something to address some problems that we saw in society where we should be focusing our efforts was in the council estates where we knew that young men were leaving care going into the prison system getting locked up returning from the prison system more damaged and fucked up than they were when they went in and what would it be like for us to set ourselves the challenge of reaching out a hand to them going back to the ancient ancient traditions of the older men in a society believing it to be their responsibility their sacred charge to initiate the younger men to say to the younger men this is how we do stuff around here this is what we expect from you and in return this is what you can expect from us it's not a one-way street being a man in this tribe and we believed that that that that social contract that bond had been lost and what would it be like if we try to recreate that so that was ten years ago and what I'm going to do now is show you and allow you to hear the voices of some of the young men and some of the volunteers that we've worked with over the past decade and then I'm going to return and talk a bit about what we've learned in the ten years that we've been doing this work well if you think about communities in the safety of communities they're most sort of at risk through unsocialized young men I remember seeing my dad going down the road from his house when he had passed and I was there and I'm bogged down about it I got put in the cell and I said I'll never do it again then I got done it again and I ended up back in the cell I don't work at a to become man it's just one of them things we as a community of men recognized that all of us are wounded all of us have our own issues all of us are struggling to answer the big questions of life of Who am I really what should I do with my life and is there really any meaning or purpose and we engage in those questions with the young men but I'm living the new life that I always wanted to live [Applause] so what we do is we take young men referrals from the Probation Service and we approach them and we offer them the call to adventure do you want to come and see what what maybe is behind and driving what what what what your life looks like and those young men have often never had an invitation quite like that we take them away to the woods we take them off to the woods we take them away from their known world and surrounding those 10 or 12 men on those rites of passage weekends are twenty five grown men from their community we set out with a belief and a hypothesis that what the young men were looking for was meaning purpose and belonging meaning purpose and belonging and that was certainly borne out and for too many men in this country there is an absence of meaning purpose and belonging what we didn't realize when we started doing this was how much our older male volunteers were also in desperately in need of meaning purpose and belonging and that bringing those two groups together has been deeply deeply healing because instinctively I felt scared of young men I still notice it come up in me occasionally even now even after doing this work for years and years I walk past a group of males in hoodies at a bus bus stop and part of me will feel scared and yet now chances are I might know one of them another thing that we're we're seeing is that one of the jewels spoke earlier about the stiff upper lip the kind of the traditions of the upper-class Englishmen that started perhaps with that sentiment of the definition of a boor is an Englishman who when you ask him how he is he actually tells you so that there's that kind of thing that and that we heard about that boarding school of environment of never showing any fear and you know what it's the same for the young men growing up on the council estates going to the going to prisons like being in those environments they are not the only emotion that they can show is anger grief and sadness no fear no like love and joy no so their emotional range a lot of the emotional range of men and young men gets channeled into a very very narrow funnel so we see that the work that we're doing in allowing men and young men to improve their emotional literacy to express the grief the sadness the shame that fear that might have been inside them for years without finding ground we believe is really really important the other thing that we're finding is that men need community and I used to say to funders and people that came down to see our work I used to tell them that this is my community this isn't just a youth project this is my community these men in this community will bury me when I go and that was always a kind of it was a it was a construct but last year what happened is that one of those men that was sat in that room with us in Hove ten years ago died I'll bring his name here tonight Peter and Peter died and we as a community held held that process held his you know the young men the young man that he first mentored went up to the woodland burial site and was part of a group of men digging the grave that would hold that man telling stories of what they remembered and what they celebrated about Peter Wow that sent ripples right through our community knowing that that's how we look after each other that's how we look after our own so whilst we're creating social good we're also getting a huge amount of value for ourselves and that for me is what what service really looks like and I'll leave you there thank you very much what's the value of having groups of just men because some of what you're talking about is kind of sharing and vulnerability in that that can happen in different kinds of groups can it so what is the value of doing it with just men there's two parts to it really one is that what will happen in in Akko gender group is that as a heterosexual man I will start to try and establish some rank because I'll be aware of aware of which of the women that I want to sleep with and I want to look good and that will mean that I'm showing up in a different way too if I wasn't doing that and I feel quite embarrassed admitting to this but that's how it works and there's also something that's a bit kind of subtler than that which is that what I do Co gender work I think there is absolutely a place for doing Co gender work especially in the times of me - I believe there is a massive need for men and women to hear each other's stories going beyond the stereotypes beyond all of the kind of stuff I think there's absolute you need for that and what can sometimes happen in Co gender groups is that I will expect unconsciously the men will expect the women in the group to do the stereotypically feminine emotions so the men will expect the women to hold the vulnerability the sadness the grief and and and it can become polarizing whereas when it's an all-male group we find ourselves manifesting and experiencing those emotions demonstrating them modeling for the young men that we can be in an authentic space of masculinity and in those emotions and you know at the weekend we do all of that stuff that's traditionally seen as in our polarized gendered society is being feminine so we cook and we clean and we look after the young men and we'd clear their plates and we do all of that stuff because they've often never experienced being nurtured by by other men and often they don't don't see they don't honor that part within themselves so that's kind of why we why we do it as a single gender groups yeah it's a really good question and I would say there's a couple of things I completely agree with with Nathan that when a woman enters the room men's behavior changes it's just it's just something that happens on a very subtle level and performance comes in or whatever it's a there's an element of inauthenticity that can come in very easily but also I think there is something that we can give to each other as men that that really feeds us on a on a deep level someone's called it the vitamin M that we're all craving for on some level and I've this is a really bodily ID I think you probably agree there's a bodily experience of some kind of sustenance that comes in I'm sure is related to kind of this deep evolutionary history of being around men and doing things together with men and it's a real felt sense it's like you don't know that you're missing this but you are and and that that really comes in I think in that in that space it's like I'm on a much deeper level we knew when we started doing this well we had a suspicion that the young men would really value an older man blessing them looking them in the eyes and going what I see in you young man is a fine soul somebody who really cares about those around them has somebody who this you know so it's a really blessing them and we were absolutely spot on in that and that means a huge amount to the young men what we didn't realize was how much we as older men were craving the blessing of the younger men for them to say to us chi noir nobody's ever cared about me and you lot have thank you it was just like wow like that that just meant so much and and and and we didn't see that coming I would certainly very much like to hear from some of the women in the room about what their feelings are listening to some of the stories that have been shared or yeah some of the experiences or what what's come up for them in terms of hearing some of the things that been shared tonight I would like to say that I have really appreciated that you guys don't have a front today I really feel that what you have said has come from you personally and I think that is what a lot of women are missing out on frankly when they're talking to men in talk to a boss talk to colleague we don't try and see behind your fronts and I really appreciate today that you guys have been personal and honest and you've trusted that people have listened to you without judgment and I think that's I really appreciate that as a woman listening to this to you guys today and the reason why I came here today is to see whether whether or not there's anything women can do to support men to help them have a more positive healthier kind of version of masculinity or whether we should just like step back do you know what I mean so I wanted to hear from men and I guess I would like to hear maybe from you guys what you think on that what met what women can do to support this I suppose I mean what I'd say for myself is that through really connecting to my masculinity and the work has really enabled me to connect with the women in my life I mean the kind of the terminology is to connect with the feminine like connection to my Maskin has allowed me really to connect with the feminine and I feel that's in myself as well as outside it's it's rooting myself really into my masculine has really allowed me to connect with my own in a feminine and then with with the women in my life so that but I think there is something that we have to do for ourselves yeah in terms of kind of growing out of my toxic model of masculinity of my early 20s the friendship of women was so crucial to that I mean I would say even now I probably got more close female friends the male because it was just easier to have authentic you know conversations with them but I think that David's right that it can't be just that I mean I think I still have issues around trusting men and and opening up with men and so there is I I kind of been converted by these guys to the idea there is there is some good work to be done you know with I'd have never been to a men's group but I mean I'm more open to the idea yeah this that there is that there is a kind of healing in terms of trusting other men as well I made a really bad mistake which was a female friend of mine and I were talking about the me to stuff and she said to me you men all have a problem you need to sort this out and I was just like huh you wouldn't approach a person of Muslim faith and say do you Muslims have got a real problem with like you know kind of extremism in your community you all need to sort it out so what why do you think that all men are responsible for the actions of extremists like Harvey Weinstein within our community that's not to say that we don't have issues around sex and stuff that we need to work through but there is something in that because what I missed in that was the opportunity to say to her because what she went on to disclose was the actually she being a sexually assaulted when she was younger and that still carried a lot of stuff around it and because of how the conversation had gone I didn't get to say to her I that was wrong and I'm sorry that that happened and I didn't get to grieve with her for what was lost in the moment because I was too in my own reaction around like all of you men and carrying the burden and the shame of all of that collective stuff so yeah that would be the other thing I've turned a more serious no to you know for all of us as human beings to look when we're generalizing and one we're giving somebody stuff that isn't theirs - one yep essentially one for you David and I was really moved by your story and I was wondering if you have any ideas or thoughts about how that sort of approach Minh or how that changing that relation can happen before before it gets at that stage as it were and because I think many people would rather it is often left to that that lateness isn't it and that actually you won't see it before now I have tried to do this my own father had that sort of deep in musical conversation I think you just found it bit awkward and weird and wasn't really willing to go there and for me it would seem a shame to leave it to that same stage when it's so so late in the day yeah very good question yeah I wish it hadn't been sparked by that and by that shortened timespan and made it all more intense there's only so much you can do you can only offer you can't you can't change the way it's received there's a there's a course that I did once that said and it was about kind of healing with your parents and what they said is open the conversation by saying I love you and I know that you've always loved me and that that recognition of of their their love was that was the thing that would open the door and it worked I think I said it's my mom she said I know but I'd already said that to my dad and it hadn't kind of it haven't fixed the relationship so there's often there's always more work to do in ourselves as well there's often stuff that it's like we it's difficult to know whether it's really coming from a resolve place in ourselves and then whether we can we can actually come from that that place of healing my relationship improved a lot with my dad when I was in a really bad accident so we bonded through that any major injury yeah on this one I feel because I have such a great relationship with my dad I mean we have some incredibly deep conversations about the weather and what's gonna happen in the next 48 hours meteor odd meteor logically and you know what he's just not ready for those conversations anything deeper and you know what I've come to to accept is is a couple of things really one is that we all want a Superman for for our fathers and what we get is a human being and that's so that's that you know some stuff to work through and the other the other thing for me as well is to accept that like my dad's dad went off to war in the second world war came back couldn't really speak about it didn't ever speak about it didn't ever really parent my dad and so he is who he is and I ended up who I am and that perhaps our generation of the ones with the tools that we used to just gently try and unlock every now and again but wait if it's right and hopefully it won't be the three months to go stage that David was yeah I think it's pretty difficult to create a relationship that he doesn't have anywhere else in his life like it's very difficult to create a closer relationship than any of the other relationships that that someone has that's very difficult and I want to ask you about Superman this word came up thanks all of you for sharing such swords being so courageous I'm gonna use that word being vulnerable and sharing a little bit of your own honest truths and stories that's really moved me and being something quite powerful to encounter I guess I'm interested to ask you personally as as men fellow men what you do about your urge to fix the world or to try and be a Superman to solve things to have the answer to build a program that's gonna be you know the thing and maybe this is a kind of a man problem I don't know or is it okay how do you feel about that I have had that I definitely see it in my brother as well young called it like the archetype of the eternal boy like the golden child who were kind of on a mission to save the world and and men can be very into hero archetypes and personal development can really draw on that as well like you go on a hero's journey and so forth and I still feel it in me sometimes as well you know what am I going to do to set the world on fire and I guess one thing I can do is recognize that sometimes the real work is accepting yourself when you haven't done something amazing and you're not on some massive mission so that can be the hardest work when you're not kind of caffeined up and thinking ah this this is going to be the thing you know so yeah I think just recognizing that tendency in oneself and then it can be a form of unkindness to one because you know like Who am I when I'm not a superhero when I'm when I'm not being amazing and can I accept myself in that is I think really hard work yeah I guess um you know so I guess by now a lot of people are familiar with the the Jordan Peterson meme of clean up clean up your room and sort of this this notion of having starting small and and becoming responsible for one's own sort of inner world and and local space and without getting overwhelmed by trying to solve all the world's problems with some one utopian grand plan you know so I think that there's there's definitely in elements and a sentiment to that that makes a lot of sense so trying to fix the world has nearly killed me on several occasions and fortunately I've now come to a place with it where I'd still like to fix the world if I'm honest but I won't consider myself a failure if I don't manage to do it and that for me it feels like a real position to be in and so for me there's this kind of balance of not abdicating but also not overreaching and not projecting my own psychological fuck-ups onto external forces and going out and campaigning with that and I think that's really what Jordan Peters is saying like you know don't project your wounds and vulnerabilities out there into the world and concentrate on that fix that stuff first once you got far enough with that to not be a liability putting yourself out there crack on get on with it go do it so that's kind of my work-in-progress around it so I work with young people with a charity called mind and my job is in service design currently so I'm looking at how can we help young people in schools and reimagine mental health support for young people in schools so I spent the last sort of six weeks running focused group of young people and if the young people aren't forced to be there then it will always be girls if they're cherry in life they're cherry pick then you can kind of get you can get boys in the moon as well but even when the boys are in the room getting them to actually use their voice and to articulate their inner experience is incredibly difficult and draining this has been replicated it was every South London school that I've been in it's the same thing if the boy is not speaking up you've had some of these huge campaigns like time to change that's taken on mental health stigma for example from a seemingly unassailable position and beaten it down to a point where it's kind of okay to say I'm struggling now much more so than before and I'm curious to know our funders our governments do you see it on the horizon that this stuff is actually going to be looked at that perhaps it might be a good idea to start tackling this problem a little bit further upstream rather than waiting to the young people burn the village down just to feel the warmth how long have we got it's a huge question and I think I could go in and pick apart lots of different bits of that and the thing for me the piece I think that we can do is that bit about imagining what the healthy journey from being a young boy to a mature adult man looks like and rather than focus on pathologizing the problems really focus on what does the positive journey look like and can we lobby for those stages to be included within the curriculum in schools I would say how to get them into the room I wouldn't have gone to a mental health voluntary workshop when I was a teenager I might have gone to one on ideas and philosophy you could do one on like sports and values where you have some kind of game and then the kind of discussion afterwards or something like music and then some discussion afterwards so come at it sideways rather than straight on we're gonna fix you so that's that's supposed to I think that's a really great idea I think it's very difficult to reach men just by saying this will make you more healthy or you'll be more in touch with your emotions it's like okay why it's like okay this will help you get into a state for making better music or this will help you go to the state for making better art or or something I mean something around that I mean we're having this conversation as well with with rebel wisdom we're thinking about doing sort of martial arts to kind of tap into come and release your anger in a martial arts session and then do some sharing around it and reframe it within kind of there I think there has to be a function beyond just the the therapeutic benefit of it and I think no one's cracked it yet we're kind of talking about it as well and I think the other thing is mainstreaming this personal growth conversation it has to be made mainstream and it hasn't been yet and that's sort of something I think we're all like part of this evening tonight it's kind of there's there's clearly an appetite for it from the from the response that there's been in the room and yeah we're gonna wrap up now and say thank you very much for all of you came and are some great questions and you have some great responses in the break to Nathan from Band of Brothers to Michael from the US Army and Oxford University and to to jewels from the London philosophy Club and Thessaly Walker and David rebel wisdom thank you very much you
