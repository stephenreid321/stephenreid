so this is our second podcast and again we're going to kind of talk about Jordan Peterson because I think increasingly he's becoming this kind of lightning rod for the culture wars like he's he has become the paradox that we talked about before like a man who's talking about overcoming polarization and speaking to people you don't agree with he's becoming the most polarizing figure probably in the world certainly in the intellectual world right now and it's a fascinating phenomena in its own right and it's also just I think works as a kind of lens to look at a lot of deeper social dynamics yeah I know I agree and I think the last week or two was since the last podcast came out I've been almost a microcosm and maybe even a speeding up of that dynamic and Peterson maybe taking on a different cultural role so as a journalist thing would be interesting to hear from you in terms of obviously there was a New York Times article and there was the PC debate as well with with Stephen Fry and others starting with New York Times article and the response to it from a journalist point of view first off what do you make of that my sense is reading it was one most of the more his own words it was a very friend of mine said it wasn't a hatchet job it was a stiletto job which I thought was a brilliant way of putting it because it was all just very subtly done and it was and the irony was and I do think like so far I think Peterson has been quite lucky and his choice of opponents like the Kathy Newman interview Channel four put up the whole new whole interview unedited he he came out that interview thinking well they're going to cut this up and it's going to make me look terrible they put the whole thing up when he was shocked and speaking of someone who used to work for news I don't think they real what they were doing when they put that up there and I think if they could have taken it down they probably would have done but that worked in his favor I'm not converting and I think it might be quite easy within sort of his bubble and the bubble of the sort of Peters and fans of which obviously I'm kind of I am one but I'd like to try and think I like to think that as a journalist I should I'm able to kind of look at the bigger picture and see both sides I think that one has done serious damage because I think what it's done is crystallized views on both sides the reaction I saw afterwards on Twitter and the reaction that I saw afterwards on social media was gleeful on one side look we told you this guy was a misogynist we told you he was regressive and this proves it and so it's interesting I think to look at what's behind the polarization and I even think the term Peterson fans is interesting every time I hear it I kind of have a bit of a twinge of like what because you know I see myself as a fan of the truth you know and I think a lot of people who who are you know deeply inquiring into ideas would probably see the same thing and Peterson is popular because he's been speaking an awful lot of truth where do you think the polarization is coming from what the left is hearing with Peterson is there are these biological realities there are these things and that means these things are fated to be the case male and female gender roles are fated to be the case these things are fated to be the case this is what they're hearing from him and that's the huge reaction because it's like are we going to have to roll back to the 1950s I don't think that I I don't think that's the natural conclusion of what Peterson is saying what Peterson is saying is there are certain immutable truths about our biological existence that we need to acknowledge I was in Austin at the voice and exit festival and Brett Weinstein was there and hear in his talk he said we're we understand that we are not blank slates and for a long time the left was hoping that we are blank slates because then we can create them we can create the world that we want and no no restrictions and we just socially engineer it until we've got perfect world and that's what the left wants to believe not true clearly not true but Bret said we may not be blank slates but we are the blankest slates around because we're adaptive because we we are as successful as we are because we were able to be adaptive so biology is not fate and this is a key point that I think can get us to the other side of this polarization at the moment you've got the left effectively freaking out over what they're hearing from Peterson about like biological realities and all of this stuff and I think this is a problem I think Peterson is not helping because he is not making that case clearly and I don't know if he believes that or not I genuinely don't know if he does actually think everything since the 60s men and women working together all of this stuff might be an error might be an experiment that can't work and and we will end badly so if he is being misunderstood that's partly his fault for not sketching out that actually there is a place on the other side of this which is we recognize the fact that we have a biological reality we recognize our evolutionary heritage we recognise that men and women have different skills and adaptations to the world yet we can use this toolkit to do something different and as it's another taking another sort of line out of Bret Weinstein's thinking if we don't evolve past the toolkit we've been given by evolution we are going to extinguish ourselves because also in that toolkit is hardwired tribalism and we're seeing that we're seeing that play out like the social media has made all of this worse we are seeing all of these sort of different temperamental camps pulling into like isolation and as Jordan Greenhalgh said this is an extinction Airy level threat that we're now in armed camps around each other and everyone's kind of picking up on this in this polarization but there is and Peterson unwittingly is feeding into that polarization because he is not making that other leap beyond yes there is scientific reality that everyone that is not that he's in disputed in the scientific literature it's only the sort of bias of the of the mainstream media that kind of doesn't believe or doesn't want to accept all this stuff but he is not pointing to the deeper resolution and that is crucial and it's like it's like this idea of reviving your father from the underworld which is a central mythological idea it's like we have to re discover and reanimate the essential truths of our culture that's what he's saying like the logos lived out truth aligning oneself with the truth all of that stuff but that's gonna look very different now than it did in prehistory that resolution we're not going back to men and women in in completely separate spaces and all that stuff we've started an experiment in the 60s that we're going to have to see through but we're only gonna be able to see it through and I think a lot of this underpins like the gender dynamics and the problems with me too and the way that men and women are kind of also polarizing is to recognize that polarity and recognize that reality and then say and we move through we move through it we recognize that we have different experience of the world but and we're not equality doesn't mean equivalence it doesn't mean sameness we can reclaim polarity but we can reclaim in a conscious way that doesn't put one over the other it doesn't it doesn't mean that men and men are superior to women or any of the stuff that that a kind of that has been part of our kind of heritage yeah I find this absolutely fascinating this this concept coming out of evolutionary biology about your genes effectively having their own agenda self-replicating themselves being you know selfish so to speak and you know hearing Brett von Stein talk about it it mediately made me think in terms of kind of a global solution and that next step it is like the way the ego can be conceived of phenomenologically when you do inner work and it's what you know Eastern traditions have been talking about for a long time when you look at yourself and inquire into yourself there is there is an ego there which is in a sense a kind of a machine that is designed to help you survive in the world self-replicating machine it's got all of these drives that have very little to do with you very much so yeah and then not which also kind of maps on to the shadow idea as well yeah but the idea that we have these kind of programs that want the DOM and I want to control want to kind of to fight we need to integrate those yeah and the mistake what we normally try and do is suppress them that's what makes a shadow it's like oh I don't have that violent tribalism in me ama and a good boy it's effectively where it comes from and that's exactly it it leaks down you start projecting it outward and you could argue that racism and anagen has argued this racism is the ultimate explanation of the shadow you know see the ultimate way of seeing the shadow it's like the other nests within yourself and everything you hate about yourself gets projected on to the the other and it's a really fascinating concept because the ego is the object of the transformation so it's a mistake also to try and kind of kill your ego because you need your ego what you do is do transform your ego by taking a step back and looking at it which is very similar to what Bret Weinstein is talking about when he talks about not being the slave to your genes to be aware of it and go hey you know what I don't want to kill or be killed I don't want X Y Zed I'm going to be I think in a video releasing it cause it the captain of my own ship this is my airplane you know which it takes from the movie Sully this is my airplane and that is crucial and the only way in my opinion to get there is to really look at yourself and know how to do that and enter these states where you can really delve in and enquire and ideally doing that on a collective level or at least enough of enough people doing it is there something we touched on this in the last podcast but it's effectively this inability to recognize that we all have this tribalism is what's created the reaction of a brexit and Trump like this liberal this liberal idea of where the good guys we're tolerant part from those people who don't think like us and that's that's what we're seeing at the moment it's like this shadow and it's so easy to persuade oneself that we don't have a shadow we are the good people we are and and that because it's it's coming from a deeper place it's coming from this kind of it's like how in alignment is is your is your set of beliefs and your set of motivations and your set of not motivators but your your kind of intellectual center and your kind of reactivity Center because it's very rare in this world to find people who have both in alignment we've driven by things we don't we barely recognize as the whole kind of psychoanalytic insight is that we're not masters of our own house as again Peterson talks about and it's the other thing I want to kind of talk about as well is that this the IDW the intellectual darkweb concept so it was named by the New York Times a couple of weeks ago I think even that has the danger of becoming another tribalism because the reaction to the New York Times article I saw ben shapiro put out this really sort of castigating piece i mean quite rightly though the journalist had an agenda and it was though there was a lot to take on there but it's very easy for even the people in in this sort of intellectual dark web movement of which apparently we are on the outskirts or according to the website that's identified us as critical darker web which maybe means we're allowed to criticize I don't know like that can become another tribalism very easily because the whole idea I think for me if if the intellectual dial-up is to become a genuine thing and a genuine force has to be that there's some sense of I mean it is it is not homogeneous it's supposed to be heterogeneous - that's the whole point is that people don't necessarily agree but they are they agree to be able to have conversations so I think it's important that people disagree with in it or are allowed to disagree within it so I would criticize or at least question Peterson around a couple of things one of which is this is this not seeing the place beyond the polarization and I think also the way and I can completely understand this he's under unfair attack all the time so he would have to be superhuman to not react in some way to that and he clearly reacts and you see him on Twitter you see him I know of people who I think would be won over by his message who followed him on Twitter and stopped following because they're like this he's an angry he's an angry guy and I know there was an even a in an article quite recently I know he's been told if Twitter Peterson keeps coming out then that's the end that's the end of it and and you saw that in the debate just the other day in the free speech the monk free speech debates he was angry he was tetchy he he I mean he was again I'm completely unfairly attacked the guy on the other side said you're a you're a mean white man it's like I'm Peterson I thought the words that he used he dealt with it really well he said okay can call me mean maybe I mean I'm probably no more mean than many other people but why did you have to bring race into it which I think's absolutely right like why did you bring race into it how would it have been if that if it had been reversed I mean it's just that that's the the problem with identity politics all the way through is like it is essentially a divisive force pitting one group against another it's it's catastrophic but you saw Stephen Fry just dealing with it with a level of wit and lightness of touch and humor but firmness and you just thought wow this is what it takes to get the other side a bit of humor a bit of lightness and Stephen Fry actually said he used the G K Chesterton quote angels can fly because they take themselves so lightly which is a fantastic way of looking at it and as I said this is I am criticizing this I'd like for things this is constructive criticized because I because I think it would be almost impossible for Peterson to have reacted in any other way if you look at the trajectory that he's gone through over the last few months the kind of levels of unfair criticism the the way that he's kind of come from nowhere to being this kind of Centrepointe in in the public discussion it's almost impossible for anyone to ground themselves under that kind of projection and that kind of pressure and that kind of so I don't yeah I want I want to sort of frame it in these are the these are where I see is blind spots and if while I'm on this I'd also say I think he still kind of focused on a kind of student politics thing that there are other things that he could talk about like implicit in his work is the idea of that materialism is a doctrine the idea of only seeing the world has made up of material things has been a great impoverishment because we're not seeing ourselves as fully human and this is what we're seeing cascading through our culture and I think if we started emphasizing that rather than just emphasizing the dangers of SJW culture and all this stuff which is also true then suddenly I think people would be saying okay maybe he is an ally because I think he is an ally I think I think he's an ally for the left as well as the right but at the moment he's he's only being seen as an ally for the right because of his concentration on the excesses of campus culture and SJW culture but actually I think he I think implicit in a lot of ways saying is it's stuff that the left is concerned about as well he just has a different take on it like in a quote he talks about inequality it's a huge problem but it's a much bigger problem and the left realizes because it's built into almost every system and we have to be able to deal with it so there's an integration like he needs to be integrated and the reactivity to him almost without fail I've found shows something that has not been integrated in the person who's reacting there's an MV or there's there's an MB of his success or there's a inability to see him clearly or whatever so most of it is reactivity but there is also if we can integrate what he say is a culture like this deep history of West of Western thought that is not only Western thought it precedes Western thought it goes back to Mesopotamia integrates all of these other kind of much deeper wisdom traditions integrate that and move beyond I think we need to move beyond in but we need to integrate him first and IV I don't see many people able to integrate what he's saying and this is this is also a very interesting point you're raising I think so to get back to what you said about Stephen Fry and about the way Stephen Fry talked and that kind of lightness I've thought over the last couple of weeks that what's interesting is that you know in therapy it's very important to resource people to make them feel safe in order for them to look at the parts of themselves that they need to look at to to resolve a trauma or whatever it might be and when they're in the Paris when they're in the sympathetic nervous system mode in fight-or-flight mode which is where reactivity often comes from it is very very difficult / impossible to get someone to change their mind about anything so you need to get them resourced which is kind of what Stephen Fry is doing he's creating a safety by being like hey let's not take it too seriously like you know and there's a lightness and so that is I think you pull out of the conflict and the the if your goal really is to move beyond polarization and move towards a kind of yes and even if you disagree with someone then I think that's really important and I have absolutely no doubt that Peterson can do that extremely well with you know two or decades of clinical practice I just think it's probably extremely difficult or impossible to do it with thousands of people shouting at you every day you know on both sides I'm telling you you're the best thing since sliced bread and that you're a fascist yeah and and so we're Stephen Fry probably naturally does it is because he is a performer and and a very witty man as well he is a performer and there is and so the irony of what I'm about to say is that for all of the left's focused on tonality in the way people communicate things there is something to be gained from that because the way you say something doesn't change the intellectual merit or the logic of what you're saying but it certainly changes how it's going to be received but it also does change what you're saying how's the fire because if I say hello or I say hello yeah those are two different things those are two different things I mean the idea like the medium is the message it's the idea that this kind of bizarre slightly autistic often male insistence on no it's just the fact it's like no it's not just the facts it's like the way that you say something communicates almost more than the stuff that you're saying so there's this kind of bizarre insistence and you see it a lot I get into a lot of those arguments online where someone is saying you won't engage with what I'm saying it's like it's because the way you're doing it shows that one your wedded to a position that means there's no point in me engaging with you because you're just trying to prove yourself right why would I get involved in a conversation with someone who's just trying to prove themselves right and I can pick that up from the emotional charge with which you're coming forward I'm thinking of someone in particular I won't mention their name but because he's so obsessed with me he's gonna watch this and yeah but it's like if you're coming with this kind of obsessive quality or then it's like I'm not what's the point of engaging with you there's no way you're just it's not an open inquiry that the conversations we need to have and that's again coming back to the whole intellect or darkweb concept is the conversations we need to have are beyond reactivity they're beyond trying to prove ourselves right they've genuine inquiries into where is this person coming from what does this person got to teach me I may not know something crucial that's and that that's tied into the emotionality or otherwise of the way that this is delivered he I think is gonna have to recognize some of the reactivity of what he's bringing because if he doesn't he's going to continue to like what you what you resist persists it's the idea that the force that you're putting something out into the world will meet an opposite in equal force by definition and if he's coming from a slightly when he's one of the most integrated guys around like he's really integrated his shadow he's got his anger working for him he's got all this stuff but there is a reactivity and that's why some not all because I think he would create polarization anyway but some of the polarization I think is coming from that now this is our second podcast we're introducing a new member of the rebel wisdom team this is raffia Morgan who I'll embarrass him by by calling him the best facilitator I've ever worked with a very very wise man who is going to give us some of his wisdom see what comes we've concentrated at all on Jordan Peterson because for me what he symbolizes is the potential reintegration of the sacred into a society that I think have really lost its way in this kind of materialism and its kind of as Qatar cut us off from a really deep part of ourselves the religious the mythological the spiritual all these sort of ways that we yeah we used to make sense of the world and I think speak to something really deep in ourselves and the this is yeah what was your foot your first thoughts when you encounter Peterson I mean we're going to go on to because at the moment we were kind of reflecting on where his blind spots might be but just to start what what did you get from Peterson at the beginning what was your first kind of experience well I started listening to a lot of quotes which you are phonetically sending to me and I was like what there's a really intelligent voice out there who's addressing some of the main concerns things that are affecting my life questions that I've never been clear about or had before I felt like I was impressed guys done his work and and from the sound and feel of it he's taking the tough path and that suddenly he had a voice was kind of exhilarating for me and I really hoped that he was maybe the the cutting new cutting edge of a synthesis of a lot of the stupidity that's been around forever basically a lot of the polarization with a right and a left and the incapacity to talk and that there is somebody who gets the bigger picture and can weave this whole thing in a way that would address you know real-life concerns for lots and lots of people so I'm very enthused and I've used quotes from him in my groups particularly hid the work that he does and talks about integrating the shadow I feel has been had a direct application in my groups that's saying he articulated extremely well yeah my sense is that it would be almost impossible for him not to have had some kind of the way he's attacked I mean he's unfairly attacked again and again and again and again so he would need to be superhuman not to have some kind of reactivity to that but I mean we went to see him at the Hammersmith Apollo the other day and for the first half an hour he was kind of railing against the left and railing against the people who'd and who'd kind of been mistreating him and I just it just felt unnecessary like you've kind of you're at this kind of intellectual superstar level right now and and it seems to be getting to him in a way that is unnecessary and also I worry is just creating more of the same polarization that he's trying to get us past I really wanted him and really hope that he was going to represent something that kind of left the reactivity of the right and the left behind and started to offer something that was just so intelligent and I think he's capable of it when I sat in the crowd and when the railings against the left came they my my respect my energy level my attention span my enthrall my feeling of being in the presence of a really strong intelligence let's say went right down because there it was there was the personal stuff that was coming out that hasn't really been worked through you know yeah he got screwed on New York New York Times article was a hit job and he was he was gonna lose his job for a long time back last year I mean he's been you know and he has had to get in and show him one hand I love that he stands up in he creates polarity like between masculine and feminine he talks so intelligently about that and I think it's such an important thing to come out of you know the liberal left you you know all the post-modern everybody's the same kind of crowd you've done an awful lot of kind of work with with this kind of stuff what happens when you put out that kind of reactivity what where does it come from what does it create in the world well it's always we have to say everything that I have a strong emotional reaction to inside myself is informing me something about myself personally it's not an objectivity there's not a clarity there there's a strong emotional charge so it requires inquiry why do I have such a big charge there go into it a little bit come become a little bit more responsible and please save us from the blame game because it just it just immediately drives things down familiar old canyons that we know don't work in it's not what's needed right now we need we need Jordan to rise to his best and that means he has to be a little bit more media savvy sorry he needs to work on his own stuff like everybody else he can do it he advocates it and maybe not go on kind of overly simplistic tours because I had that feeling when I saw him that I was part of even even from the introduction to the whole thing there was a it got a little bit contrived to me I didn't wake up feeling inspired and I feel inspired by him often well the bit that really resonated was the Q&A at the end Q&A felt natural the delivery of the talk felt like I sort of told him yeah and it's a shame I mean there's two things that I would say one of which is that I feel assured also a similar kind of disappointment because he's carrying the hopes and I know I'm sure he takes this like he realizes this he's carrying more than his own fair share the burden like he's carrying the book he's going to these debates with sam harris i mean that he's carrying a sort of flame for this reintegration of the sacred for this great tradition of young this great tradition of all of this stuff that has to be I have no doubt has to be integrated for us to move forward we have to get past but this is kind of naive materialism and naive scientism that someone that sam harris represents it's like where religion is stupid and everyone else is stupid who doesn't think like it's just jack come on grow up who the arrogance of that is just ridiculous yes and he's carrying this like he's carrying here's the kind of the hero at the moment for this this other way of looking at the world I mean there was a debate that he did with this guy Matt Dillahunty though maybe try and show a clip of here where he pretty much everything that I saw said that he pretty much lost that debate and part of it was his body language he was kind of over like this and kind of dissed Matt Dillahunty was leaning back and kind of rare in control of it and and Peterson was was leaning only seemed peevish and tetchy and never quite completed what he was trying to say and I admire the guy pareve as much as I've admired certainly anyone in the public eye for a long time I put up put in some ways some of my sort of personal credibility behind supporting him making the documentaries and and so it's quite hard to see that happened I I'm just curious do you think that he's just bitten off more than he can chew right now is he is he trying to spread himself too wide I think that he maybe has internalized that he's on a solo mission when he doesn't need to be on the side of a mission yes that there are people trying to do the same thing as he is trying to do like the idea of rescuing your father from the belly of the whale the idea that we have to integrate our culture to move forward I know a lot of people who are in the same that same log yeah and he's gone I mean the impression I got when I met him in October in his house was he's come from soccer academia and a fairly small pond and he's now this kind of huge figure and and I worry that he deliberately or not is not taking in the right advice at the right times and just seeing that this thing is bigger than him this thing is he doesn't have to do it all alone and there are other people out there who can help with with the mission that we all kind of in in our own way like the same mission that we're on with Weber wisdom it's like this this is the time this is the time where we need to integrate all of this stuff because the way things are going at the moment the polarization is increasing there are existential threats and things feel very fragile this is what we're doing and rebel wisdom is about integrating the great ideas but also integrating the emotional reality integrating the deeper sort of embodied reality of what needs to happen because all of that needs to happen at the same time it can't just be an intellectual exercise yeah and of course it tends to go that way with him by his personality he seems very very dry I recommended recently he needed a night together with us seeing in the backyard bear yeah just talking and hanging out I just felt he was he was on edge and I and up something in me was like sank inside yeah a little bit I was like he's burning his pit and they're after him yeah he's an easy mark right now I felt that I mean I hope that he is getting good advice and because I I felt the same thing I felt for a while that most of the criticisms of him were unfair and I still think almost all the criticisms were here but there is this other level of you don't look like you're enjoying it don't look like you're enjoying it and this is the other thing that also there's there's kind of I think what I'm pretty sure that in underneath this like we've got a lot of Peterson fans who watch our stuff I reckon some of the comments will be sort of saying yeah you're just bringing in like he's just masculine and you're just bringing in this sort of feminine touchy-feely stuff and did it it is which it's like no yeah people will say that and you know it's just because you know I know for us revel wisdom and the way we're talking and looking at things is we're doing the work and part of that work is that we're going in and we're facing our own shadow sides and we're shape and and were exchanging our feelings and the outcome of that is it creates a grounded sense of masculinity that has feelings yes men also have feelings hello you know we do and their their personal and there are certain collective aspects to them and they're absolutely necessary for a communication that's going to be effective in this world and we always when we find ourselves in a strong reaction to something we turn that inquiry back here because there's always something inside that's trying to come to the light come to earth trying to inform us and I use my own reactivity all the time to look at myself it doesn't bring me into a feminine sprays space it brings me into a relaxed confident male space and I just feel Jordan recently it's just showing some things around the edge where it feels like he's you know stopped before you before you burned down the whole city just because you've got really reactive about something yeah you got hurt you're getting hit jobs you know you're being misunderstood you're being misinterpreted you're threatening a cell you're controversial you're right out on the edge it's gonna come back at you you know but have someplace where you go in there and you just don't try and just out think and in that out thinking come to some kind of blame because blame doesn't work blame registers as a kind of weak response show up and and show up inside yourself and and work through that reactivity and it will make a huge difference in what comes out of his mouth if he does that mmm I thought this before it's like he says it's all implicit in the stuff that he's talking about the idea that people don't have ideas ideas have people so this reactivity to the kind of SJW types while understandable can we not find compassion for people who've been kind of sold a pop in terms of their view of the world even duped and we yeah misinformed yeah yeah yeah we can do that and we can and we can and we can have a certain compassion for that and we can show that in a light that doesn't have to be waving a big torch you know against something else we need a bigger vision that is more inclusive and that is not giving up taking a stand it's taking a stand for a higher vision that is more inclusive that is willing to get the right that is willing to look at the left that can find some kind of synthesis out of all that and stand for that and address the real issues and not just get lost in the kind of name-calling polarity stuff that's been going on forever and it's just so tiring one last thing I'd like to say which is I have a sense just having gone back from America the voice and exit festival in Austin I don't think they are going to be able to find that or I think it's will be very very difficult and to find that sort of place beyond the polarity in America because I think everything's so polarized there so split I have some hope that that could happen in the UK that we have more of a of a civility we have more of the humor which able is able to kind of diffuse these conversations and also that we the talent for the UK is for synthesis like we're we're very good at synthesis in New York and comedy and that's the essence of creativity is taking stuff from here and stuff from here and stuff from here and putting it together that's the essence for the British creativity I have a hope that that conversation can happen here and that's what I want river wisdom to be able to do to be able to have that conversation hold that space of beyond the polarization and the integration of all of the sort of the other the other stuff at the same time I hope me to very much and I agree with you that this is a place of synthesis and a lot of times the dawning of the first things in if there's a clear enough message that comes out from here it will catch on in the states it's not like everybody is so in their camps although I think in general the polarization is it's really really great and it's not there so there's a limit to the create creative kind of exchange that can happen everybody reverts to camp so you've just flown in literally out of a two hours ago and landed in London from Austin Texas from the voice and exit festival and we have a lot of really great content coming up for that so what what was the festival like who did you interview how was it so the voice and exit festival styles itself as burning man meets Ted which is true it was the the production the the whole thing around that was brilliant like it was really really well put together so a lot of kind of techno utopianism blockchain stuff like that which I am less interested in like I feel there's a kind of utopianism that doesn't really recognize the shadow and doesn't really recognize some deeper integration but also they had the other side of it as well Bret Weinstein was there Jamie wheel was there this sort of flow consultant and we've got some fantastic interviews with both of them coming up and yeah feels like yeah it feels like we this is this is kind of what we're trying to do with rebel wisdom it's like we've we've done we've had a big focus on Peterson because I think what he's bringing forward is a huge huge value and I also want to kind of expand and say these are the other people
