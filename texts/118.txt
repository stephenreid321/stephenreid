story starts in Libya in 2011 where I used to be a foreign news producer so I was in Libya for the fall of what turned out to be the fall of Gaddafi's regime the rebels were coming into Tripoli there was gunfire in the air we got into Gaddafi's compound and we're there with the Gaddafi's tent which had been burnt rebels are firing their guns in the air there's what a couple of times in my life where I felt like I'm in the middle of history this feels like an amazing place and I got my phone out and I called my parents I was like I just want to hit get them to hear about all the guns going off this kind of amazing moment and I got my mom on the phone and I spoke to her and I was like listen to this this is amazing and then literally surrounded by kind of yeah this this incredible moment and she started crying and I was like what's the matter and she said I'm at the hospital your dad's just been diagnosed with cancer we don't know too much but we know it's bad and he was 63 years old he was fit he was though literally just been on a cycling holiday that the week before when he felt ill and had gone in and we knew at stomach cancer we knew that the prognosis for stomach cancer wasn't really wasn't very good and I then broke down in tears as well and got home as quickly as I could well I should fill you in a little bit of the backstory before I won in the air flying from Libya back to the UK I never got on well with my father we always fought and yeah throughout my one of the the primal memories that I'm sure I've shared with a few of you today is that I remember the thing that the thing that I realized later when I did a lot of men's work that annoyed me I knew I fought with him I didn't really know why until it was later on it can set I contextualise that I understood it and it was because he was a sort of 1780s new man he really wanted to be different from the father figures of his we really wanted to be someone different which is why I felt it was so tragic that when we used to play football he'd be like why did why do you have to have a goal why can't just pass it to each other that's kind of and I never realized at the time but it was like this denial of the male competition the male drive the male kind of like mmm that feeling and I remember fighting with him and I remember fighting them to the point where he grabbed me by my throat and held me up against the wall once and I can remember the feeling of euphoria in me when he did that because it was like yes and I know again I never contextualized it until later but that was what I was doing is looking for a boundary I was looking for that point I was looking for that place in him and I found it and I know from my mum later that really traumatized him like he really he really struggled with that the fact that I pushed into that the fact that he realized he had that in him and it he really struggle with it for a long time afterwards and it was only sort of through men's work later on that I realized that really owning that pardon myself was was a really essential thing to do that dark side that that killer that that kind of yeah that part that we all have that in a totalitarian that in a kind of Dominator that's when I realized later I felt safe and that's why I felt safe when I saw that part of him a bit of context so now I've landed in London and going to Southampton I arrived at the hospital and I see my father and I go up to him and I just embrace him and I keep embracing him and my friend who's brought me to the hospital realizes after about five minutes of this hug that he's in the presence of something really special and he takes a picture of it which is now on my wall at home like this amazing picture and I've had lots of people reflect that there's something like lots of people have said how powerful that picture is because there's something about the way I'm holding him and the way he's collapsing into me that feels like a kind of transfer or of there's something something shifts at this moment and then after that I realized I thought he's going to be gone in he was given three months to live basically after that he went back into the hospital they did tests he said yeah you've got three months to live and so I sent him a letter saying look I've done all of this in a work I've done all of this men's work and I've got all of these amazing reflections from people and people talk about my authenticity and my integrity and my honesty and all these things I've realized that their qualities I got from you whatever I've never admitted that to you I've always fought with you but I've never admitted I've never realized that they're your qualities and it really moves him getting this letter and after I said I thought well why the why the  doesn't everyone do this why doesn't everyone he's got three months to live so I got it I then got in touch with all of his friends from every period of his life I got in touch with the family I said look he hasn't got long to live so if you've got anything to say you might as well say it now and they all these letters started coming in and he got very sick and my mom ended up sort of reading a lot of them to him in his bed and there was all this amazing stuff there was he what was extraordinary is that he viewed himself as a failure his big his core wound was that he believed that he was a failure he'd never really achieved anything and all of this stuff started coming back he was an arts officer for the council and we got stuff back saying the Theatre Royal in Winchester wouldn't exist if it wasn't for you the Southampton Film Fest would never have happened if it wasn't for you you started the street parties in the road a generation of children grew up knowing what knowing what community was because you and all of us amazing feedback and somehow the last three months of his life shifted this image that he'd had of himself this feeling of being a failure and it was incredible it was an incredible gift that was catalyzed just by that moment I think in the hospital that healing that moment of connection and I don't fully understand it but I believe that and I'm sure that would never have happened if I hadn't been able to heal that place in myself that was still in conflict with him the work that I've done this kind of work the men's work we were all there when he died just before Christmas 20 17 20 2011 it was an incredibly emotional moment it was incredibly emotional time it's an incredible cathartic time incredible precious time for us as a family and I've told this story before and I've I think it's one of the most precious periods of my life it's one of the most precious things I've ever been involved with and for me it just shows them the magic of this kind of work the magic of the inner work and how it can catalyze amazing changes in the outside world and usually this is where the story ends but that's not where the story ends because I realized afterwards I'd internalized his image of himself but up until this age of whatever 36 when when he died I believed him I believed his image of someone who was a failure and so that period of getting all these reflections and realizing all of this amazing stuff my dad had done by the time he was my age he had three kids he'd he'd created the NART center of Southampton he created and Film Festival he created he'd say he'd done this incredible stuff by the time he was my age and it completely shifted that was really tough to then realize that this guy that I thought was was a failure to chief far more than I had at that age and so the next five years have been an incredible up-and-down journey for myself to Michael [Applause]
