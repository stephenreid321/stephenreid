you [Music] so this is a very quick housekeeping film with four announcements the first is we've got some really great content coming up we've just done really good interview with Gabor Mattei which is gonna be part of a whole series that we're going to bring out on psychedelics the second is that we're about to do a Q&A and we're gonna give the other details in a second of how to kind of contribute questions to that third we've got some really interesting stuff coming up on patreon and fourth is the launch of rebel wizard live which is our live streamed event series starting with one we're quite excited about which is called the war on art with Tim lot who regular viewers will be familiar with and the author Lionel Shriver who wrote We Need to Talk About Kevin and they're going to be talking about censorship and political correctness in literature and art so it's been a while since we've done a QA and the thing that we're trying to juggle like the complicating factor is that we want to give priority to patrons if you're supporting us on patreon then if you're supporting us ten dollars or more then you'll guaranteed an answer to your question five dollars one dollar you would be more likely to answer that but then we've got the issue that we the the tags that people have on YouTube don't necessarily match with the the patron that their real names on patreon so what we're going to do if you're if you're a patron send your question on email to this address that's coming on-screen now and also but if you're not a patron put a question in underneath the line here we'll we'll answer whatever we get round to but will guarantee to answer $10 and up if you're a five-dollar patron you're probably going to get your question answered one dollar will we'll consider it more but we'll also look through the questions underneath this and if there's one who particularly liked them we'll definitely answer those and talking of patreon we're also going to be launching some exclusive content on there very soon the first one is the story of rebel wisdom so it's the two of us kind of giving a little bit more background into what we're doing what our mission is how this all came about yeah so that will be coming up very soon so increasingly we'll be putting stuff on to patreon either as early access or as exclusive content because this is now a full-time job so the way that we at the moment are thinking that we're going to make it sustainable is by upping the amount of stuff on patreon and encouraging people to subscribe so if you like that content if you like while putting out there then please do subscribe on patreon we there's some really good stuff up there already for example Tim lot talking about the similarities and differences between Jordan Peterson and Alan Watts we have the second half of our really amazing interview with Warren Farrell and also the second half of our interview with Douglas Murray and a lot of other really good content as well so please do sign up on patreon ask us a question below the line and yeah see you see
