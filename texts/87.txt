this is our first road trip to California we put out on our last podcast and said who should we interview when we come over here and about three or four people I think three people commented in the YouTube comments saying Paul Vander clay you should check him out and then a couple of people emailed me separately to say go and check out Paul so our audience has brought us together and I'd love to know I mean we're in your is this the Sunday School Nursery yeah hence the the giraffes behind you and the camels behind me just getting that out of the way now so Paul I'd love to hear like where are we who are you and why what's brought us together well my name is Paul Vander clay and I'm the pastor of Livingstone's Christian Reformed Church here in Sacramento California what's brought us together is jordan peterson i about six seven months ago I've been following Jordan Peterson for about a year and I'd been blogging about him I've had a blog for years and at some point I was reading Neil postman's rereading the book I had read in the 80s I'm using ourselves to death which talks about media and the way it changes messages and shapes message and empowers message and I thought I should probably do a video about Jordan Peterson and I made a couple of them and I had had a little I had 15 subscribers on my youtube channel where I was doing a show with Freddy Schuler who you probably met this morning just something because he wanted to do a TV show with me and that's all I had done and then suddenly there were more people watching my channel and I began getting letters from people talking about how helpful my commentary had been for them to understand Jordan Peterson and frame him within a Christian context so I kept doing it and I've continued to do it since then and I've watched many of your videos and very much appreciated them so here we are it's quite a surprise to me hmm yeah cuz I guess my journey with Jordan Peterson as well started probably about a year ago my first him wrote a blog about him and then luckily got to interview him in Toronto and since then like I I have a sense like that there's Jordan Pederson himself and then there's what he represents and for me what I think he represents is a kind of potential for the reintegration of a Christian tradition that I think the materialist world has kind of lost and potentially a kind of reintegration of the sacred itself which is what I think I saw when I first saw him I'm like wow this is such a vital message for the times and you you're coming from over I guess a very different place in terms of you live in that sacred world you live in that Christian world so what what does he represent to you the first thing I saw was their Christians Christians read this book that says we live under a dome and God is up and the world is down and there's people under the world they live in that space during church and then they go out into the world and we're on a globe and we're flying through space and when I listen to Jordan Peterson church has always talked about God coming from above and that right now is getting nowhere with huge groups of people and here I Jordan Peterson was coming from below and he's trying to connect heaven and earth again which is where the why the conversation always goes back to the physical nature of the resurrection so I watched this and I thought this is and then I listened to a lot of people watching him saying I'm interested in going to church and I'm interested in exploring this and it was very clear Jordan Peterson was rocketing up the hierarchy and not everybody was going to get a chance to sit down and talk to him and I'm available and so they find me and so then as a Christian minister I'm a proxy that's right I'm I'm down I'm way down at the low end of the feeding chain which is okay by me I like my pastor small Church I like small things what's exciting about it is we get to do what we're doing now sitting talking face-to-face this is what I enjoy yeah lots of things to pick up on you remind me when you talk about sort of Peterson talking about the bottom-up nature of I guess the bottom-up nature of religion and religious revelation you might say there's an echo of his conversation with ben shapiro when ben shapiro was talking about like he's obviously very into the kind of jewish revelation and the biblical stories being true and he was Peterson was saying yes but you can also get there another way there's there's some sense in that the revelation from below like evolved morality and the psychological reality of the stories like a very human level also matches this sort of revelation from above of this is somehow divinely like I guess in in the history in history it would have been this is these have come from God it's sort of it's a sense of them both coming together in some sense very much so the john calvin so i'm a Calvinist pastor calls the the census tamanna tata switch says that god has built into us a way to hear him I hadn't heard someone making I hadn't heard someone making a compelling case like this that was actually getting traction with people and was clear Peterson was getting traction and so then I said I've got to listen to this guy I've got to figure out what he's saying and why it's working and what how I should respond to what's happening around him how is it being as well because Peterson has obviously began it been getting more and more controversial and I've kind of felt this as well sort of like you end up getting in into conversations no he didn't mean that it wasn't about that how is how is that being like a people started arguing with you or judging what you're saying or how does that mean I deeply suspect there are a number of friends of mine that are deeply concerned for me because of this jordan peterson thing because they hear again the sound bite world grabs a few things jordan peterson is a bigot he's transphobic he's homophobic he's you know the godfather of the patriarchy whatever he is and so paul but the thing is they know me they know i'm not a bigot they know they know where I was raised they know who's in my church they know they know me by my actions so what to do with this I've given Jordan Peterson in a sense a year of my life what do you do with that well they don't know what to do with that so they're quiet and they watch and they wait I I do think YouTube is a place for people with little to lose and I have a son who is you know might very well have a career in politics he's worked in politics and he just asked me he says you know something you know I see what you're doing and part of me thinks I should get a youtube channel I think no don't do that you're you're you know you're 20-something years old you're gonna get on there and you're gonna start doing what I'm doing and who knows what that's gonna mean twenty years from now I'm in my 50s I can get on there and I I've already got a pretty good filter I know if I would say I'm not gonna be a Christian anymore I'm gonna be a Muslim I mean that would get me into trouble so don't so I've already got my internal filter so to a certain degree in the little places that the Christian Church is I've got my place on the hierarchy I why don't I use the status I have for what I think is right if I don't do that what is that mean I am you know then then suddenly I am all of those things that on Sunday morning I say I shouldn't be then I'm I'm concerned about my status and I'm not willing to do what I think Jesus did you know why did Jesus do what he did it's a crazy thing to imagine if you imagine the story that he if he had this kind of power of course skeptics up now I didn't do miracles okay what he if he had this kind of power he had this kind of following well I throw it all away when you could have talked your way out of what was clearly you know ridiculous charge that you would you would be killed for well he he believed what he said and he cared about people that this world doesn't care anything about I want to see people people do that all the time I want to I want to see that recognize I want to see people do that because yes there are these hierarchies and they are real but what God says is I'm gonna go to the absolute bottom and I'm gonna serve the rest of you and if you think about a God who won't even let himself be seen who regularly gives us Sun and food and all of these things God is the most humble creature in the universe that's why it's hard to see so I why not spend my life doing that and people say well you're gonna get rich and famous with this Jordan Peterson thing I already made I'm already able to feed my family and my kids are you know they're into college now so if I can if I can do well by them what more do I have to ask for and just to come back to your tell me a bit more you're a pastor tell me about the community and and kind of what's your day-to-day life look like well the community is an outrageously diverse struggling community the this is this would be a poor section of Sacramento there are a lot of group homes where there are people who are on permanent disability for mental illness there's a fair amount of drugs homelessness we didn't have any homeless people or untreated schizophrenic sin Church this morning but that's fairly common for us here how can we pray for each other this morning day to day is dealing with that community to a degree it's it's working with my congregation talking to people who come to me and so the Petersons stuff kind of fit in except people are coming to be now via YouTube and or via emails or comments and I'm engaging with in conversation with them it's a small it's a small congregation which gives me the opportunity to do what we're doing today and you started putting out commentaries on Peterson you've you found like a lot of people following on YouTube how's that being kind of going from this small community of what we had 20 or 30 people in church before to kind of potentially a global audience at least being contacted by people around the world how's that being well it scared me to death when it first started because in two weeks I had you know a thousand 1,500 people listening to what I was saying and I thought well this can't keep at this pace because that would destroy what I've been building here for a long time eventually it tapered off and I've learned that it's been at a manageable pace and so I can both take care of my congregation and interact with people and that's and that's what I like and has it been a learning experience for you as it developed your ideas or what's what's the process being for you of kind of going from from here a bit more out coming out into the world and I've always been a lifelong learner so I've always read philosophy read history I've always done that but this has probably been the most the most highly charged fruitful learning experience I've had in my life with a possible exception of moving to the Dominican Republic learning a new language and having to live in another culture because what happens is I have very smart people from around the world send me links and book ideas and resources and push back on my videos and it's it's been tremendously fun and an incredible education and what do you think you've learned the most from it that the church the churches insularity is both a natural byproduct of what she has to do to create real community but it's also its greatest hindrance to actually speaking to people outside of herself the church so many people they've already toured impede erson put them on the road to being interested in church I've kind of given them another nudge and then they start looking around for church and it's just a disaster and my heart my heart bleeds when I hear that because what I would want as a Christian pastor would be that they would find a church that could help them sort themselves out where they could find community where they could without fear explore whatever crazy idea they have and talk about that and and work that through and most churches simply aren't interested in that and it's it's a tragedy mmm they're not interested I'm not capable or what do you both how many pastors listen to Jordan Peterson some more than will admit to it but I have a small highly permission giving Church and so I'll have a meet up here in a few hours where you know 15 to 20 people will come together and we won't pray we won't do communion I had one of my old-timers stop in and listen once and I'm not sure he knew what was going on but he trusts me so if the pastor's doing this it must be okay and people are working on their stuff will they become Christians certainly not all of them but we opened the church for a meetings all kinds of good things for the community this is an important thing for the community this is really interesting to me it's like I guess there's a there's a real tension in Peterson's relationship with Christianity and the Christian Church because he doesn't describe himself as a Christian and I'd love to get your kind of thoughts on that because he's kind of a like he's pulling people towards a deeper appreciation of the Christian story but it's in a slightly different way to the church can you pull that apart for me because I can sort of sense there's a tension here but I don't really understand it some some of the tension some of the tension is in Christianity itself what is a Christian if you grew up in the Muslim world and you came to North America you would say almost everyone here is a Christian and if you pull someone off the street say are you a Christian they might say yes they might say no so there's a tremendous amount of ambiguity in terms of the definition of a Christian Peterson Jonathan pooja has one of the better arguments I think he says he's like Cyrus he's who was this Persian Emperor who in the Book of Isaiah Isaiah calls him the servant of the Lord which is a tremendously high saying in the Book of Isaiah which then eventually gets referred to Jesus but Cyrus is this pagan Persian Emperor who has hundreds of wives and you know destroys nations and all of this but God used Cyrus to send the Jews back to rebuild the temple and Jonathan pojo and his Eastern Orthodox frame I can see where that really works for him I see a John the Baptist vibe in Jordan Peterson John a lot of people don't know John the Baptist had a following that extended a couple of centuries he was a huge deal but then you know what did Jesus do and what followed Jesus so Christians have this huge debate people write me I'm praying for Jordan Peterson it becomes a Christian other people write me know he'd better not become a Christian now because none of the atheists will listen to him well I'm content to let Jordan Peterson B Jordan Peterson and let God do with Jordan Peterson whatever God's going to do I I'm one of the things you learn in ministry is not to to quickly define people because people are people their enormous ly complicated and people you might put them in a category they're in the Christian Reformed Church if you know enough Christian inform doctrine and you you quiz them enough oh there there are a hodgepodge of all kinds of beliefs why isn't Jordan Peterson so I I'm comfortable not answering the question I guess I got a sense that like for me certainly like I always had a sort of spiritual leanings I studied Buddhism and Hinduism study philosophy at university and I've always had a kind of spiritual side to to my interests and it wasn't really until listening to Peterson that I kind of was really able to frame the Christian story in a new way and really understand the sophistication of the Christian kind of metaphors and the idea of dying to your cert like that kind of the idea of the Cross of like one dies to oneself every moment to be reborn and has to allow the dead wood to die off all these kind of great very very meaningful a very profound ideas but there's a sense that he's almost pointing away to an integration of the Christian story that points beyond it in some ways that that I wonder if that's kind of threatening to the idea of like the Christian Church based around a set of I'd an ideology as much as a sort of fixed idea or a dogma he's almost pointing beyond that in some ways that is that part of the tension maybe I when I listen to him I think he's actually only going halfway for example if you listen closely to his Easter videos the gospel for him is pick up your very heavy cross and drag it uphill and if you do so you will experience meaning and you'll sort out your life and you'll make the world better there's a there's a stoicism to Peterson and as I then one of the person one of the people who watches me a lot of people who watch me then they go to his things and they ask him questions they ask him questions that I'm playing with and they write me back and so one person at one of his at one of his book tours got the question through that said okay what's at the top of the hill you're pulling the cross up and I'm too tired I would need too much time to unpack that I don't think that's a Dodge I think Peterson is working as hard as he can to figure out what's at the top of the hill in Christianity none of us know that you know Paul says well I've been to the third heaven and we have these images of the the kingdom of God and they're all built into this rich this rich symbolic system but none of us can describe it so I I think actually he's he's where he's really out right now is a certain stoicism that is that people are finding tremendously helpful I think at some point they're going to say what's at the top of the hill it can't be too utopian because he's made it clear that we're not going to arrive at that in this frame so is there there there and I was reminded in the in the church service today about Young's because I get young as his his metaframe that he's using to appreciate all of this and Young had an interesting relationship with God where he was asked do you believe in God and he said I don't believe I know which there's a kind of interesting connection with Christianity there because fundamental as far as I understand it Christianity is the idea that we need faith because we don't know there must be doubt and doubt must coexist with faith so yeah I'm interested what you make of that well Young was the son of a Swiss Reformed pastor a very depressed man apparently his father was and a rather unhappy man my definition of a Christian and that I tell my congregation is do you trust Jesus more than you trust yourself well what does that mean we have to unpack that and that scales in every moment you know I'm doing an interview with you I don't know you unfortunately I'm not high enough up the hierarchy that you know rebel wisdom destroys paul van der clay so we extend trust and obviously this is a very small stakes thing but life is full of huge stakes things and who how where can I place my trust how do I know that Jordan Peterson I don't think he's a flim-flam artist I've watched people on my whole life I don't think he's disingenuous at all I think he's enormous ly open and making himself vulnerable I have a sense of knowing that could I be wrong you know I could be wrong but you live with what you know you don't have any other choice so I was raised by great parents and I was I learned to love Jesus as a child and I've seen no reason to give it up now now if you ask me if I trust Jesus more than I trust myself no way I'm a you know part of what's nice about being a Calvinist as I can say I'm a wretched sinner and I'm a really lousy Christian and you can still be a pastor and be that in the Calvinist Church yeah cuz after the service today I was talking to some of the people who came and one guy I was talking to for a little while and then he said I you a believer and I couldn't answer I didn't know what he meant I was like I I just and he obviously wanted me to say yes or no and I didn't know like what that question means and I guess I came to what did I say I think I said something like I've got a deeper appreciation of the Christian stories I've got a deeper appreciation of the essential metaphorical rightness of a lot of it and it became quite a long answer how should I answer that question this is part of the insularity of the Christian bubble because people say Peterson is copping out by saying you know do you believe in God what do you mean by belief what do you mean by God when Peterson says that I think Peterson's a hundred percent correct when this guy asked you are you believer he's out he's doing code talk within a little bubble you could have said yes and a whole bunch of things he would have imagined that I don't know you very well but probably aren't true for your life you don't go to church every week you don't tithe you there's not all these practices built into you but to say no well believer in what so as a Christian pastor often when people engage in code talk I pause them and I can do this because I'm a pastor and say what do you mean by saved well then you find out what they mean and then you can say okay and move it around a little bit see what you can do with the conversation so I think you answered very well actually he's probably confused and went on with his life because he was he was looking for the secret handshake and this is what happens in Christian churches and so people listening to Jordan Peterson come into a Christian Church they get asked a question like that well right away now I know I don't belong I don't know the handshake so that's a hard thing there's a really interesting topic because I guess how does the Christian Church absorb deal with and they capitalized but at least kind of Italy find a way of making use of the kind of what seems to be a bit of an awakening going on of people who are watching these biblical stories and getting an awful lot from it because at the moment isn't they're not really receptive or able to receive how do they do it I don't know that they will which is sad so well I started a meet-up and in some ways that meetup for me is is it a church plant no cuz it's not a church we don't have sacraments we don't have all those things of Church is a a church that's a really complicated question because look at what a look at how a a started look at what people have to do to get into it I've had people join this church because they're in naa 25 years and they said I need something my higher power needs a better definition okay well let's keep let's keep talking so I it may be and this it may be that there is a revival of sorts that happens in Jordan Peterson's wake but this is the history of the church if you look at the church and see all these tiny little sub movements or they all started because something happened that put a twist on everything and a whole community came in look at Methodism this has happened again and again and again in history will there be another little group of churches that's get started because Jordan Peterson brought a whole new thing to people and it didn't fit into the regular Church and so here it begins I don't know could happen Peterson ISM Peterson I am gonna get in trouble for that for saying what I just said I know but I'm old enough to not care too much I was actually raised a Methodist my parents were Methodists which probably only up until I was sort of 10 years old 11 years old something like that but so I don't know what it means so much except except that it was more about trying to understand how Jesus would have lived but it's more that's what I understood of Methodism it was more about looking looking him him as a as a guide mm-hmm was that that be right yeah almost every new church movement and heresy starts because a group of people say I want to know the real Jesus and and you guys have lost your way right yeah and so then they start their own little thing and then that goes for religions are very long things goes for a few hundred years and then I regularly have Jehovah's Witness come to my door and if I have enough time I'll sit them down and I'll start asking them questions about what they really believe and yeah they're heretics for the jobs witnesses because other stuff is coming into them and that process is always happening so well I'm not God and I'm happy to not be him at the moment Jordan Peterson's going into some debates for Sam Harris if you listen to the Vancouver ones I have yeah what was your impression of the Vancouver debates I thought they were helpful in terms of I think the optics of those debates are as important as the as the content of them I didn't hear anything out of Peter almost his axioms were new and I wish he'd put them on his website but most of what I heard out of Sam Harris you could hear on many many of his podcasts but the fact that these two individuals are sitting down talking engaging in a productive way that's to me that's a win and I that's what happens at our meetups this is what I'd love to see more as a Christian minister I long for the opportunity to sit down with people and just hear what they think and talk about it and there's not nearly enough of that happening in churches or outside of churches and so to watch that happen and that people pay to hear it that's I think it's just terrific and do you think that there's any flexibility on either side o do you think sam Harris might kind of turn around and just and say actually you're right there are truth has to be embedded in stories I've realized that this whole atheism rationality thing is is actually only a partial truth and you're right there are too far up the hierarchy to let that happen but what are we doing why so some people come to my meetup and they say I used to be right there with Sam Harris now I'm not so sure why because our mental minions are in there listening and our conscious self is only this little part of it and they're all used Jonathan heights the elephant is making decisions the rider is just giving rationale so Harris's way up the hierarchy some high profile people have flipped both ways so is it possible he could in the future yeah is it likely no but that's not what the point is about the point is let's hear your argument let's hear your argument what do I think of it so I started making videos because I'm watching these conversations and I'm I want to butt in I want to have a part I want to be a part of it and YouTube kind of let me be a part of it and that's what's that's what's happened since now I'm having these conversations with dozens of people and it's wonderful well what's happened is Peterson is getting incorporated I mean it's one brain here why do I start studying people like Peterson it's to incorporate him and when he says things in a certain way I think play it's a lot better way to say it so what am I gonna do I'm gonna use it pastors are thieves we're not just Liars we're thieves and when we hear something that works well I'm gonna grab that I'm gonna work that forever Peterson's whole says it all the time finally gets into my thick skull you know our values stack up in hierarchies well in my Sunday School class I said right now in our culture we have a confusion between love and kindness love is higher in the hierarchy than kindness as well it should be when kindness is at the top of the hierarchy that's the permissive parent who gives their kid whatever he wants the loving parent sometimes will say no to their child so kindness is lower on the hierarchy the whole story of Jesus a number of years ago when I was studying the book first Peter I realized the New Testament is all about status and hierarchies and it's got this crazy story where Jesus on one hand says you're all equal and it's like oh that's radically egalitarian and then he says but I'm at the top of the hierarchy and Jesus is about to serve Jesus gathers his disciples together and everybody in their mind has this hierarchy and Jesus at the top and they're about to celebrate the the the Exodus dinner and Jesus stands up he takes off his clothes I told my Sunday School class said imagine if I step up and take off my clothes here we'd call nine-one-one stood up take off his you know stripped down his underwear I wrapped a towel around him and starts washing his disciples feet and his disciples they're all work in the house no no no Jesus says if you don't let me wash your feet you can have no part of me Peter says well wash my whole body just like the feet are enough and he washes their feet what what's jesus doing with the hierarchy it's just he's becoming a servant and almost every text has this dynamic so the top becomes the bottom and because the top becomes the bottom he's really at the top we have this in our national conversation who is the president's supposed to be the servant of all and the president so you know the captain of the Titanic go down with the ship why make sure everyone else is off and then you and we all know this this is deep within us now you might ask well this is this only Christianity or listen to Peterson well maybe it's even deeper still so what does that mean the Christianity is actually an outgrowth of of the deeper principles that's right which is exactly what CS Lewis says in the line in which in the wardrobe when Aslan allows himself to be killed on the stone table and then the stone table breaks and CS Lewis says well there's a deeper magic because he gave up his life for Edmund the rebel and now Aslan is arisen and the new reign of Aslan begins in winter istic is gone so this is the Christian story and it's all over the place in our culture but people don't recognize it this is the most infuriating argument that you could ever use as an atheist which is you're a Christian pretending not to be which is kind of it's yeah it you could imagine how how that would feel to someone like Sam Harris if Peterson said to him well look at your actions look at the way that you behave you cannot help but be a Christian because this morality is deeply embedded in everything that you've it's in every fiber of your being yeah yeah you you're not gonna get away from it and I think Sam era should turn around and say yeah you're more of a materialist than you want to admit and I think that's true - because we're it's it's all mixed within us and I think this huge culture war we see happening in the West is a Christendom civil war because I can establish you know same-sex marriage I can establish a person perfectly reasonable understanding why you know gay people's relationship should be sanctified by the church I can also argue the other way around and so in an ancient in the ancient world ancient Egypt or ancient Rome would be like you know marry your gay lover well what would you do that for I mean that makes no sense to them but wow there's this long line of things that have happened to marriage through Christianity and all of this we're just so deeply embedded in the whole thing that we're just having Christian arguments back and forth and you might even argue that as Western Western culture or as Scott Alexander he's a blogger argues universal culture continues to dominate around the world well in a funny way evangelization is happening by secularists who claim there is no God because these ideas that if Christianity deeply embedded in them are just being picked up by people of all over the world and there's a lot of people now calling themselves who used to call themselves atheists now call themselves Christian atheist yeah yeah isn't that crazy yeah not I think it's tremendously fun because well what's more fun talking about what's closest to our hearts and gives us meaning and that's you can't have no more fun than sitting in a room and doing that for a few hours I just appreciate the chance to do this and it's it's an amazing thing that I sit there and talk to the camera and people watch it I remember after I did one in my family's like what are they watching I said here I'll play it for you and you know it's horrible watching yourself on there and I think why does anybody watch this you know who in their right mind would be spending two hours listening to this but they do and so as long as I keep getting emails from people which I do every day you know oh wow I'm so glad you're doing this this is really helping me I don't know that they could tell me how it's helping them which is kind of a crazy thing but they feel a sense of these are our mental minions doing their work back there and they're saying this is this is helping me enough that I'm motivated to get to a computer and dig up your email and write you this message and I say if that's happening I'll keep doing it as long as it's helpful so so I do it cool thank you very much thank you my pleasure
