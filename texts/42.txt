[Music] so Heather for people who maybe don't know you so well you're Brett Weinstein's wife yeah you were also at Evergreen and the main reason I think that you were not as high-profile was that you were actually on sabbatical at the time the protest kicked off and looked this stuff that people have seen I also have a different personality it would have been less like me to to continue going into the hornet's nest but I was I was there in the shadows the whole way you know I read every single thing that he sent out before I send it out but yes I was on sabbatical I was doing a totally different thing blissfully for five months in the immediate run-up to to what happened I never green and what I find really fascinating is that you have a really strong lived experience of a lot of the a lot of people talk about this sort of force that they say at work in the media and in various places and that they're very worried about it but your story seems to me to be the the new plus ultra example of what can happen when this tendency gets completely out of control indeed I mean it really even with the attempts of the Evergreen administration to basically pretend that the story was the opposite of what it was and to hire PR to to to make that happen for a while it seemed to be working and people would say to us ah it didn't didn't happen the way you said it did you know there were never people with baseball bats you weren't chased out of your own home you know all of these things and increasingly people are saying well yes evergreen was bad but it's sort of a one-off thing and I would say you know I'm I'm horrified and dismayed and heartbroken and what happened but given that that's what was going on that campus I'm glad to know and to have been part of a couple that stood up and not be participating in it through be a silence I'd rather not be there even as much as I loved when it was functional than to be there under very false and authoritarian pretenses a lot of people say as you said evergreen was a one-off and this when you talk about this kind of threat your straw Manning you're kind of creating a bogeyman that doesn't exist what what is your impression of that having gone through the Evergreen experience and then seeing how the culture is at the moment it's only getting worse while it is also true that it is not a majority certainly no majority of students not a majority of faculty who are pushing this authoritarian ideology this groupthink but I would say that a majority of faculty are cowardly and probably so narrowly trained that they have convinced themselves that they don't themselves have the intellectual tools to assess what is going on when these little uprisings erupt as they do on most campuses to some degree that strikes me as anti intellectual the idea that oh that's you know this this phrase stay in your lane this is the most anti intellectual authoritarian phrase that that's emerging right now stay in your lane what since when do I have a lane like okay I was I was trained in a number of different things as it turns out like I'm apparently I'm actually allowed to talk about classical music because I was trained as a classical pianist but I don't I have very little interest in talking about that most days that's my lane and anything over in how society is erupting and falling apart is not actually no like absolutely not and in part and part I would say anyone who wants to be a broad thinker should be should feel entitled and is entitled to speak and think in particular and any topic they want but and you know this is my distinct bias but I think it is warranted evolutionary tools evolutionary thinking allow you access to thinking about just about anything with the exception of things like rocks and quirks alright rocks and quarks don't you know are not subject to the rules of evolution but otherwise everything else and pretty much everything that you've got around here was created by humans or modified by humans for our purposes and we ourselves are evolved and we are you know we are these very strange generalists and specialists who are also Apes and monkeys and primates and mammals and you know and reptiles and vertebrates and all these things and there's truth in each one of those layers and the fact that we're animals tells us for sure that we have that we are sexually reproducing and you know not all animals are but at their base animals are sexually reproducing we're sexual creatures that's what we are and when sex shows up in animals as it does across almost all of them there's two of them and so you know being able to talk from a scientific perspective and then go you know at one level narrow or narrower except once you get to humans then it explodes into this big thing again there is this there is a long history actually of the social sciences looking over at biology and going basically stay in your lane you can talk about chimps if you want to and bonobos and gorillas but that's it as soon as you get to humans you're not allowed and there are a lot of us over an evolution space who are saying nope nope no way because only with the tools of evolution are you going to be able to more fully understand what it is that we are and why we're why we're behaving the way we are and would you say that sex and gender is at the core of that conversation I don't know that it's at the core but it's one of it's one of the focal points for sure I think one of the major confusions at least if I run into and maybe that maybe this is just more about the particular conversations that I'm pulled into both because of my interests um because of what I've been speaking on but the confusion about sex and gender is particularly widespread it is put a particularly easy to politicize and almost there are so many different confusions possible and so many different ways that people willing to be angry about what is true and what they want to claim is not true that it's it's just it's ripe to be one of the epicenters of disagreement and sort of one of the one of the hills on which the battle for enlightenment values is being fought from the experience at Evergreen do you feel that certain doors have opened at the same time as other doors have closed yeah of course I mean we're sitting here right and and I've been sitting in a lot of rooms with a lot of people that I never would have met before and that's extraordinary and it's certainly nothing that the administration at Evergreen imagined would happen we're going to happen when they went rogue for that I'm grateful and Brett's and my world has expanded dramatically we have much less stability and financial security but we have much more possibility to do good in the world we were doing good with 25 or 50 students at a time for 15 years 16 years and that was amazing and through it we learned tools about engagement and actual teaching and actually reaching people that I don't think we could have learned anywhere else but in terms of reach the reach never grew right the reach continued to expand but that same incremental amount every year and I know many of those students are still my friends I'm in touch with even more of them and they're they're wonderful and I cherish them and that time but given that evergreen was going off the rails in the way that it was and it refused to be helped like it really actively refused to be helped we offered as many ways as we could think of I it would be foolish of me to be anything but grateful for many aspects of this new life and one of the doors that has opened is the intellectual dark web which has a door that's a new metaphor yeah what you're you're in the intellectual dark web according to the New York Times I guess well it's the return of truth yeah so what do you see the IDW as what's your frame for the early W I don't I haven't formalized a frame for it it feels like a true recognition of aggregation of individuals and ways of approaching intellectual disagreement and conversation that at the time that Barry Weiss wrote that article in May of 2018 many of us knew each other many of us didn't in terms of just the people that she names in that article you know to varying degrees and I still haven't met some of them we if you take those people as some they're just a named subset politically very diverse developmentally from a lot of different backgrounds how it is that they're making their mark in the world is pretty diverse all those may be somewhat less other a lot of podcasters among them and people interviewing and you know really having conversations as a way of making their way in the world which is maybe one of the unifying things about about what the IDW is to the degree that is a thing people who who engage ideas broadly and who are willing to sit down with ideas even when they don't feel that they have the background have the training have the authority it is it is very much of the moment I think and I hope that it remains of the moment the the clear hunger that there is for people to be simultaneously pointed in their critique with evidence to back up what they say or hypothesis tests with which you might assess whether or not what I'm saying is true always with respect and compassion and a refusal to conflate the individual with the argument I think is perhaps the right encapsulation of what what the group is there for people in the group and you know many many many many others besides tend to reject orthodoxy tend to reject ideology tend to be interested in first principles thinking meaning that if you you don't take something on faith you try to figure out if that's true what else must be true let me see how far back I can go in the logic tree and see what basic assumption sits at the floor of that such that if I have to start questioning this thing here I've already done this backwards logic and I can as this starts to falter I can go back is this faltering - it's this faltering and maybe it's the assumption maybe it's the basic fundamental assumption of whatever it is that you believe and not all not all beliefs are subject to that there's some there's some that you just can't do that with some issues that really are questions of but I simply I simply do believe that it is immoral say to kill an unborn child I don't but you know that that will be a belief that some people hold and there's like what would the assumption be at the base of that I don't I don't find one right but addressing questions of what life is and what the barriers around life are like all of those questions can be assessed scientifically and being willing to go in and being willing you have to be excited but being willing to be wrong being willing to be publicly wrong even and to have to or to be very wrong in the moment not know it and come back and say screwed up looked into it or someone else revealed to me this is the thing that I thought because of these things and turns out no so that that is tough for most people to do for psychological reasons but it's also something that we have almost no experience seeing because politics doesn't allow politicians to ever do that which we've cooled before in our channel thinking in public yes it's almost an example of people thinking in public right people are very hungry for that as a phenomenon that's that's exactly right and politicians have been for some read I don't have an answer for it for this all that's probably pretty simple why aren't politicians allowed to think in public they are when they do they will of course make errors and they are just slaughtered right there disappeared so it is no accident that the people at least who very wise described in that IDW article and in general the sort of a larger amorphous group who identifies as such are mostly people who are not beholden to institutions there is this would be harder for me to do for Brett to do if we were still at Evergreen if we were still at the Evergreen of ten years ago which had complete academic freedom it would have been possible but today's evergreen not so much it's harder to do with any kind of employer who might be monitoring what it is that you do in the world your public persona and be concerned that others will conflate what you say with what they think I guess one of the reflex criticisms of the IDW the probably expected was its it's white men's protecting themselves which is a kind of reflex criticism that you often have from the left there aren't so many women in the IDW you're you're one of them do what do you make of that well so you said white and men and I think the answer is potentially different for those two criticisms you know there's there's no bigotry in any of these people whom I know and with varying degrees there's none it's just that's that's one of the things that does unifies as it does so many actually right if if you are worldly and you have spent time with enough different people whatever bigotry you did have fades so the lack the there's no there's not a lack but the somewhat lower racial diversity then then you would expect if it was just picked at random from the Earth's population I think does reflect past inequalities in opportunity for for some races and that so here's an anecdote when I was a TA when I was in graduate student in graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor I taught a lot of intro bio classes that were basically hoops for pre-meds and sometimes I got pre-vet someone's got pre-nursing very occasionally I got students who said they wanted to be scientists very rarely and I loved them they were more curious on average and it was a not very racially diverse student body um in the 90s but it was somewhat diverse and I remember talking not at my instigation to a few of my black students one year about why they were pre-med and not prescience though that's a term and they said look I hope I hope this changes soon but at this point my family I'm the first of my family to go to college and they are taking financial risks to allow me to be here and I cannot take the kinds of risks that being a scientist entail being a doctor at that point not so much anymore given what's happened at the American healthcare system but being a doctor was a pretty good guarantee of a very good income and what these that turns out these were all men but these these few young black men anecdote but said to me and I then asked a few other students over the years and I got the same some answers back was we don't have the kind of resource to to fall back on for me to follow what might or might not be my passion I haven't even really thought about it I'm going to be a doctor so that may be part of what is is going on with regard to to race with regard to sex you know there's no sex isn't a lineage like race to some degree is unlike an african-american family that is sending their first child to college there is no family of all women who are sending their first woman to college that's not how it works obviously so you know down to the ages so we it's not possible at that's explanation weather guard to imagined discrepancy isn't the expected sex ratio in the IDW is this how I would say it is the biologist anytime these claims of a gender gap come up I my brain goes to why do you expect the sex ratio in the particular population they're looking at to be one-to-one just because the population is one-to-one does not mean that this self-selected group is going to be one-to-one because guess what on average men and women are different we have different aptitudes even but let's just put that aside like there there is evidence in some regards and a you know with regard to general intelligence not so much but you know there's there's a lot of varied stuff over in terms of what particular aptitudes men and women have that are different you know women tend to be more about language and text and men tend to be more about math and spatial reasoning that research put it aside for a moment let's just talk about preferences which frankly probably emerged from underlying aptitudes but just preferences in the most gender equal countries out there in the Scandinavian countries you see people going more and more two more gender traditional roles they are doing everything they can to try to get rid of gender traditional expectations and people are freed from expectations pursuing them even more so you know famously James d'amour and the Google memo claimed not that women can't code for God's sake he never said that he said and he cited literature that has stood I'm not very long test of time but stood the test of time that actually women seem to prefer this kind of work less than men do and and that just that seems to be the case so I think that women on average probably prefer risky conversation less than men do and that sounds that sounds like it's going to be a problem but it you know in if it's true it may be a little bit ugly but sometimes truth is ugly I would say that two things that we know from the psychological literature which could be overturned but these things have stood the test of time or that let's see on the big five personality test the personality trait that is agreeable Ness is very gendered women are on average much more agreeable than men are and all of the subcategories under agreeableness tonight which I remember at the moment women are more agreeable that would tend to make women on average less interested in getting involved in conversations where they were they should expect to be challenged and were expected to give challenge it's not a particularly agreeable position it's uncomfortable right I would say also that the Asch experiment from the late fifties early sixties and princeton one of the mid-century psych experiments that that were famous and stood the test of time the conformity experiments in which at that at the point that he did it was all Princeton male undergrads who were asked without going into the details of the experiment to describe how long a line was compared to other lines when there were seven I think Confederates who answered before them wrongly and 75% I think of the subjects in the original experiment conformed to a patently factually wrong answer some of the time not very many people conformed all the time but 75% I think that's the number conformed some of the time which is a really large number so the ash experiment has been redone many times in many different settings including now of course with women because this was you know one of the very real things that we are emerging from not too long ago where women were not included in a lot of medical and psychological experiments to the detriment of women's health frankly when these experiments have been redone including women the result is uncomfortable but it's been repeated and it's that women conform it and even higher rate than men women conform to social pressure to agree to wrong things at a higher rate than men do I think that agreeableness and over in the big five personality index whenever it's called and conformity as measured by the ash experiment are a highly coupled concepts and I don't know I don't know if there's a psychological literature comparing them but they strike me as very similar and perhaps because of women's greater tendency to conform to social norms and perhaps because of women's tendencies to be somewhat more agreeable than men the kinds of engagement that occur by the people whom Barry Weis profiled and a large very much larger number of people who are seeking truth even when it hurts maybe at least at first more the purview of men and women now that everyone isn't invited and encouraged but the Preferences underlying where you go are different and what are those areas that are now really hot topics well sex that one's still on no one's off yep there are a lot the the ones that are getting the most play at the moment are so that the demographic ones that the authoritarian left is yelling about a lot and yes there are some dog whistles to the authoritarian right but that's a smaller group and pretty much pretty much society-wide we don't approve of what goes on on the authoritarian right and that leaves the vast majority of conservatives going like we disavow those guys but but we're here the ninety-eight percent of us are here and then on the left the authoritarian left the ones who are actually yelling is a tiny percentage but the things that they are saying that are threatening to become the new orthodoxy and that now increasingly large numbers of the left even those who don't who if they just thought about it a little bit they would realize they don't agree with these things are questions of sex and gender what sex is questions about religion and religious tolerance and whether or not we should be allowed and able and actually should be should be asking all the same questions of every religion if we you know especially on the left people sort of pride themselves on being secular and it's become it's become very fashionable to hate on Christianity and to love on Islam and why are we not applying the same kinds of critiques to any religion that's out there of course are there differences between races is a dangerous dangerous topic but to the extent that races represent real populations that have had separate histories of breeding of course there are differences will one be able to be seen as better than another better what's better better in what context better how better for what thing my feeling is as an evolutionary biologist of course not not better for modernity but different if there's actually like if there are if there are racial if there are real races which is increasingly not the case anymore then of course there will be differences just like there are differences on average between men and women which don't worse don't reflect a lineage the same way races do you know the the actual the actual stuff we should be talking about like the actual existential threat stuff like AI and energy and climate change and you know nuclear nuclear everything war and energy together somehow barely ranks on the list of what's being yelled at over here which makes it seem really non-organic at some level because where are all the actual important conversations like why aren't we talking about the things that actually matter and if we can get through well I don't know if it's the next 40 years help us something next for but you know four years 40 years a hundred years if humanity's still here in a hundred years we are going to have fixed most of these problems or we're not going to be here I mean it feels like we're we're at this point on so many of these issues almost none of them being the ones that we're talking about all the time but it's those it's those of sort of enforced tolerance of crazy views on sex and gender and religion and race and oh yeah there must be others but you know all of you know everything in the progressive stack right but you know we have to pretend that bodyweight has no effect on health do we really yeah that's where we are that's one of the big issues no we don't and we're gonna move on we're not gonna move on you have held us hostage so two things right there's a bunch of conversations we should be having and some people are still but mostly we're stuck over here talking about actually no we're gonna stand for science and say there's differences there are differences between men and women trans is real rare and a lot of people currently claiming to be trans aren't to that thing and trans man and man aren't the same a thing not the same thing because a lot of these topics have become toxic on the left the only place because we can say well no one's talking about this no one's talking about this and then you you can look at the fact that these are being widely talked about on the right they've been widely talked about online so it's not true that no one's talking about them but the fact that they're not being talked about in the left in the media in these kinds of institutions is a big problem because suddenly the only people who are talking about not but are possibly people who don't have who may have some bigotry they're they're made the conversation may go toxic so I guess it's good to kind of define that sometimes yeah so the right you know there are amazing numbers of good and honorable and smart people on the right and I knew that I mean I I had friends on the right before this but I have a lot more now and I've heard from a lot more and the fact is that we both the left should want a smart and educated right and the right should want a smart and educated left and and certainly the right hasn't had that for a while that said there are different ways to define what makes you a liberal versus a conservative or left or right but one of the fundamental ways that I think is pretty standard to define the differences is are you fundamentally interested in regulation for either systems that are too big for individuals to regulate or to help people who have gotten the raw the stick if you are if you are if you're a pro regulation at some level then you're over in left space and so even imagining that we've excluded that tiny percentage of the right that are actually bigots and nasty and don't have the best interest of all of humanity at heart and you take the remaining whatever it is 90 plus percent for sure the fact is we do disagree about real things right the left and the right disagree about the well first the level of actual inequality remaining in the world which is part of what the far left is screaming about but more to the point for right now left and right disagree on what we should do about it and in general what the right has seen is boy do does the left not recognize unintended consequences of regulations and because we can't know we better just not let's just let's just let these systems go and the market will take care of it and people on the left are much more likely to say yes absolutely and precautionary principle please but we're gonna have to regulate some things that individual individuals and unregulated markets simply can't simply can't fix so you know we need we need all the reasonable people on both sides to try to shut down the bigots on their on their extremes the right has its bigots the left has its bigots and the left pretends that they're anti bigots but it's they're bigots all the same and start having the conversations that [Music] you [Music]
