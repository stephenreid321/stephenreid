I really feel that there is this collective subconscious rage that is just boiling in women and it's coming up in so many ways we see we see in the media and what's going on is this unknown rage that comes up in in many different ways and on one hand it needs to come out we need to clear it it needs to be expressed it needs to be acknowledged on the other hand it's not enough this is only like this is breaking the ice so that the next step of evolution can you know consciousness can start coming through and that's what I'm lacking in women it's really to take responsibility for what we do as women in our manipulation in our seduction in our control and and it's so easy for women to say but that's just because we're angry and mended this and patriarchy but it's it's such a lack of responsibility and this women really need to know because we could say we could look at say me too which has been kind of ongoing for a long time and as still a massive force and we can say that it's it's brought up a lot of male shadows it's brought showing up a lot of male behavior that is just inexcusable should not happen and it's it's certainly you could say started as a positive thing but then you also have like there's there's perhaps a danger of its slipping into a very simplistic narrative of men as only aggressors women as only victims is that something that you're worried about I'm very worried about that because what it feels like is it has displayed the male shadow but who talks about the female shadow the rage that that women are expressing blindly and projecting onto which ever situation and which ever men that they can this is not an empowered woman this is not the empowered feminine this is the underbelly of feminism this is when feminism goes wrong this is not the few it's not the future to blame and to project and to persecute you explain what you mean a bit more about when feminism goes wrong when feminism goes wrong we allow the collective rage to act out through us so we see every situation we see every man we see every encounter with the lens of of the victim and we're so angry about it and it's it's boiling in every woman it's right under the surface so she will quickly snap if if this if there's a reason or if there's an apparent reason because it's so strong it hasn't discharged it's in the collective and that rage needs to discharge but it needs to discharge in an intelligent way not in an unconscious way and you said before that that rage is often directed at men not showing up I'd say it's it's two-way because yes it's it's targeted at men not showing up or they are causing it but it's very often projected out to men that are actually trying to show up that is actually engaging in with will engaging with women and actually talking about these things so that's that's because then we bring up this topic and then it's so easy for women to tap into that collective pool of rage and it just comes out this is this is where women need to step up and take responsibility and stop blaming men it's pointless we need to transcend this we can't solve this we can't solve this problem from the steps from the same level we need to transcend and look at how am i adding to this dynamic as a woman because we are we are co-creating it in perfect harmony if women are angry we absolutely need to take responsibility for getting ourselves to another place if you want a more direct experience of some of the topics in this film rebel wisdom is running workshops for men to grow up and show up more in the war check the website for more great films such as the first full-length documentary on jordan peterson and for details of our upcoming events [Music] you
