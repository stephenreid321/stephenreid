[Music] hey guys this is a short intro to a series that we're putting out about psychedelics and it's just so happen that we've ended up with about three pieces at the same time around the same topic and this we just want to do a little bit of an intro to it I think it's also interesting to link psychedelics to what we've talked about on the channel before because I think the link is maybe not immediately obvious but a lot of the people we've had on have talked about the crisis in meaning so the meaning crisis which you could see as a kind of meta crisis that is influencing all aspects of our lives and a big part of the meaning crisis as well is the crisis how do we make sense of the world how do we find truth how do we communicate with each other how do we trust each other psychedelics are really important I think because they can break people out of fixed small tunnelled cognitive traps one of the reasons are so good therapeutically and they can help us to step back from our own ideology and have that space and to be able to think more flexibly if they're used correctly and they're not always used correctly but they have that potential genuinely to break us out of these tribal eyes ideological camps that we're in now where we can't talk to each other there's no good faith conversation we're not meeting each other fully from a place of genuine interest and you know trying to get somewhere together psychedelics have that potential but that requires a lot of work and a really solid framework around them and we don't really have that yet yeah it's fascinating that this psychedelic Renaissance is happening in the middle of this meaning crisis and I think the two are definitely linked you can go back to the sort of really high profile debates between Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and you could argue that's about the meaning crisis as well but how do we make sense of the world do we need it do we need a religious framework to do so the one thing that they do agree on is the value of psychedelics or the importance of psychedelics Sam Harris has written a lot about how meaningful he's found a psychedelic experiences Jordan Peterson hasn't talked openly about his own psychedelic experience has been he has at the core of his maps of meaning lecture is a lot of talk about the value of psychedelics the importance of psychedelics the fact that they show there is the mystery of consciousness there is this experience that materialist science has no idea how to process whatsoever but can be very meaningful very very therapeutic and it's it's also replicable and as an expert is an experience of the mystery the divine or something that can be reliably replicated in people and we have no not even any framework for so regular viewers to the channel might know that this is something that we've both been interested in for quite a while I've done pieces about it for the BBC and for Channel 4 News going back about first one was in about 2008 so I've been following this story for quite a while what's really interesting about the films were putting out now is that there feels like there's a real shift so for a while that the enthusiasm was about psychedelic the psychedelic Renaissance that these substances were being used as medicines somehow the films that we're putting out are a little bit more cautionary there are but I think that reflects where the conversation is at right now among people in the psychedelic community who are still very enthusiastic about the potential of psychedelics for medicine and for cultural transformation but are also feeling like well we've got to be careful here and I think we'll talk about the different areas of that but maybe we'll talk a little bit about our kind of backgrounds first yeah so around the same time you were covering that for the BBC I wrote a novel around psychedelics and it was a you know I'd say psychedelics one of the most formative things in my development into my life and as I had an article in The Guardian which got some really angry comments actually underneath it at the time it also 2009 and then I'm one of the organizers of a conference called breaking Convention which happens every two years it's around psychedelic science and culture it's been growing and growing as well so my own personal trajectory has also been one of extreme excitement into extreme caution and then up into kind of a hopeful excitement but tempered with caution because I've seen I've seen lots of different ways people have used psychedelics lots of ways they've used them that would have been better they never taken them at all I've seen a lot of ways in which it has not impacted the culture like it like they could have and so there is I think I'm probably not the only one in you know in the community who feels like that around them so putting out three pieces one is called magic medicine question mark asking the question whether they are whether they can be used effectively as medicines so there's been a lot of research done in the UK in London at Imperial College around psilocybin - the active ingredient in magic mushrooms being used for depression and the idea being that it can get us out of rumination it can get us out of habitual ways of thinking that a characteristic of depression and a camera crew was allowed into the end of the first pilot study and captured the experience of three people and what's interesting about that film is that it shows a very mixed picture a very mixed picture so it's it's something of a cautionary tale and so we've got some clips from that film and then an interview with the director and with the psychologist who led many of the sessions were sitting in there with the the participant at the end of the day when they're talking through their experience you're left with this profound sense of respect for the process but that person's unconscious mind was somehow able to take them on this journey back towards some kind of health or a journey with a step in the direction of balance and health we've also got a piece with Gabor maté a course psychedelic therapy we then got an interview with Jamie Weil who we've had them at the channel before expert in flow States and he he's really sounding the alarm on where the psychedelic Renaissance is at right now and the dangers of big pharma coming in of narcissistic kind of the dark side of psychedelics had can lead to narcissistic inflation and he's pretty much saying he thinks that the psychedelic Renaissance is headed off he's pretty clear about that he says that the the forces in play already are unstoppable and that's where that's where it's going and then also gabble Matt a the Canadian doctor who works a lot with addiction and he talks about how it can be used how psychedelics can be used to treat addiction I think I'm actually far more pessimistic and concerned actually in ways that I didn't even anticipate coming out of stealing those are just the factors I'm watching you know and and and I would imagine that I mean a they're all already happening so none of this is sort of you know Cassandra you know magining worse scenarios and saying well what if that happens these are all already happening the question is just where do they lead us I think it's really interesting Jamie's points you know when I listen to them resonated a lot because they he talks about this kind of psychedelic narcissism and this kind of Instagram efficacious of the psychedelic experience and people are like hey I'm in Peru drinking ayahuasca and I'm there's just the lack of structure and the lack of integrity that a lot of people working with those plants are showing and it's just what what struck me is that psychedelics traditionally and through shamanism are so different in the way they were used to the kind of mimimi narcissism culture you know it was very much a case of like a big part of the psychedelic experiences is being able to sit with pain and to be able to go through an experience that is not glamorous that is not something you want to share that is actually traditionally been sacred so you don't share it around it's even the illusion in mysteries which used to happen in ancient Greece were you know they almost certainly used a psychedelic substance you weren't allowed to talk about it at all with anyone and the one one man was you know there's a record of someone doing it in his house for his friends and that was like punishable by death you know so just the sheer contrast of how psychedelics have been used and what Jamie wheel is talking about with this narcissistic appearance only culture is is a bizarre state of affairs to be in so I think we've both had this sense for quite a while of when is it going to break through come more mainstream and feeling oh it's now it's now it's now and it definitely has now and we're in the middle I think everyone would acknowledge we're in the middle of the psychedelic Renaissance if the original psychedelic wave was the 1960s we're back in the Renaissance and I think the the publication of Michael Pollan's book how to change your mind was a big moment there but the conversation has definitely shifted and now the conversation is are we in danger of replicating some of the mistakes of the 1960s where we had this huge exuberance around it and then the though the dark side of psychedelics came in more and more and it became increasingly undeniable as to that dark side we realized as one of the the people in in the films we were putting out talks about them they are nonspecific amplifiers and this is something a lot of enthusiasm at psychedelics don't necessarily acknowledge they're not they will amplify anything that you're feeling and by definition they will amplify everything in the culture as well and it's not it's not necessarily just a positive thing I mean I think it's good to also step back about forty thousand years to the original psychedelic Renaissance arguably was you know there was a big shift in human beings and our capacity to make art make culture and some have linked that to increase use of psychedelics then even John robic he has talked about this a couple of times as well that role psychedelics have played in our development as a species and it's very rare that psychedelics are just in the entire culture it's really rare john vivec he talks about this really well around you know still tended to be only a few people were taking them though the shaman would take the psychedelics and be able to tap into a different way of seeing be able to connect patterns together that no one else could and go hey the Bison are moving that way tomorrow people have the hel as you know that because he knows shaman actually means he who knows or she he or she even knows person who knows so you have access to some information but not everyone had access to the information so at the risk of putting on a very very unpopular opinion I've come to the conclusion not conclusion but I wander often whether psychedelics should ever become mainstream or whether they should be used after training like you know we don't let everyone is drive a car who wants to or pilot a plane there's a training process that is involved in that and that's the way it's been for a very very long time in fact that's the way we figured out as a species how to use to academics safely so that's an open question for me are we playing with fire so if you look back at the 60s and the first sort of psychedelic wave you see this incredible level of creativity you see the level of but the music that came out at the time was heavily influenced by it it was this kind of liberation of creative energy for sure I also question whether they are playing exactly the same role as they did in the past and there's a sort of a sense of there were there are a lot of kind of mental straitjackets to break out of in the 60s that I'm not entirely sure are the same nowadays and what I've perceived in the psychedelic community is a lot of actually a lot of groupthink a lot of very very similar perspectives like the idea that there's a kind of narrative in a psychedelic community which is yeah everyone else is following this kind of corporate programming and free your minds with psychedelics and then you'll be kind of be able to see through the patterns you'll be able to see what's really going on which tends to degenerate into outright conspiracy theory a lot of the time like huge amounts of conspiracy conspiratorial thinking within the psychedelic community and very similar conspiratorial thinking as well which is sort of I think is is mostly a projection of sort of internal stuff out into the world unresolved internal stuff out into the world but also even the there's very little political diversity in the psychedelic community nowadays which if psychedelics were kind of had the effect of freeing our minds you would expect more diversity not less whereas I think what it often does is becomes a bit an induction into it into a way of thinking about the world that seems very it's another form of groupthink yeah and and that there's a phrase that psychedelics are nonspecific amplifiers from stanislav grof and if you are in an environment that is a certain way and you take a psychedelic it you know has a certain amount of preconceptions about the experience has a certain political leaning is most likely that that will be enhanced in you so it can create a certain filter bubbles very powerfully I mean it's also an open question for me this point about political diversity I don't think I've met maybe 0.1% of the people I've met the psychedelic community are not quite left-leaning I mean it's really like it's almost impossible to find someone who isn't so that is that begs the question of okay either it's that point I just laid out that is free self reinforcing or is there something about the psychedelic experience itself that lends itself to for example social constructivism which which arguably it could in a certain context because the psychedelic experience does deconstruct and does give you the sense of there's multiple different narratives and frameworks and I can kind of see which is true anyway but also that if that's not tempered by kind of grounding in truth it can just go haywire into what you're just talking about conspiracy theory groupthink and unfortunately that's where I've seen it going so yeah we're putting out films about psychedelics they're all a bit of a downer and but I think that's where the conversation is at right now I think it is that is pretty much the cutting edge of the conversation there's still a lot of enthusiasm and potential for psychedelics that a lot of people in the community are feeling but increasingly I think many of the people in the psychic community I'm aware of are kind of feeling a little concerned about some of the ways that things are going yeah and rightly so and this is a natural part of the process as something goes through a revival then all of the shadow material I think as well all the dark side of it also needs to be looked at and I think it's essential because they are they are incredible substances if use in the right way and they do have incredible potential but I think everyone who's involved with them needs to kind of show up and grow up around them so we'll be putting up the other films over the next few days and do enjoy them comment on them let us know what you think and see you soon [Music] you
