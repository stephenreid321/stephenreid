it's a pretty good time if you wanted to start a religion now would be a great time thought must have crossed your mind if you were to claim since no one's done it very plausibly for a while but if you were to claim that that you had yourself dipped the bucket right down into the well and brought up a bucket full of the real thing you could do quite well these days and my own view is that were quite lucky that some total charlatan and hasn't come along with enormous power already to do that maybe it's less possible in the modern Information Age that would have been even in the time of the founder of Mormonism but let alone in what used to be called the age of the prophets but it's always there isn't it and and and if you have things like massive societal upheaval or war or catastrophic events we're all totally available it's terrifying
