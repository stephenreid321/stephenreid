hi everybody and welcome to the rebel wisdom podcast so it's about a month since we did the last podcast it's been a really busy month a lot of content new content coming up in the channel and there's been a kind of common theme emerging which is the shadow what we're going to talk about today we did this the interview with Zen master talking about Jordan Peterson in the shadow which has had like been really successful it's had about 80,000 views and loads of comments but really polarized people either seem to love it or hate it which is fantastic it's a really interesting phenomena in itself and we did a whole series of films about Jordan Peterson and the left and the kind of sub title of that or the the subtext of that was pretty much the shadow of the left what is the left not seeing about itself what is it not integrating and to move forward and what does it need to do to recover and be a healthy part of the political dialogue which is another really important part of yeah that that's kind of hat what the shadow looks like of a wider cultural level and I guess the Zen monk is like the personal shadow so we'll go into that and we're also going to go through some of the content we've got coming up there's some stuff that I'm really excited about they're gonna be starting to put up next week and we already put up quite a few extra interviews on mostly for patrons so if you're supporting us on patreon great you can go to our patreon site and already view that if not please do consider supporting us because then you'll get access to all of this great material and also help us make more of the films that hopefully you enjoy if you're watching this I'm assuming you enjoy them and we've also got a live event in London on the 18th of September that we are calling the Great Awakening I guess we've got a few sort of new subscribers so maybe you're not familiar with with the kind of the theme of this channel but we're looking at the Jordan Peterson phenomena we're looking at the intellectual darkweb phenomena and the Internet as a whole as unlocking this great intellectual awakening online and we're gonna be taking that out into the real world in September the 18th of September in Brick Lane in London and we're going to put the details of that below the video here yeah so talking about Jordan Peterson and the intellectual dark web I think a lot of the response and a lot of the impetus for people really connecting with that is because these conversations are pointing out shadows in our culture so they're pointing out the shadow of progressive culture the shadow of the left in particular because a big aspect of shadow work which a few people have also asked us about is that when we have a shadow basically is any part of yourself that you reject and cut off from the rest of yourself so for example if I said to myself I'm not an angry person every time I had a natural anger response I kind of suppress it and you put it down into the basement of your psyche and then but you don't get rid of it because you can because it's you so you start projecting it out into the world and then it looks like everyone else is angry and you're wondering well why is everyone always a lying ground never hangry I'm better than that and so you're actually seeing a mirror of yourself through other people and but you're still acting angry you be in that case probably passive-aggressive so that really that is happening on a cultural level there's a kind of hypocrisy within the culture of not owning for example progressive culture not being as progressive or tolerant as it claims to be I think was a big part of the impetus for a lot of the conversations that are happening now and it's there has a hidden tribalism that it has a hidden it is as bigoted in some ways as the things that it's protesting against exactly yeah and it's the same from the individual level it's this you know this person the person I was just describing who suppressed their anger they are just as angry as the angriest person they just haven't owned it and so part of part of shadow work is going doe Sheen talked about this briefly with us is that we use this in our workshop is that the method called three to one which works really well so first isn't it it's the three it's like it's not me it's out there then it's the two so you have a dialogue with it so kind of communicate with an aspect of yourself in a way that's kind of dissociated from you and then the last stage is becoming it and that this is that that's I think the stage that scares people both individually and collectively is that oh but if I if I accept the fact that I'm angry what's to stop me going out and murdering loads of people and of course that's not what happens when when you integrate the shadow you become more whole and it's a very specific feeling of being more psychologically whole but also having more self-respect you know Peterson talks about that actually in the interview in truth and time of chaos it's you kind of you own your potential for havoc and you're like a martial artist you have control of yourself it's not leaking out sideways to everyone it's it's within you and on an individual level it's totally crucial but also in the collective level as well yeah it's kind of that level of integration that I think again he said in that interview if you it's either under your control or it has you you have it or it has you those are the options yeah the question is kind of how do you find the shadow as well and in your life it's someone that you have a reaction that's out of proportion to the this stimulus by that person and it's someone who's just like oh I cannot stand that person for whatever reason it's usually a good sign that oh yeah there's a part of me that I'm not owning in that and which brings us quite nicely onto the fact that the dosha interview was about the shadow and created some of the most polarizing reactions I think I've ever seen from an interview it's kind of equally split and I have private messages from people as well some people saying that's the best interview you've ever done it's it's amazing he's so profound and other ones saying I felt physically ill when I watched him and this is this is wonderful in a way it's really fascinating to see that this one interview could create such different responses and then if you looked at the comments it was exactly the same he's a fraud he's a charlatan together with he's like the Dalai Lama it's like this is this is really fascinating and I would also hope that as we kind of move forward what we're hoping to do is to create a kind of dialogue that moves beyond just those reactions that incorporates those reactions like they they're useful that value of valuable information to know this is how I felt when I saw this and maybe those reactions were right maybe is a fraud I don't know I spend a few hours with him I liked him I'm fascinated as to what's what's behind these reactions but yeah it's like can we get to a place where we can acknowledge those reactions and then hold them a bit lightly and say this is how I felt when I saw this but maybe it's saying something about me as much as it's saying something about that other person and obviously a youtube comment section is pretty much the shadow in in in Internet form and we we get sucked into this very binary kind of way of looking at the world do we like this we not like this this right is this wrong and I guess we're trying to kind of encourage it a form of dialogue and a way of looking at the world that goes a little bit beyond that and says there is this this is the reaction I had but there's some value in it as well and because I think even yeah that whatever you thought of that interview I think there's some gold in there there's some real gold in what he was saying and I know that you know quite a bit more than I do about Zen and what how kind of ironic it is that this this created the reaction that it did yeah it's kind of perfect in some ways because SoDo Chien comes from Rinzai Zen which is quite a kind of challenging form of Zen it's like samurai Zen it's the hard core form that uses cones so cones are like these little logic bombs basically like there's no such thing as time so what does memory and the teacher would give that to the steel what was your original face before you were born yes yeah or like in the end of the interview what is the sound of one hand clapping it's this by the way yeah we that one we sold there's only like a hundred more cones to go yeah and the point of a cone is basically to destroy the egos capacity to make sense in then you fall you surrender so much of a Zen is about letting go there's a lovely phrase I think from Dogen who was a Zen master called Zen is like opening the hand of thought so you're grasping and it relates to the shadow cuz you're grasping on to identity for example in that anger example it's like identity is not an angry person so you're grasping onto that and through practice you learn how to open it up and then you realize that there was nothing you were holding on to so I always describe it as letting go of holding on so how that relates to something like the DOE Sheen interview is that a I think it's it's great because it kind of doesn't matter whether doe she is like some kind of mystic or a total fraud if you're looking at it in terms of what can I learn about my own reaction to this how can I you know using it as a mirror in a sense and also it's it's great because people in R in zazen they tend to challenge so like a Cohen is like a total it's a challenge and in a lot of the Zen stories they would give a Cohen and the student goes off for like sorry Japanese so it's like the certain amounts of time it's like six months they're sitting on the mouthing like well there's the sound of one hand clapping and they come back to the master and they had this whole like philosophical thing and the Masters like no you're wrong off and they're gonna get it and they go back to another three years and then eventually like they're like fifty years old and the masters like old and gray and they're like okay they give one more answer in the masters like now you're wrong go away you're wasting my time and then eventually they're like oh god I give up and then they're like yes you got it and that's you know it's a tricky it's a tricksters he describes himself as a troublemaker actually doshi and it is a troublemaker trickster form of Zen so in a way I'm kind of surprised by the reaction but also I'm not I'm not that surprised in retrospect if I think about that tradition of Zen yeah so in a way I guess it's that he's not there to make you feel comfortable yeah quite the opposite and the fact that so many people felt uncomfortable watching it is actually quite fascinating and and also as you said I don't know whether they're right or the other people are I don't know which side is right even having spent time with him still don't know and yeah that the kind of yes that's another thing of Zen you know there's a lot there's a there's a really famous Zen phrase if if you see the Buddha on the road kill him you know it's it's not about another person telling you how to live your life it's about you finding it's kind of a Gnostic thing you you find the wisdom within yourself this kind of special knowledge that is all experiential and there's a lot of inner sovereignty that comes with that it's interesting you just mentioned Gnosticism because we also put out an interview with Tim Freak just a few days ago which yeah I found really interesting I really liked his framing of the Christian story and the pagan story as being connected rather than being being in opposition to each other yeah it's also been a little bit polarizing that interview between I guess literalist interpretations of the Bible and the more Gnostic interpretations which are more based around kind of what I was talking about a moment ago direct experience of the divine not that that doesn't exist in Christianity but I would say that in lots of forms of modern Christianity the practices used don't create mystical experiences like taking communion doesn't give you a saw like taking acid for example it's a really different experience so yes it's also an interesting debate a little bit like the science and Christianity debate it's not one that I think is easily solved but it again is an opportunity for a kind of generative discussion if people want to have it around around their beliefs I guess and before that we also put out the the whole series about Jordan Peterson the left which was kind of subtitled the shadow of the left and my my friend Andrew Sweeney who I'm hoping to catch up with again soon he's done quite a few pieces for us and writes quite a lot about the Jordan Peterson phenomena online and he he made this really interesting connection which is to the archetypal Jordan piece and talks about the archetypal quite a lot and he he drew the link between so on on the right we have the tyrannical father like the danger of the right is the tyrannical father the but the danger on the left is the kind of the archetype of the devouring mother it's the caring instinct that then goes too far and ends up stopping the development of our own children so it does not allow it is so interested in taking care of people that it doesn't allow people to actually develop I thought was a really interesting archetypal framework to look at it because that ultimately is I think the shadow of the left yeah and I wonder if even that archetype contains a shadow within it it's like the for me the devouring mother has a sense of well why why is an archetype dark or why is it unresolved like in literature it's usually because there is some ego issue with that character that that's why they're the bad guy like Macbeth has a lust for power and that's his fatal flaw there they all have a fatal flaw and I wonder if in a way that the fatal flaw within that devouring mother archetype is that is trying to resolve its own issues through the outside it's like if I care my mother and care so much then I will be whole in some way there's for me there feels like there's a projection in that as well and that's something I noticed some often in what people would call I guess the regressive left it's like like I care deeply about other people and I'm so I'm so passionate I'm so compassionate but actually that compassion comes with a weird edge or there's something required for it it's not given freely and lovingly it's it's got a kind of edge to it it's also a kind of tribal compassion yeah because it assumes that other people don't have compassion whereas when you look at sort of politics a bit more open-minded Lee you see that often there's no sort of division between the amount of compassion that's felt like on the right compassion is generally focused mostly on the family and then the the immediate community in the nation-state whereas on the left it's sort of more Universal compassion and I think it's wrong to see any one of those as more advanced than any other because I think the mistake on the left is to assume that the it confuses rights and responsibilities because we we may have we may all have universal human rights and all be deserving of love and respect and it doesn't necessarily follow that we have equal responsibilities to everybody and the responsibilities in any practical sense can only ripple out from our immediate communities into the into the wider world and I don't think my mom is the best mom in the world because I think she's superior to all other people but I think that because she's my mom and that's the relationship I have with my mom and everyone should feel like that about their mom I mean there's a real category error on the left when those things get confused and that's where we start getting into what I think of fairly crazy ideas like we should do away with borders why the fact that I was born in some place should I have more rights to stuff than than other people and then suddenly you're into this very swamp like place where there is no meaning there was no meaningful attachment to place there was no meaningful attachment to a personal lived experience of being in a certain place and and suddenly you're in yeah that that's where I think the left starts to go too far and I think that the the shadow of tribalism on the left saying we're not tribal but we're really tribal I think it gets projected into the ideology rather than the traditional tribal matrix which would be the the family expanding out to the tribe and then I guess at some point it was the nation-state but yeah so it's the ideology and the tribe at the same time yeah because they create an unacknowledged tribe yes the left creates a tribe of people who think like us that they then refused to admit it actually a tribe but you know if you've ever been in those environments if you start saying things that don't fit with the with that worldview you will find yourself excluded as police by language I mean really really carefully police but there's almost like a language a linguistic code to it I think it's that which is where that idea of virtue signal name comes from which I think people on on well I don't know saying on the left is a bit misleading but let's say in that kind of environment people who aren't fully owning their shadow I think it really triggered by the phrase virtue signaling it seems to be one of the things that really gets in there and just to return to kind of finish off that the shadow idea is that doe Sheen and quite a lot of the other kind of people we've spoken to talked about shadow work as being the essential work for getting it out of the current postmodern mess because the only way to get out is for people to recognize that they are the thing that they're protesting against that they are projecting out onto the world exactly the thing that they think that they're fighting against the tribalism the judgmentalism the bigotry all of those things are in some sense hardwired but also can only be transcended and included once they've been acknowledged yeah that's a question of humility for humans that like for people to have humility and get away from this idea of like I'm the good guy in there the bad guys you know Carl Jung said when when people I'm paraphrasing obviously but when people really get down into the shadow they realize I'm not as good a person as I thought I was and it's just like that simple it's like doshi and said you have to feel really uncomfortable that's when you know you're really on your edge and looking at an aspect of yourself that is so difficult to own the shadow by definition if it was easy just do it like that it can take it can take years even after identifying it to make that leap in the 3 to 1 method to make that leap to be like oh this is me but it's yeah I agree with I agree with that what he was saying it's it's what needs to happen everywhere I think so we've had a few people get in touch asking for practical tips on integrating the shadow and I think your the idea of the 3 2 1 meditation is a really good one so look at something that triggers you in the outside world then effectively realize that yeah that's me yeah and we also run workshops for men and women and shadow work is a huge part of both of them so for details on those check on our website and look at the dude helps in the show notes below we've also got some really interesting content now up on patreon taking this a little while after coming back from America to kind of edit it and get it up but we have a really interesting discussion between Jordan Greenhalgh and a cure of the dawn Kara the dawn who people might know from jbp wave and Jordan greenhalgh who was in the glitch in the matrix film and is one of the most yeah really fascinating thinkers I'll play a clip of that now and so what's happening is that people are perceiving because it's becoming increasingly obvious that all of these artifacts of the way that we've gone about doing civilization in all the different ways like pick your poison is really matter because they're all kind of tied together are breaking down and failing in a way that is no longer easy to pretend isn't happening and so as a consequence this triggers a deep visceral sense and that's a good thing right because that deep visceral sense is the return to the aluminum the return to the mystery the return to the the state which by the way invokes this conversation human beings have encountered this problem before which isn't in kind of an imperative for us to transcend to the level we need to get to to become the species that we could be you need those kind of stakes who's it for hmm I like that in that direction and another new film called understanding the intellectual dark web with the two philosophers from the CIA is entering just entering into the underworld and it's a descent right it's the ditz the mythic descent into the underworld it's the dissolution it's we're feeling everything starting to shake and and buckle and it's like fractally all these lines of division it's like the center cannot hold and another few films up there including the behind the scenes with Jordan Peterson from a interview with him last year so yeah we're starting to do a kind of twin track of content we'll keep releasing stuff on the main YouTube channel but we're going to increasingly put up early content or exclusive content for patrons so if you enjoy the content and you want to help support it please do and you'll get access to all of this page for any content as well yeah and also if anyone wants to join the conversation at the wider conversation we have a pretty thriving discord chat going we'll put the link to it under here there's also now patron only discord to discuss the content that's up there on patreon but then also to ask questions for the QA but either way I think join the discord if you want to kind of have a really engaging discussion it's yeah it is constantly interesting and lots of announcements this week we have our first live event to talk about a lot of the ideas that we've raised in our films in London on the 18th of September again we'll put the details for it below the video in the show notes and yeah do come along if you're in London don't fly over for it's probably only that good if I ever pretty fly over or if you're in America it's gonna be that good and yeah see you soon
