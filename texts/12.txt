[Music] so Jordan you wrote a piece a situational assessment in the wake of the Trump election that went kind of viral and that's what I'd like to do is kind of recap some of what you've talked about in your latest one the 2019 and see whether the overview that you put forward at the time of the Trump election that it was gonna be a revolutionary or it was already a revolutionary war and that this was about the different phases of the insurgency versus the existing structure what you've called the blue church and if so where are we in that in that frame well I think it since I went ahead in 2018-2019 ask that question and answer that question in the affirmative I'm gonna go ahead and stick to my guns and say yes taking a look at the prevent I would just take the event of the Trump election and endeavouring to make sense of what was going on in the context that particular event I'm coming out of the perspective that it's it's taking place in a larger context so within that larger context I can take a look at what that particular ban say hmm there's some things that I noticed that I would like to point attention to and in that pointing attention to identified four things that are calling I was gone front so I used the metaphor of war and the proposition was that in fact it was really more than a metaphor that perhaps we're actually experiencing something that is a closer to war than say politics they have to reference your own closets to go deep on that notion so in the context of there being something akin to a war going on and what might that would look like identified four distinct fronts that if you were to watch those fronts you might get a better sense of what's happening and maybe even a better way of making choices of acting and the Front's had to do with one relationship was a relationship between the the media the the mass media and the emergent media another front had to do with the relationship to as I was calling the insurgency in the deep state the next front had to do with globalism and the relationship between globalism and what next question mark and then the last had to do with this conflict of the cultural level that I identified as being between something called the blue church and then something that I was naming the red religion and if you would call which I'm sure you do I sort of found those terms sitting out on a in Reddit and said those are really good terms from what's being described here and particularly like the nuance between Church and religion that many people sort of gloss over so if you walk down those fronts and they're obviously related to each other cuz it's a war so they're part of a larger complex if you look at the first front from 2016 to two contemporary I think it's not particularly obscure that it's a front that the notion of was the fake news as the enemy of the people is now there has been an explicit statement which wasn't in 2016 and that evolution has continued and the notion of there being a antipathy a natural intrinsic deep separation and conflict between something the mainstream media whatever we may consider that to be and something else this notion of the insurgency whatever may think that is I think is to be perfectly frank quite obvious there's certainly something going on there now that by itself may not be in fact fully disruptive but the notion that you started now get real salvos being fired across this divide and the degree to which the underlying legitimacy of the mainstream media has now been quite significantly undermined I mean I would say that the the amount of legitimacy that had in say Rush Limbaugh followers in the late 90s I think has moved into sort of 55% of the population like it's assumed to be biased deeply deeply biased with an agenda and now it's assumed to be biased and incompetent it's not a very solid foundation of how much to build something so I also predict that this war is more that's going to go this way now in the larger context of course the frame is that there's many many different things that are going on that are deeper than what we're seeing and that we if you look at the deeper stock to really make sense what's happening and one of the things that I pointed out in that in that particular series was this notion of media the way the different media generate different landscapes upon which these kinds of conflicts can occur in the metaphor of are you fighting in the desert are you fighting in the jungle and if a certain medium that produces jungles is replaced by a meeting that produces deserts then people who are optimized for jungle warfare gonna find themselves in a desert are gonna be in deep trouble right so just watch what's happening underneath and then see as the battle ships and the proposition of course is that a big piece of what's happening a very big piece after that's not the dominant these but a big piece is this transition between centralized broadcast linear media most notably television to decentralized symmetric oftentimes non linear or non what is it called not temporally continuous media ie what happens when you see on the internet the Internet has discontinuous news different better term for a synchronous asynchronous so when I'm watching a television program there's a flow to it that it's happening moment after moment and my ability think 1977 to go to the bathroom and come back I've missed something there's something that's happened is objectively in a flow whereas on the Internet of course that's not the case I just hit pause or even I just take clothes come back and hit open again right so there's a different thing going on there so you've got very very very distinct underlying media topographies and these give rise to massive shifts in the stuff that happens on top of them that's the one of the deep thesis or at least one of the TP theses that are driving this story so if you come back up well what is the insurgency in some sense the insurgency is people who have figured out how to use this new medium to accomplish their ends that's just the equivalent of you know the vietcong figuring out how to engage in guerrilla warfare in the jungles of Vietnam to actually fight to a standstill the world war ii era ish american army and that's that kind of idea so it's an insurgency playing this new battlefield honed to the new characteristics of this new environment playing it's people who are designed to fight the old war so it's fait accompli that eventually this sides going to lose and as we're watching it happened we can see the breaks occur and see as the sand keeps getting swept out from underneath the wall how does the wall crumble that makes sense yeah so then you move to the next stage the next front this is the front where much more of the energy is actually taking place from my perspective that has to do with something between the deep state and again the insurgency there's different language that used to describe it over over time but here when I when I talk about the insurgency I want to be clear that there's a broader sense of that so there's a concentrated sense the Trump administration but there's a broader sense which includes other kinds of things like in 2019 I called out the IDW and Qi on our part of that phenomenon you know the the Donald on reddit is a part of the insurgency and while is named after Donald Trump it isn't causally linked but he doesn't control it it doesn't control him it's just happening and I would say it has more influence and impact and is more fully of the essence of the insurgency than the administration itself is for example so the conflict between the deep state in the insurgency is of the same sort except in this case the deep state is deeper it has a lot more going on a lot more capacity a lot more degrees of freedom with which to operate and when it might even say in many senses the mainstream media that's happening appear is an aspect ever deeply connected they're not one-to-one but they're deeply connected to each other so here we're talking about a whole broad category of institutions and bureaucracies that have the characteristic of lifers you know people who work there for 40 years and so they tend to know each other and when you add to the the fact that they tend to know each other because they've just been living and working the same kind of place for a long time and had a certain affiliation with the institutional structure they're attached to say for example more than a broader context you add to that the notion that they actually have over the past 70 or 80 years begin to develop personal relationships they marry each other or they mirror each other siblings and so there's a meshing as that happens among the context of this this cluster of things I'm talking about a place like Harvard and the relationship between say Harvard and the State Department there's a lot of cross-fertilization people moving back and forth and there's even situations where a person happens to be the head of some particular division of Harvard might be married so there's a head of a certain division at State Department this is perfectly normal or they just travel in similar circles and have lots of bonds it's a and it's a consequence this thing the deep state which has a relationship with institutions bureaucracies people who have long term relationships with that and binding has a consistency to it and it acts in the world as an agent there was kind of agenda clip and I proposed less obviously that the deep stayed in the insurgence you're also in conflict that was another major proposition and I would say that we've seen that and we've seen in the in the contact of the Mueller investigation in the penumbra around it it's gonna be another term that describes the Russia gate problem with the terms of disused I don't know but I'm semantically assuming the word gate will be attached to it in Russia at the beginning I believe that the FBI putting together some notion of what was it called an insurance policy like this is just a peek into it's obviously mecca nations of the sort that will always be happening it's inevitable people are doing things they will do things within the scope of their agency but we've been watching that play out over a couple of years and if you have a sense of the way that these kinds of things tend to play out historically from my perspective has kind of been on script thank you you see the kind of thing happened that you saw with Russia games and you see with the music poor emerge and what you haven't normally scene is the recipient of that treatment continued to kind of just Bob above the surface when there's clearly something about Trump himself as an individual that has very you know he makes Slick Willy look like velcro there's a lack of friction in him which is notable but also I point out the concept that the insurgency because its operating in the context of this decentralized medium in a full a very flat graph has what's called an udder loop that's very rapid and that means is this is a concept from military theory or strategy observe orient decide act and then obvious when you act you do something in in the world and then you observe again to see what happened and the proposition is is that broadly speaking the more bandwidth your utter loop has which is say the more information that say you can push through the other loop faster both combined the more a strategic and capacity you have so more or less I knew the loop with higher bandwidth what I'll completely loop with a lower bandwidth in the proposition is that the insurgency is tapped into something a network decentralized collective intelligence that is running a much much faster luta loop than the deep state the deep state is i think of them just like very simply the deep state is running 50s nineteen all the blue Churchill both well we're gonna go to the blue church next and the right now I'm just partitioning them as part of a story of these things going to deeper deeper levels so yes but right now we're on the deep today so we might think of the deep state is running 1950s era server farms like you've ever seen with this look like just big rooms full of ENIAC machines with tape drives and there's big rooms and lots of them do them for a long time and they're controlling all kinds of like big lumbering robots and the dinosaur metaphor is quite appropriate and then the insurgency is connected to a bunch of fortunately own kids on cell phones on fortunate that quite literally and now we have the metal metaphor it's smaller and has less focused capacity to deliver significant directed energy but it's stir and is extremely responsive so as the deep state sort of winds up and fires off its its agenda so for example the concept of fake news if you wind back the clock actually emerged from the deep state before it was co-opted by the insurgency it's a very specific moment we saw it come out through sort of the ordinary channels and then what happened was that the the insurgency co-op's it and converts it and begins mutating and so wrapped with it they could just sort of see the deep state so do i back and it seals wondering what the hell happened and the conflict has been locked since then and of course in the meantime over the past several years the deef states been mutating has been involved in those strategies that don't work or being dropped is trying to find new ones and different groups are coming in to try to form something happening on this side but it's all still more or less running the basic code of the deep state we should just say running the blue church alright so we'll get there and then on the insurgency and of course has also been evolving in mutating and gathering and so the IDW emerges and q and on emerge and from my perspective as examples of something happening more in alignment with the essence or more in line with the grassroots characteristic of the generator function that's coming up that's the Trump insurgency from my perspective is a phenomenon kind of like a cork floating on a wave and the wave came and it's been radial to right or actually a surfer riding in a way that's even better metaphor they've been able to figure out how to ride that wave and surf it and show up his head in directionality an agency on their own but it's the wave that matters in some sense we can kind of skip the globalism pieces to happen that fast I mean I remember way back in the day when things like the trans-pacific partnership had a characteristic of really seriously scary how the hell are we gonna stop this fight this kind of a thing and they just woke up one day and was completely gone and of course we've seen the a lot of the machinery of globalism has just been but I think nafta's gotten is just amazing the rapidity with which that's been evaporated and I think that's largely because it never really established a strong position in tozzoli so the globalism was fundamentally still a American to a lesser extent EU functioning so as the forces of decentralization have been happening at this level this doesn't have a whole lot of its own coherency in so I continue to believe that that will continue to evolve and of course that's an area that has anyone who understands the history and political theory is reasonably concerned because any shift from a hegemony to a multipolar structure generally goes badly doesn't always but generally goes badly but doesn't mean that multipolar structures aren't themselves able to achieve stability over periods of time but what it does mean is that the shift is tricky so to the degree to which we are watching something where the notion of an American hegemony which was in some sense showing up as globalism the neoliberal globalist insist is breaking down and there's a move towards multipolar nationalism or something else by the way and I don't think that's stable we're in a moment of significant potential risk in small movements if anybody decides they want to reach for the brass ring then it creates a cascade of conflict so then we have the last front which is the culture front the culture of war and here I talked about the blue church in its specificity and my proposition is the blue church is deeper than these other ones so it's it's closer to the center of what's happening and on the other side now I've talked about the red religion which is deeper than the insurgency it's closer to the essence of what's happening and both of these are happening at the level of culture so here we have to actually think about how culture manifests itself up into causation but maybe we'll get there in a second so just for clarity we're talking about the blue church what I'm talking about or what I proposed that means is a certain way that culture is able to be and do in a context so the blue church is a given very specific instantiation of this kind of thing in the essay I wrote about the blue church in particular I called out for example the Victorian consensus the Victorian synthesis as something of the same kind some kind of organism a cultural organism if you'd like and that over the period between World War one through the end of World War two that collapsed and a new one formed and there's a whole bunch of things that go inside that box but broadly speaking you have things like how media technologies enable groups large groups of people to be able to make sense together make choices to get there an act effectively together right so basically forming a noodle loop as a group and the blue church was that sort of thing and its characteristic had to do with this sense of broadcast a sense of whether you're talking about in school there's a student so there's a teacher and there's a bunch of students so asymmetry and passivity one you know directionality so agency lives in the center in the broadcaster and reception lives in the in the receiver and there's a lot more receivers that there are broadcasters you see that basic topology show up over and over and over again over the period of the second half of the 20th century and the blue church is in some sense built around that or uses that it's a primary components mean it's like the skeleton the muscles of the blue church are that and we've talked about the who like who are who are characteristic representatives of blue church or are become Archbishop's in the church and again somebody like Harvard an entity like Harvard would be an example the State Department would be an example particularly like Kennedy's State Department would be an example you can see like how much those things connect a sense of meritocratic verticality NASA is an example of a blue church organization meritocratic verticality and then GE like Six Sigma highly efficient effective bureaucratic actuation down and that's that kind of a structure GE be a classic example so notice that a lot of these examples are 1970s right the blue church was at its highest and is most clear pristine in the late seventies and has been in the process of decline since then decline both because these kinds of systems have a built in like a rust or atherosclerosis they become burdensome in enough himself and become less efficient just on their own they're also subject to various forms of corruption the longer they're around and in this case the underlying basis the the source of a lot of the structure of the blue church a broadcast media has shifted and so the blue church is suffering for three distinct maladies simultaneously and it's shifted to this new place right so we have something where we have an old mature strong well-functioning I'm not well functioning but long functioning structure the blue church which actuates for example through the deep state through the mainstream media that is in the state of decline and then we have this new emergent thing the red religion which is in the state of Ascension trying to figure out how to do stuff and I think the developmental metaphor of a biological organism is quite good if you take a look at the age you might say that the blue church is saying in their mid 80s and they've been smoking and drinking a bit much so it's not a healthy eighties and then the red religion is maybe 14 so that's kind of that's a good sense of the shape of it maybe nothing's maybe they're in there even their late 60s but it's not a healthy sixties there's something about that and so so what is the red religion the red religion is first of all red and I need to kind of dial in on why it's red and what that means for long-term evolution so before we get there and just talk about religion versus church and then we'll talk about blue versus red the church leanness of the blue church was most of what i was talking about its form the way it shows up the balloonist the content is as far as they can tell a little bit of just an accident that over the period of the 20th century when Beaulieu which in the u.s. kind of represents the political left and read the political right ran into each other and conflicted blue one the culture war so by the mid eighties blue had won and it was in the process of them propagating itself out into the social field so most of the engines of the blue church are running blue code we're loving running blue content they tell do the stores they have values it's actually more to the point and while there was in the 50s for example a red church that was running red that's more that's gone and so so now I switch quickly to the mission of a red religion religion then come back to redness so the idea of religion is this idea that there is less formal structure it's like the Protestants versus the Catholics it's a much more of a peer-to-peer Bottoms Up grassroots spontaneous formation building up something that maybe looks like structure but is actually made of of sand that can fade right back and go back out into the into the dust and this of course is the natural way that organization will happen in something like the Internet and something like a asynchronous symmetric decentralized and by the way digital communications medium and so you see the mean wars our great example I mean wars in the blue church look like Madison Avenue and they look like a small number of potentially quite talented individuals trying to figure out what will sell and maybe using focus groups to home their message and then firing it out with a lot of intensity through all channels whereas what the meme Wars look like so the red religion is self-organizing self-assembling essentially everybody is participating and they kind of bubble up and certain one certain means that kind of vaguely go the right direction get picked up mutated replicated disseminated picked up a new peanut replicated and submitted and what works is sort of naturally grasped and felt and evolved in real-time and by the way in the process of evolving in real-time Orient's the tension in the organism towards those streams that evolve those that one so a good example would be the NPC meme maybe from a good NPC name is fantastic I mean think about it if you watch it and you can we can we we live in a digital world you can literally just zoom back the clock and see it emerge right there was a tweet from a gamer using the NPC metaphor don't be an NPC which to gamers mean something very obvious and simple and don't be something that is driven by non-agency that it has by the way sort of characteristic stupidity and simplicity to it they're just run scripts but the because a lot of people in the read religion were the way of gamers I think it landed and then it got picked up and hit it's stung there was something about it that generated an effect so it was both on this side and the red side it was felt as yep that makes sense that that lands I get it I kind of croc the essence of it and then oh these guys don't like it very much a press press the attack and so it was a spontaneous formation and then it spread huge amount of energy was pointed to figuring out how to modify it and and and move it into deeper and deeper levels of effectiveness and by the way effectiveness in the sense of like being cool figuring out how to be the one who innovates the thing that everybody else picks up oftentimes by the way anonymously so it's not being cool and becoming in a centralized point but I don't know being cool like just ended in the moment and then also what is up taken what sticks and does it and of course as we watch it over a period of very briefly like two weeks it dominated dominated the entirety of the social media environment to the point that centralized structures like Twitter had to modify their basic rule structure and roll out entirely new approaches to try to combat that thing and of course this is a classic example of trying to squat you know a hundred million flies now whack-a-mole whack-a-mole well like a fly because there's hundreds of and they're stinging and okay you just wiped out the entirety of the npc mean who cares by the time Twitter had moved to swipe it the red religion already moved on to something else and and the damage was done because now you remember Junius oranges point way back in the day when wiki leaks came out the bureaucracies are already dead because to the degree to which they are subject to negative risk from leaks they basically have two choices well three they can either just take it on the chin and then ultimately lose because they're subject to negative risk they can endeavor to constrain leaks which means significally increasing the internal policing or they can radically reduce the amount of communication they engage in and in any one of those three cases they're shrinking their sphere of operations dramatically same basic idea here right the idea is that the loop of the insurgency is moving so rapidly that when something like Twitter moves it's actually hurting itself more than it's hurting the insurgency and basically the insurgency is using its capacities to cause the blue church to punch yourself in the face over and over again question that comes up like the insurgency in the red religion are they synonymous and also and also because you you mentioned the IDW like would you identify that as part of the insurgency great yeah so if I think about it as like layer cake layers up the red religion is more basic than the insurgency the red religion is at the level of values and the level of strategy the insurgency is more at the level of purpose at the level of goals its endeavoring to do something you may even say the interest is level of aesthetic sensibility and so the insurgency is a manifestation of the red religion which is itself a manifestation of just religiousness which I was trying to describe and in that sense the IDW is also a manifestation of the same kind of thing which is to say it's showing up as a bottoms-up self-organizing structure that is powered by the wave by the energy of this new kind of medium with this new medium makes available and as such it is a natural ally so you could say that as part of the insurgency unconsciously but remember I've made a distinction between the Trump administration and this thing down here which is by definition decentralized all right so it's not a there's no point on which you could say that's in charge so to the degree to which the identity was doing this kind of thing functionally and effectively visiter the mass media then it is acting as part of the insurgency and it's an expression of religion and now here's where's get it gets interesting so this is actually a really nice point so remember I wanted to focus on the difference between the redness and the religionist piece so the redness is again kind of a historical artifact red was the loser of the last war so they weren't distracted by trying to run old machinery they didn't have any old machinery to run they were given the beautiful opportunity to have to learn new things and so the value structures the sensibility the even the dispositional types who were disempowered by the loss of the culture war of the 20th century found themselves in a evolutionary under evolutionary pressure and so they therefore more rapidly figured out how to begin playing the game in this new space they playing the religion game as opposed to the church game playing the network game as opposed to the broadcast game and I should mention by the way they also evolved mimetic defense mechanisms they the same tools that had been used in the cultural wars the 20th century calling someone a racist for example which still kind of decimates people who are from the 20th century has very little impact on people who are truly coming from the grass like 4chan doesn't care at all like it doesn't have any impact at all so that's true distinct things like one has to do with the semantic emotional language games that happen and the other one has to do with the OODA loop organizing collective intelligence piece and the redness of the red religion has to do with the artifact of a particular dispositional group kinds of people with backgrounds and values found themselves having to figure out how to new use new tools they figured out how to use those new tools and then began to have some success initially and by the way in gamergate as far as I can tell there are obviously than earlier examples that was the first time that I think we really saw the red religion had a certain self-consciousness or a win a win a fight it's probably better put and notice that they want to fight surprisingly so this makes the question of could it be a blue religion and of course does even need to be red or blue because many senses the notion of written blue is itself an artifact of kind of the landscape of the past century the last two centuries something like that means if you go back far enough that ideas that make a whole lot of sense maybe for 50,000 years but at some point it dissolves back into the the basics of humaneness so obviously there could be a blue religion it's sort of a question and then 2019 I pointed out the fact that perhaps with AOC we're beginning to see the emergence of that right so there's a blue content blue narrative blue story blue values showing up expressing themselves but now expressing them solving away which is very very I was a obviously different than the blue church and so AOC and Nancy's an insurgent in the Democratic and yeah in blue she's a blue insurgency and operating in the same sensibility as the red but because of the different valence of the typology of blue the dispositions the values the aesthetics and in the relationships in the position where the action happened actually happened to be it shows up differently and will continue to evolve different it's a different kind of organism in this environment so sort of the difference between I don't know a Jaguar and a crocodile both are predators both happen to live in the rainforest they're quite different cuz they have different origin stories and neither will do well in the desert and both are very effective in their particular sub niche of the broader ecosystem ok so then we can kind of move to the last piece when I wrote was writing those pieces I actually brought it for fronts and then line and then here's the deeper story so now we're kind of deeper story then of course the deeper story is all of the superstructure that we're talking about even culture with certainly media and bureaucratic institutions and globalism and particular political parties and particular political candidates are in many ways ephemera there are they're they're dust in the wind in the context of the bigger movements that are happening underneath and me and historically we've seen this happen many times I think a nice one happens to be the kind of 15th 16th century transition around the Gutenberg Bible if you want to just use media as one line right the shift of the the church in the classic sense to everything that followed after science capitalism the nation-state and the line that happened there you know all the hot stuff changed your feudalism shifted to a completely different political structure economic political structure your religion shifted from Catholic meaning truly universal to meaning one among many competing narratives and stories and structures and etc and even underlying human concepts of the nature of lived reality you know the Copernican revolution happened in that context the Darwinian revolution happened in that contact I suppose massive shifts are happening and we're in a circumstance that is at least as if not more significant in terms of the magnitude of the shift from this broadcast style to this decentralizing style media and therefore the culture that will emerge on top of it and therefore the institutional structures economics political structures that will emerge on top of that is going to undergo at least as much of a shift alright so looking at a massive change and the changes they were seeing up here are just kind of evidence of it yeah if you're pulling some sort of boat through the water and all you can see the boats invisible so all you can see is the waves we're seeing those are the waves and then even the bow waves and we're looking at okay here's the boat that's making them and so for example in this kind of context red and blue begin to become very problematic you start to see a lot more ability of smaller chunks and we're already seeing that like we're seeing for example the the balkanization of blue which is sort of naturally going to balkanize anyway but showing up as having lots and lots of little sub communities that are perhaps looking to find coherence in and of themselves and there's a really nice essay that was written culture war two dot oh I think so Peter Lindbergh where he just enumerated a list of like 13 or 15 of them and how they showed up and some scenes mimetic tribes a city called them yeah it's a very nice term which is hilarious of course because it begs the question of what does me anything mean to you and what mimetic tribe you're in will in some sense answer that question so we start getting some very interesting self referentiality of course that's where we are the you know the postmodern condition all the way down and in so my proposition and in fact my prediction is is that the story that we're watching is going to be a story that continues to see an increasing movement into balkanization and fractionating but fractionating at the level below culture freshening at the level of how we make sense of reality at all infractions the level of how we collaborate and come together as groups of people at all and by the way fractioning in these you know massive proliferation of agency many many many different ways to actually shift and change reality there will be mutating evolving at a accelerating pace because to the degree to which we have one shift the shift from broadcast to decentralize notice also the shift to decentralize carries with it is both a product of and an accelerant of technological innovation collective intelligence that has the capacity to change its own environment so this move is not just sort of a move from A to B it's a move from A to B miss where B is actually a dynamic process that is implicit ly accelerating and so it's moving was kind of like static to accelerating and it's a very different gig or to say velocity to accelerating feudalism to velocity to acceleration the things is actually group call acceleration ist's who I don't know very well but I measured just recapitulated certain things that they believe and so well I mean once you kind of settle there and say well where does that imply it implies a lot and okay we can kind of go for that if you'd like but that's the end of that story that situational assessment ends there and going back to sort of the blue church and there's a sort of sense in in the article it's breaking down increasingly quickly I mean the Covington story was a real was a real moment where I think a lot of people sort of looked at the media and thought wow it's the picture that's being painted by the media is so off and so clearly dysfunctional but you date it a little bit further back you dated to the Cavanaugh hearing I do yeah I my sense was that was kind of the the last ride of the blue church an effort to bring full churchly power to bear on a thing that is this topic and subject of churchly capacity Supreme Court justice I mean there's very few objects that are more centralized and more concrete you know we're talking about a if the metaphor is the blue church has the feeling of like a big heavyweight boxer who can punch hard this is somebody who's standing there with their chin punch and what happened they had to actually shift their agency into the blue insurgency so at that moment the blue church did the thing that happens all the time if you look at politically they brought in the mercenaries they brought in the the folks who are not part of their church see structure intrinsically as allies but if you watch what happening Cavanagh all hell broke loose at the church something was not in charge they did not control the narrative which is kind of their thing and and they lost but the losing wasn't what matter what mattered was they had to give power they had to actually give the game to a different kind of force begin to explain us what was the force um see that the hashtag resists hashtag me too which are much more of the blue insurgency John Robert stack has sped quite specifically from his point of view you have the insurgency and then you have hashtag resist right and these are two blue red and they're coming from the same source in energy and in my point of view happens to be that there's a lot of threads going on but I wouldn't disagree and so what ended up happening was they they move this from the declarant it's Thomas situation that dynamic to a dynamic that suddenly was happening in real-time in public on social media and was being not just fueled but then driven by the energy of the grassroots coming up just like me more fair that I described before the stories that were emerging were happening from the bottom up and they were being upregulated in a decentralized fashion and to some extent and somewhat clumsily and awkwardly the the people in the church you know Nancy Pelosi and mister lady from California so obsolete that I can't I don't even bother to store her name anymore she was recently in another mean where she told a bunch of kids Dianne Feinstein yeah Dianne Feinstein like very clumsily trying to imagine that they were steering this ship but obviously not at all they were on the other side of the waterfall riding the turbulence and it didn't take them where they wanted it to go do you have a sense that the the blue church broke decisively during Kavanagh and then covington for example was was the flailing around of a broken sense making system yes was to be sure i think the metaphor is over nietzsche actually had this really great quote where he talked about the idea that you know buddha died and they should have shadow for a hundred years something along those lines the the or the idea that i remember as a kid hearing this story that like a dinosaur would die but because its brain was so small and far away from the body that it wouldn't even know it was dead for like some meaningful amount of time something like that the blue church the back is broken it is no longer a vital living homeostatic organism but it still has a lot of energy right so it's flailing is a good term it's actuated in capacity it's ooodle ooodle and so it's going to increasingly actually a really good example here would be a drunken fighter yeah so at Cavan I reach that threshold point where it's actually a drunkard at a bar before where the reason keeps drinking where it's no longer actually in control of its actions it suddenly unconsciously reacting to the environment and it decides it's a really good idea to try to punch the bouncer and that's that's Cavanaugh and then and then it drinks some more it's now bleary-eyed and it's swinging wildly and as events are coming at it its responses are increasingly obviously what they are and a lot of the blue church's power lives in fantasy remember television has this characteristic of creating a fantastic Sensibility we project ourselves into a world that is not actually the world that we're in right for me to believe that I am watching what's happening in the video has a feeling of it being present but you reach for and you touch the screen you don't touch the face of the person that's not 3d in reality and of course even more characteristically I'm watching The Avengers which is really really not reality and yet particularly from contemporary humans weaned on that from childhood it maybe feels more real than the real reality I said the blue church a lot of it is based upon that ability to invoke an instinct and a habit of fantasy to tell a story to everybody orient their attention and choice-making based upon a really well told story and it's kind of you know the the the the king is obviously not clothed the story no longer has stickiness it's obviously a story there's two obviously a narrative this being created and forced down your throats through channels that are no longer even particularly effective at doing it and someone's silly and it's you know the best metaphor is actually that awesome show I believe it was Anderson Cooper but I'm not sure and hurricane where you have an image of him standing there like holding the microphone and the wind's blowing and he's like up to his chin in the water and then you realize that it's all a fake if the whole thing's a setup there's like two people walking by and rain boots the winds not even blowing very hard right you're like holy to set this is the news trying to show me an actual event in reality over here and they are boldface idli just creating a movie set okay great now I know where we stand what's reality really looked like kind of like that so that's the shift it's the consciousness of that being the case and the instincts that habit of okay every single time I encounter anything vaguely churchly I have to assume that it's an extremely deliberate intent to manipulate and probably coordinated in some fashion you can obviously come up here so Eric Weinstein called kayfabe yeah yeah although it's not clear to me that it's kayfabe in the sense then it's not quitting me the blue church knows they're faking they may have you know they've been drinking their own kool-aid they seem to believe a lot of their own stories which is weird because they're also clearly you know making things up so hard to say but somebody somewhere is playing kayfabe on that side of the story so then when you get to something like you and on all right so what happens with cue and on is that if you come at it with a perspective particularly come up with a blue church perspective it's either gonna look like so just to just to someone who maybe doesn't know what cue and on is can we just recap exactly what it is it's an alternative narrative about so it's kind of a either a conspiracy theory or an alternative narrative about what's going on that is being sort of generated by either someone or some group of people on the Internet yeah mr. Farrow circulation the way I would say it is there's a place on the internet called 4chan and it has a characteristic of being both ephemeral and anonymous meaning that posts are made text images and they are attached to have truly anonymous identity there's no particular way of finding out who it is and there's an ethos of having I'm not trying to tell people that you are somebody and it's on these boards that have a finite number of potential posts and and once the board is done the board is done and a whole new board has to be created so there's a ephemeral and anonymous character to this place what should you say it's really close to the essence of the kind of stuff that gives rise to this religion or this decentralized Network I'm talking about and October of 2018 I think you know 2017 supposed to show that and that board has all kinds of crazy on it all the time it's sort of known for just being crazy all the time but some post showed up that claimed to be having a particular inside knowledge about what was going on and in time frame by the way where what was going on was quite confusing to a lot of people and had a an aesthetic of asking questions provocative questions as opposed to giving answers and telling stories and medically remember this idea of the red religion identifies and up regulates things from the bottom up this kind of worked some attention was paid some people seem to think that was cool and it got disseminated and then some more post showed up now of course you can't ever prove that there's actually the same person or a group of people that's whole point synonymous but the same aesthetic was used and so some attention was paid to it and then it got bigger and bigger and then it got kind of big in that very small well in that subcommittee this small portion of the Internet and then there was some pair all kinds of craziness hard to happen and it began to percolate out more broad they started getting called cue anon is just a term that refers to the fact that 4chan the chants are anonymous and then a layer a penumbra start gathering around of interpreters and up regulators and people who are trying to make their own name on the basis of this meme and try to turn themselves into internet celebrities on the basis of something else Twitter followers YouTube channels been again to build around it and if you look at the center of it the thing that was going on in the chants there was in fact in the center of the stream of questions a narrative or set of Mario's answers to questions that were begin to form but notice the interesting invert instead of it being built around answers a narrative that was giving you the answer to the question this is what happened here it's actually built around questions that opened up and generated and arbitrarily large like a vast panoply of narratives that's a particularly for the first six to nine months it was hard to explain epistemologically unbound like what could be true wasn't even centered much less what was true right so the number of stories are being created was vast was a huge foam of narrative and since then over the past six months kind of like religions do is began to become more orthodox is more of a here's the story and has a counter near to feel to it so that's cueing up so the place that I think is most interesting is not it's mature and one might say sort of desiccated modern current form but rather what was going on in that first year or so the point where is exploding and if you look at that first year so it looks insane like almost schizophrenic Lee insane the number of things that were being proposed in the way they were being proposed and the rate at which change was happening was not the kind of thing that happens in meritocratic hierarchies and could never possibly have been handled by a single mind but it didn't flat part it actually held and gathered a meaningful amount of people who put their energy and time into it and while the signal-to-noise ratio is pretty low when the noise is high there was in fact also meaningful signal like real stuff was figured out and actually real predictions about future conditions that were more accurate than was coming from CNN we're also done not that hard and it's a little bar but any of it it actually happened now the proposition that I'm making which could be wrong but the thing that I found most interesting is that in something like you and on you're actually witnessing an even more fundamental version of the natural form of the collective intelligence that is down to this new media environment so if you look at the IDW the IDW is a little bit like what happens when the churchly structure becomes a little like takes it puts it lets his hair down you know chill out and be a little bit more flexible little more open-minded you come down where's Kunal's coming up and so if you look at both of them say okay what's the distance between them that distance that's the distance that needs to be covered before the religious function the new decentralized collective intelligence to close the gap all right when something like queuing on something that's that much flat spontaneous self-organizing capacity is able to generate a level of coherent thinking that Danny Debbie was produced well then we're on to kind of the other side of something and if if queuing on is the first manifestation of a new collective intelligence what do you think the next one might look like I should mention by the way I don't think it's the first Bitcoin for example is also a manifestation of the same basic driver but it's a notable and obviously very early so I'm what was the question what's next yes if it's an early collective intelligence what would what do you think the next one would look like and will it be even more virulent than queuing on as being it will by definition be more be able to queue it on if it is not more valence in queue knowledge not the next one now there's going to be an intermezzo with lots of experiments are going to be tried around the horizon if you look at the queuing on horizon there's lots of different ways of thinking about like do you think about it as a really powerful sigh out do you think of as a really powerful propaganda device do you think about as a really powerful way to gather a lot of people to do your bidding by manipulating them or do you think about it as a really interesting new way to do collective intelligence and since me there's lots of different versions of what might happen inside that space and I would actually be surprised if we haven't already if called the children of queuing on haven't already happened in the call to bad side covertly there's likely already been a number of different experiments trying to figure out how to extend whatever the hell happen there into some new kind of effective tool in the war on sense-making so the war on sense-making piece I'd be surprised we haven't seen something that has learned from Cuba on the sense-making side like how do we actually make sense together piece the most important part is going to be some level of epistemological maturity that's going to be the decisive factor and what I mean by that is being aware of how since making happens being conscious of how your own sense making has happened how you're showing up in terms of sense making and then being mindful and deliberate intentional about how one might go about collaborating in a decentralized bottoms up experimental fashion that has a good epistemology behind it I think that's the decisive factor so while there may be some it's quite funny actually if you used the blockchain as an example remember you had Bitcoin they had this kind of cascade of light coins alt coins there were more less Bitcoin jr. variations on the theme but they weren't that interesting if they had a theorem which was actually a very like a whole new kind of idea so there may be kind of alt coins in the queue and on space but the next thing the next real decisive innovation that space is going to be something of this sort something that has a self-awareness to epistemological capacity and is bringing that into its design and do you think that would emerge from the trans from the same place that came from that's a very good question it is not particularly likely but it is not impossible this is because the Chan's are a highly chaotic and very open environment an artifact capable of absorbing novelty at a relatively high rate the individuals who typically spend time the chance have a relatively immature epistemological found a and so as a consequence will not naturally be attracted in this direction but if it does gain traction it can grow because there has to be certain characteristics of the space where a collective intelligence could be created and that doesn't feel like Twitter it doesn't feel like Facebook it doesn't feel like that what are the minimum what what kind of space is required for that collective intelligence to evolve I mean the trans is a particularly is a particularly interesting right petri dish so you're provoking me indeed having a little bit of a dialogue around the nature of how the characteristics of a medium give rise to certain kinds of collective intelligence and a detailed level so for example you can compare the chance to tumblr and notice the distinctions and notice how identity forms in tumblr and notice how social currency shows up in tumblr and there is how dare deforms in a chance and how social currency flows in the chance they're different right their characteristics at a low level are different reddit different Facebook different and there's the difference between what happens when you have a like button and you don't have a like button even when you have a like button that has the ability do hearts and smiley faces and just a thumbs up for there's these minor differences actually make a difference in terms of how collective intelligence naturally forms in a space so the question you're asking is actually quite profound what might be a kind of space that is conducive to this form of collective intelligence and the first thing that comes to mind is it will almost certainly not be purely virtual because the kind of thing that we're looking for is not available intrinsically in the kind of ephemeral virtual weak links connection that can happen on the Internet in disembodied communication so plausibly at least we're looking at something which is a are LVR combo something where you actually have embodied relationship real-life virtual reality complex re it's a real live person personal reality combo that's able to have the bandwidth of interaction to explore a piston illogical novelty well and find ways to achieve collaboration achieve effective collective intelligence in a space of extremely high epistemological liminality then that can be extended through virtual means but it seems to me plausible but very unlikely the something that this can be formed in a highly virtual environment and certainly unlikely for to be formed first they might be copied once the basic notion perhaps has been generated you might see it copied to use software as a metaphor if you think of let's just make queuing on version 100 it's not that let's just normalize there if you look at say version 1.5 I can see something that's that would happen in the domain of the rationalist epistemology which would have game theory as a primary basis and therefore would be allegiance with the the blockchain community and that would be able to achieve a very high level of collective intelligence through virtual channels you might even consider that it would be a perfectly viable version to and it would have a mature epistemology that would be able to be reasonably functional in the new place so wouldn't have a evolving or novel epistemology that would have a mature one that would be effective in the context of decentralized collective intelligence a little bit like sesame credit if you know what I'm talking about that the Chinese social currency structure topologically these two things would be roughly identical and so what you would end up seeing is a potentially very rapid proliferation of a new form of collective intelligence the combined a bit quite quite intelligent and effective but it would it has a finite lifespan it would actually achieve a closure and collapse event and probably a relatively rapid time like maybe even new years almost certainly decades and I said by the way I feel exactly the same thing about what's happening in China so I think China is going in that direction and you should expect to see a significant increase in collective intelligence followed by a collapse difficult to recover from collapse movement and so to the degree to which you see something like that emerge in the coffee analytic tradition the blockchain crypto space decentralized but trying to figure how to make sense from that direction you would see something of that scheme so it would have an s-curve the ester would have significant you'll be a hell of a lot better than the blue Church so it would win a lot of ground but it would have a natural end and collapse in its lifecycle for reasons that I can explain if you'd like to that's sort of the first sense you mentioned in passing the other day that even in Hollywood there's a scent I mean there's a look there's a sense that a lot of us have that we're kind of running out of either novelty or running out of like all the possibilities are being played out in almost every single medium simultaneously is that true I mean it just seems like watching Hollywood films now that they're increasingly derivative that just seems to be we're going in increasingly smaller circles it's cooking it's very simple when you have a system that is designed fundamentally to maneuver people around by manipulating them at a level of their incentive structures particular there's no chemical incentive structures then what ends up happening is you have you get more and more competition for for controlling you buy your dopamine and serotonin response curves it gets pretty narrow and it has a half-life to it and so I have to give you more I have to give you more it has to become more pure and more intense and just run that across every dimension so it's that curve which by the way is the same more or less the same curves just describing but a different domain they were witnessing in these frameworks so Hollywood you know every movie has to be more visceral more melodramatic and more intense in both of those dimensions you know we can't just have conflict on earth we have to accomplished in space because if comfort especially if comforts in space of time we have to act the entire universe has to be up for grabs and asked me up for grabs in the loudest possible way imaginable over as many hours as I can pin your ass to the seat so that the effect that you used to get by watching a guy on a table going like this Lance it's just that it's the cocaine effect or that's what I used to call it and is that the same thing with social media yes it's the same fundamental dynamic and remember it's a fundament that's happening two dimensionally meaning it's happening in a sense of my ongoing addiction to Facebook and it's happening in snapchats desire to move me from Facebook to snapchat so it's a co-evolutionary competitive dynamic to yank me around by my limbic system and where does that go that ends up playing itself out oh yes absolutely it's terminal it's not that big t terminal meaning that it leads civilization to some sort of hard collapse and reboot just take a drug addict just use that as the metaphor you hit rock bottom you either die or you have a moment of clarity and you know start moving in the direction that's that's what goes in our case as with a drug-addict it's quite challenging because the tools that we use just make sense of what's happening are the tools that are in fact addicting us so figuring out what's going on is particularly challenging when the things you use to figure out what's going on are the things that's going on and so this is why reboots liminality unplugged is kind of the first step and I mean unplug not just from like Facebook I mean unplug from thinking in the way that you currently think at all like reboot the whole thing all the way down to just kind of sitting around staring blankly and then very slowly it's fun of the software metaphor it's perfect you've ever had your computer system really seriously jacked by hackers you have to put things back very carefully creakle if you actually have to put it back right we can't just burn to the ground to get a whole new system because it's not quite clear whether you have malware in a particular sub component so you just have to be very careful just takes things step back buy back now we actually have a really nice opportunity so we have a necessity to go through this reboot process because they all aforementioned hacking of our limbic systems and the co-evolutionary game theoretic dynamic that means that the hacking is not going to stop on its own either the pusher addict is a dynamic that doesn't have its own like the pushers never going to be in position as soon as they give up is another pressure and so that's that's got its own logic to it so we've got that we have an assessment and this is we have to get off that train but then we have an opportunity which is because the whole  world is shifting from one fundamental way of going about doing collective intelligence to another it turns out the entire structure that has been hacked is obsolete anyhow so we can move to the new one and the new one is what the very least is different so a lot of the old hacks aren't going to work and this dudes in this new domain so if you actually allow yourself to really free your mind and settle into a very what I call the bottom of the you which for example Buddhist meditation gets you into that level of just emptiness and then from that place begin to recreate some new way of making sense in yourself and then making sense together with other people you have the advantage that you are also almost completely immune to most of the techniques that come from this previous location it has a sort of a downside which you can't watch TV anymore but I guess that's where it is but there's no point in watching it anyway if it's all getting played out and in ever decreasing loops yeah it's true I mean it's sad it's kind of like to find out what happened to Captain America but it is what it is cool Jordan thank you yeah [Music] you [Music]
