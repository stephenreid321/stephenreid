so the question is this why is it now that there's a vastly more popular sense of the end of times the embezzling more popular sense of bad things are happening in a big way imminent doom right and the short answer is is because the the envelope in which we've been held the I will call it the civilization structure the the institutions that we've been in they are affect actually die yes right so there is there is a moment that this phrase of like allowed the dead word to be heard I'm glad you're saying this because I heard an interview with you and it sounded like you're agreeing with the interviewers proposition that climate change was the thing or something that like we have it was he was talking about why Game of Thrones is so popular and it's such a great sort of allegory for what's going on right and you've got the white walls and she was talking about climate change being allegory for the White Walkers and this incoming thing and I was thinking well yeah there is that but the major thing is the truth is that the system that those aspects of the system are dying right the old media is dying the old politics is dying those things are the things that are dying yeah yeah sure in the archetype to the archetype of the White Walkers is not climate change they're kind of the white walkers is when civilization Falls things get uncomfortable that's not a good thing we don't like it when that happens those things are collapsing there is a  great doom right right so you know if you're as an individual human as you grow up right there were it's time to leave behind childish things well from the point of view of the childish things what that means is it's time to die mmm from the point of view of the South that is continue to go on is the time to grow up all right that's just always happened that's just what it means for change to occur some things literally just die they go away forever in Tunis Hill well in this case what's happening right now is that gigantic chunks of what we have thought it was kind of being the world we've had this weird model that the notion that when you're six you go to kindergarten then you kind of toil through primary school and then you go to high school and you go to college and they get a job is the world all right and it's not and that's going away all right so what's happening is that people are perceiving because it's becoming increasingly obvious that all of these artifacts of the way that we've gone about doing civilization in all the different ways like pick your poison is really matter because they're all kind of tied together are breaking down and failing in a way that is no longer easy to pretend isn't happening and so as a consequence this triggers a deep visceral sense and that's a good thing right because that deep visceral sense is the return to the unlimited the return to the mystery the return to the the state which by the way in folks is conversation human beings have encountered this problem before we've been in living in the valley yeah we've had a situation where the the drought has come and we need to leave well how we deal with that is first and foremost we drop the parts of us that wants to stay where we are we allow the sadness of change to occur and we process that we feel something bad has occurred danger is just emerged for sure like leaving the the old fertile valley and migrating across the desert is fraught with danger and some of us may not make it but at the same time it activates in us as well the call to consciousness the call to gather together the call to begin to actually become thinking in a group and then into an adventure find your heroes find your courage find your your role by who you are in this place and get deeply good at it find out how to build real relationships with the people around you have trust and have the power and binding you get across that desert no matter what happens and then go and on this case did this had is paradise or at least something really awesome like it may not expect that will in fact be a terminus and then end I think it'll be more in the direction if we get to go to Mars but it's a God level it's another it's a whole other level that's right that's right - a whole load of the that we were just dealing with before because we thought that's just what the world was yeah and it won't be there anymore that means liquid saying earlier about each sort of level generation less miserable crap to deal with you have this huge space in which you can be mighty yeah yeah it's um what is the metaphor for that what we haven't we have a metaphor in biology it is the transition from caterpillar to butterfly is the metamorphosis yeah which is the classic one I was obsessed with that as a child it's perfect it's perfect that's it that's what's happening it's just butterfly season in what I've seen of your stuff you seem to lean more towards a idea that we are doomed you mentioned the setting you tell that story because that was quite funny but you meant oh I don't know this folks who are who are experts in risk they've been monitoring all the different forms of risk and they were these would be world experts in say nuclear proliferation the risk of nuclear war or nuclear bombs going off and then experts in like disease global disease particularly people deliberately designing germ warfare and get it getting out and then two or three more massive errors and and each one of these individuals came up and they were all and they're each speaking in each one the theme was more or less the same was or the the the approaches that we currently take the institutions that we have to police these kinds of risks are barely holding on by their fingernails right now and the problem is continuing to get worse which is it's kind of like the exact inverse of the advantages of decentralization so we could talk about like the democratization of media in a very positive sense and of course I guess if you're currently in charge of mass media it's negative but for everybody else is mostly positive and we can even talk about like the democratization of genetic engineering in a positive sense there's really powerful stuff that comes out of it but also there's a negative sense which is that the things that used to be very rare and used to be easy to control because they were so rare as they become widely available and still powerful you know it's it's the kind of thing where until and unless we invent some new way of dealing with that if we're still trying to manage it with the old techniques they are very very dangerous and when I guess for me that the real the key inside is just is just this up until I think I may we've talked about this before but up until about 1947 human beings really couldn't it up and disease could come and kill us or you know family and can wipe us out but even if we ward like crazy that World War 2 style war just a tiniest blip in our population even the Bronze Age collapse which took out like seven major civilizations still effectively non no effect at all and the human but around 1948 when the u.s. and the Soviets both had H bombs we started moving into the zone where we actually could it up for everybody like we could kill everybody and that's just a new state and of course in 1948 that consciousness was a big deal like oh wow this is this is a big deal we need to be very careful about it and over the next 50 or so years we got kind of okay at not getting everybody killed me remember there's some dodgy moments there in the Middle where it seems like it might not work out but the problem was actually relatively small like we literally all we had to do was prevent in this case five or six people around the world who were pretty well known like the leaders of Nations and pretty well monitored from pushing the button simultaneously like even if just one of us push the button and we could probably still make it so we didn't think that's the problem but as technology has gotten more powerful and more decentralized things like cyber warfare is a simple example 15 years ago cyber warfare didn't matter that much who cares if a hacker shuts down the computing grid in a major city but as things like our electric systems and our water systems and maybe even our automotive transportation systems are all on a computer grid one hacker one unhappy hacker in one location could shut down an entire city and that could generate actual chaos like the cities are large and the ability to rebuilt it might being very hard and that's to say nothing of something like say CRISPR where that same group of kids maybe 20 well-resourced PhDs could build a super gene virus that could wipe out a billion people and that's unprecedented right and so what's happening is is that the magnitude of the risk is now existential we can now kill everybody and the kinds of things that are in that magnitude are proliferating and the difficulty getting access to it is going down so that Ark is a very bad arc like that that that story ends badly in every in every in every every way you tell it it ends badly which is not by the way that say that's tight it told many times as well that's true is the thing yeah we have we have heard it's kind of this story we heard the most through like the sixties through to semi recently right was this the consciousness of tapping into that deep the deepest of mythos of wait a min we have as humans as a species we have witnessed moments that at least to our local try we're apocalyptic we've had situations where we all starve to death we've all had a flood where something really seriously back something so bad happened that we still know about it 2,000 5,000 years later so we have that and so nuclear war raised that energy and so the positive side of the story is we have that in us we have in us the notion that that's the thing that happens and we also have the notion of what the right answer is we know how to respond to it at least mythopoetic Lee and I guess sort of your side of this story which I bother would completely agree with and believe in him that's all I care about is focusing on going there is that there's a mirror image yeah that these same powers can be used for good yes the difference I think right now is that up until recently they could be used for good now they must be used for good yes which is which is I mean kind of an imperative for us to transcend to the level we need to get to to become the species that we could be you need those kind of stakes mm-hmm I like that in our direction yeah yeah and in the old balance no light without shadow etc and no hero without the balanced villain you need that motivation to be greater and to go further and to be a better version of yourself and you know a better version of all of us together because as you've talked about it takes all of us working way harder and making all of us way better together to be able to combat those things nice I like that so if you can imagine like taking these these forces these these places that we could go these poles of Heaven and Hell right these intense moment modes and then try to turn them into a tool as you say that because motivation that the the prospect that this hell is the thing that lies in our future unless and this prospect of this thing human is a thing that lives in our future if and if you can find a way to build in yourself the capacity to relate to it in that fashion meaning allow the notion of the prospect of Hell unless to be a motivator not a demotivator which is what I do have been do for a long time mm-hmm it kind of and it seems silly not to right yeah the the opposite leads to what is it lead to misery and tragedy and sorrowing and cancer and death the opposite is a joyful existence in which look around you look at this is glorious  that we exist in that couldn't have even been dreamed of by people a few generations previous yeah it's astounding isn't it like the the amount of beauty and joy that we can witness yeah just now much less that we could witness is in fact actually this town it is the kind of thing that is only written about in like poetry and mythology and it's actually a present it's real yeah this is a day-to-day light time and what I find particularly encouraging is that someone starting from this position like I have a five year old kid I have a five year old boy called Hercules who plays roblox and minecraft and like and Lego he plays Lego in the real world he plays roblox and minecraft inside a computer he has no limit to his imagination for creation he sees no end point of where he can't sort of like create what's in his head and turn that into a thing he lives in this lake glorious paradise that his ancestors had sort of sweated and died same as it gets to the point of and like the idea that that would all sort of collapse just at that point of triumph kind of seems silly like he and all of his little brothers and sisters and your kids who you were telling me a story about them all working together on this minecraft project like some incredible hive mind yeah that's what will get us through these things so this reminds me of the the thing you're mentioning the outside which was really interesting to me I'd never heard it before I think it's amazing is the you said wholesomeness is the new Punk yeah and I love that so I think this is the right bridge because that's the energy that you're talking about I've been thinking a lot and talking a lot for a long time about these cultural sort of shifts we swing on a pendulum every 7 years between punk nihilism and psychedelic sort of hippy optimism and then there haven't seen a grander scale the last time that swung was or at the end of 2012 was the end of the last peak thing and people were talking about hey it's staged alien invasions at the 2012 Olympics and things of that nature and then it all got then everyone sort of descended into complaining about you know invasions of foreigners and things of that nature we're going back into a psychedelic territory the difference is in this time is we've been through many many sort of generations of rebellion against the old order as it reminds me of a spitting image sketch about Madonna sort of how much more naked could she get and then she pulls off all this skin but it's like we've been through every kind of rebellion the most rebellious thing you can do right now is take personal responsibility commit to a person raise a family with that person invest yourself fully in them being the best they can possibly be like wholesomeness is the most countercultural rebellious thing you could do right now like wholesome earnest therefore wisdom ooh punk rock and what's dope about that is that fixes loads of problems if like on a mass sort of scale everyone's good going okay called the cool things to do right now is to take personal responsibility and invest the time and energy in making myself the best version of myself I can possibly be if people are doing that on mass you don't even know what what the effects of that could be it's because it hasn't happened before and because the Internet is here you have this on a mass scale you have cultural icons like Ethan in healer at age three about to have a child and be the first sort of YouTube wholesome family this is like this is bigger than Mister Rogers this is way bigger than most artists this is you're seeing this from this from the ground you see because these are two kind of like Mimi edged lords kind of coming out of the counterculture like growing up and so we're in a place where the the like the the tyrannical the rebellion against the tyrannical king the tyrannical king is quite obviously not in charge in a deep way right there's a was a phrase like Buddha died and it took a thousand years before his shadow was still being shown like yeah sure I get it we can we can still sort of identify a simulacrum of a tyrannical King and to be sure there are sort of like powerful bad guys out there with with power but the reality of the capacity of the people to just choose to enter into a new way of being is well it's there it is simply there and the other thing that I was thinking about is this concept of wholesomeness is so it's so powerful because there's when two different ways you can go about making a good choice like doing the right thing one way is you can do the right thing because you've been told it's the right thing to do mm-hmm that's hard it sucks it's fragile you're almost like struggling against it you know it's like you eat your broccoli and what's gonna end up happening is eventually you're gonna grow up and you're not gonna eat your broth because the authority figure is not there tell you which attendee the  opposite as much as you can right now if you actually folsom you're eating your Brocket because it's the right thing to do and it's easy it's just a natural thing and so this builds up from the bottom it's basically just building it on a solid foundation and you build it on the base and so okay I'm gonna take responsibility and then I'm gonna enter into a relationship with another human being where I'm gonna take responsibility for the relationship and and with human being who's taking responsibility for Mike is herself and then we're gonna have a child together responsibly and we're gonna take responsibility for that child and we're gonna start stepping out and taking more responsibility for the place where we live and where the child's my perhaps going schooler is right humanity and and not and not with a sense of like powerlessness and therefore the sense of either like that lashing out edge of I'm powerless and the only way I can express my anger at powerlessness is do that shot but with the sense of okay how do we do how do we do this and how do we find other people with whom we collaborate and can coordinate because we can we can find them anywhere who are willing to enter into honest relationships with us to build these things okay everyone's on that same level everyone's parents divorced yeah nobody wants that life don't wants to die alone in an older person's home that's so you can see that everywhere now no one wants that that's the worst thing that could possibly happen to you what they what aside from nuclear annihilation is better than that it is actually I completely agree yeah vastly better that notion of being completely alienated from humaneness and dying in that context is abysmal we've now witnessed that we've seen that experiment that happened and I think you're right I think there's a deep visceral sense I mean honestly I feel how did I say this right I feel a sense of like how can we actually help the baby boomers get across that threshold like how do we know they've got to be absolutely terrified by the recognition that the world that that they live in that they've helped build largely helped build is not one that they want to be actually truly old and die in and yet you know it's not yet available we don't yet have the things in place to allow them to have a family and a community that is rich and can meet human beings even as they move into elder hood and then death but that is clearly the thing that needs to happen and I think we could all perceive that all the way down to our you know in the depths of our bones yeah yeah it's pretty duck the the sort of the baby boomer thing of oh they run around and like had all the drugs and had all the sex and then we're like right no more of that for anyone else and now we're gonna take over every industry possible and we're actually not gonna give up any of our jobs ever and we're gonna stay here and we're gonna live till we're like 100 others that the ending isn't so nice for them actually it's like a Scarface thing yeah people always forget the ending of Scarface we're like you know his sisters like he gets she gets killed and it's his fault and he dies and stuff people just think about let the fun bit of Scarface that's right yeah the ending of Scarface is not a good idea it's a moral lesson and the ending of the boom is the potential ending of the boom as is this is the saddest is the sadder standing there is it's so interesting because it is actually just down to a choice yes like as individuals and as a group they still have the capacity to change the story so that's the superpower is when you decide because yeah you did the optimism thing although the wholesomeness thing it's just a decision and you decide it every day and you acts on it every day every day you go out and interact with the world you could glare at someone you could smile at them just the little small tiny things like that are the things that then ripple out and maneuver and you have to be mindful all times because is very easy to get the trucks and distracted from that path yeah and fall into a rage or something pointless or - to be brought down by a potential dark possibility or whatever it is it's it's a thing that requires much work and purpose but purpose brings power without purpose you're powerless something and then it's depressing you feel like but if you have purpose that's powerful thing and if you go out and enact that in the world and continue to do that then it grows it grows exponentially right and everyone around you is doing it as well there's a whole bunch of you doing it right howdy it's easier and easier and more and more powerful yeah it has the the characteristic that in the technology world they call a positive feedback loop or an exponential what's called a network effect and it happens in you first yeah you make if you have to just make one choice and then you can listen to the consequences of how that choice is better than the other choice and then as the basis of that okay I'll make some more in that vein to feel like that and go in that direction then you get more clarity on what that feels like to make those kinds of choices and you get more courage because if you have more hope that might actually lead to better and you start to see things working and the other that works maybe this will work and then that does work and then it becomes this this practical real-world thing kind of like I was saying earlier about the minecraft generation just knowing certain things work you know the the dank meme community knowing that Chaos magic works right knowing that so you know this stuff works you know if you put it into practice you will have good results you'll feel good ever and around you'll be good it's just and who would choose to be to live in horror when you could live in glory and wonder this is a choice we're all making together right now yeah hey gang and this is where before we forget this point because we realized this earlier and the be exciting and all these cultural things are very important you know what was his name Andrew Breitbart would say that politics is downstream from culture I would say that everything is downstream from culture absolutely chord strategy for lunch yeah yeah so therefore it's important and part of the whole story of this new golden dawn is the like the biggest thing in cinema is the Marvel Cinematic Universe and these gods reborn as archetypes rendered by a splendid technology in such a fashion that like we could never really like imagined where people would have that you know you would imagine a thing but this is key there you can like touch it and go in this it oh my god look at these amazing it's flying it's not like he's not lying on an ironing board with a green screen it's like he's  playing great and a Marvel have just bought back Fox and it was like Google getting the x-men back also means they're getting back the Fantastic Four and I was all excited because that means that that Kirby stuff that which is really really powerful Jack Kirby who was connected to the unconscious and the ether in a way that few humans ever happened certainly in our lifetimes but what did you point out what happens when the Fantastic Four comes back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe incredible writers is that with like the x-men that we've they have that whole story of what's called the punk rebellion the marginalized in the atomized and what that feels like and with the Fantastic Four it's a completely different feeling it's different era right it's that notion of hold from this oh it's incredible yeah it's so funny I remember that I for those people who grew up weaned on pop culture as we did I I certainly have had the continuous experience of disappointment in our storytellers failing to deliver on the promise and by the way the obligation of being the ones who actually create the deep mythos the drive and orient our lives yeah George Lucas sort of being quite notable and then I noticed that that the in the in the telling of the Fantastic Four stories that have shown up in Hollywood thus far I felt sad and more sad than I would have thought I should have felt like why do I feel sad about that this revealed it like I actually remember as a kid sitting down or laying down and reading those comics having a feeling of a connection to family having a feeling of connection to a sense of human wholesomeness to community that it's funny it feels more like mr. Rogers it hasn't really existed since like and I've almost missed that but I got it in power pack and read some of the older fantastic possible power papers about the children it was like and they're like they were the kids and they were their parents they loved their parents and they respected them when it was like it's very beautiful in that there were snacks and these evil lizard demons anyway they're the x-men thing kind of took over yeah and it was that punk rebellion nihilism against all these like little factions and everyone but we've done that that's the thing we've done that now we've gone through that to the it's very Adam we've kind of gone through every kind of a little tribal thing what do they call it in section yes that's kind of broken everything down to the thing where you go okay the smallest like minority is the individual okay we've done that bit that bit is done it's now zoom it's fantastic for time yeah and it's the family together go into Mars go names  space and defeating Galactus yeah it's amazing and it's it's interesting if you think about it that's why they got it wrong when they did the Fantastic Four in the past they were trying to do it in the vernacular of the x-men they couldn't commit to the bit no there was no context at the time it was the wrong time yeah well you just can't do Fantastic Four it's like they couldn't do Superman right Superman hasn't been done right for a long time that's right Superman is far too wholesome Superman is is a symbol of everything that humanity could be if we got it together yeah if we really got it together and really believed in each other and we really were the best version of ourselves you know and he was he got all that from his father his earth father Park Kent who was just the  just distillation of goodness and like you know the past however many years you couldn't tell that story cuz no one wanted to hear it it's like that was a joke yeah you know  yeah guy being nice we've done that we edge it ourselves and so we could edgy no more obviously I'm gonna put this I mean I haven't put a star on this just precisely because of probably poor calls and the wrong kind of energy but this in some sense is the Jordan Pederson story right he is he comes in and he shows up and he shows up as my man suppose a bit of a northern Canadian a little bit more austere version of a dad who wants you to be better off right but at the end of the day is but dad who wants to be better off yeah he's here to help you grow up and be a more fully meaningful human at a point when that had been completely for governor that was a thing that anyone was supposed to do it so evaporator point went days were like hanging out pretending to be six Damien at forties yeah yeah absolutely and kids who are in their sixties when they were 16 had no idea what it meant to actually interact with the man at all yeah never met one and so that's it's so funny to see how that archetype is returning and then BAM you got your you got your Fantastic Four so for those mavens who happen to potentially be in control of this particular piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe please find an artist who in their heart and in their soul deeply grasps the essence of that which is supposed to be expressed through this and allow this to be the vehicle that it needs to be yeah and then the world will be saved everything then then we can save mankind everything move on right you can get on with then we can get on with Mars that's awesome
