[Music] Jordan Peterson has become hugely successful what do you make of the phenomena why do you think he's become so successful now there is a drought of authenticity and courage and Peterson has found that hunger and he's tapped into it and I'm I admire his ability to detect it and to speak to it plainly in a way that it resonates with I did we were on a panel together in Vancouver and I watched his talk and he described his own surprise at how effective his message had been and he basically said that if he had outlined his message as the core of a business model that it would have looked laughable to him and that he was as shocked as anybody that people are resonating with it but when when you live in a world that is as full of crap as the world we live in where people are advertising bullshit to you from the moment you get up to the moment you go to sleep and then somebody finally tells you some truth that you need to hear it's a relief it's a relief just to know that there's some channel that isn't compromised by nonsense and he I don't think he's the only one speaking truthfully but I think he is speaking from the heart and people know it I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of communication with other human beings and this is all about the notion of admixture that one must have a mixture of of love I mean he uses the mythopoetic to make sense the order order and chaos the way or the Daoist way is the alchemical admixture of order and chaos and that's it like that's how you do it and so if you you biased towards orderliness you find yourself in a rigid non-adaptive non creative non exploratory framework which will die because the world changes if you bias towards chaos you you eat your young and evaporate which also theis for obvious reasons and the key is to actually enable these things to be in relationship with each other and vital healthy relationship with each other and I think that's in some sense the essence of what he's focusing on and instead of the core what he's acting about he's very easy to work with as his voice is an instrument because he speaks very deliberately and sonorous ly and rhythmically anyway he actually speaks in in a kind of form of rhythmic poetry sometimes he is actually rapid Peterson's words plus low Phi hip-hop equals jbp way at first it's like oh it's a novelty thing and then I kind of listen to him is like no it's not a novelty thing this is actually really good yeah that's been that's been the reaction all over I think that was Peterson's reaction he was instantly like thought this was gonna be silly and was amusing it was like oh this is actually awful and I were now essentially proving useful and that's generally interesting that you say as well that Peterson has a very musical or a very performative aspect to his speech because he talks about performing that performance or aligning yourself with the truth and if you're aligning yourself with the logos of the creative principle you would expect to be for that to have an effect on your actual performance but he feels like a very embodied speaker when he's onstage like he's fully inhabiting the stories that he's that he's telling and that that performative aspect of it is seems to me at least also related to what he's talking about the logo of something incarnated more in your life and incarnate and more in your in your being yes and watching him become that over the years because he was not always as as confident and able to just now you know you free stars right he's his whole career yes all careers really reminded me of it's very $0.50 for example got big off the back of drama there was created drama you know beefs with other rappers and being shot 13 times and all this stuff which draws people into the story but then he had this huge body of work and that kept people there Peterson did this Peterson had these public dramas and that brought people to him but then when they got to him they there was this huge body of work for them to get sort of lost and immersed in it Peterson has some kind of drama like every week at this point he's like the ultimate sort of contemporary battle rapper he's at war with all sorts of people at all times and it's brilliant very interesting and if you're inside you know if you're a rap fan or if you're what would you call if you're a intellectual dark whatever the hell it is fat it's like this guy's getting incredible beefs every week right and there's a new sort of supervillain to root against every week three guards to him or if you're on his site or not you know it's the whole thing's very entertaining but then he pulls you in and then there's all this meaning and this huge body of work [Music] but he's quite new on this light if you watch him like 15 years ago it was a bit awkward and sort of he was very charming and he knew what he was talking about but the absolute fucking beast that he has become as a performance creature who can now just rock up at an amphitheater and just like freestyle the new to our lecture off the top of his head and he's very into not repeating himself too much in his lake you go see a standard comedian you'll see pretty much the same set every week for like a year or something right he won't do that he's more like a very good DJ you know he has all these yes like a fistful of things that you know his works together and they're linked and he can take on these different journeys but depending on who's in the room and where he is he will create a new and transformative always experience where it where is his insight coming from and so we talking to you when you were describing hey you almost sound a little bit like Jordan pieces I mean in the sense of yeah I mean if I had to describe my worldview in a nutshell it would be sort of a Neoplatonic so there was a Neoplatonic stoic mystic Chryst agnostic so the idea of Neoplatonic I believe it I have always just sort of felt like there is a realm of ideal forms stoic do the suck it up fat kid and do the hard thing 100% Gnostic there is a certain ineffable experience of being and then the mystic Christic is some some reflection on the judeo-christian Western tradition but nothing to do with 2,000 years of bureaucratic administration and everything to do with what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos and Chronos the intersection of kind of sacred and profane time in human form so in that respect yeah I would track with with Peterson my sense is for me my you know gnosis or understanding has come from ex ptosis has come from peak experiences and my sense for him at least as he shares what he does of his life has come from catharsis has come from the suffering it's come from battling depressions come from staring the abyss the face versus the view from the summit and those are ideally come full circle and reinforce each other but if I had to sort of delineate maybe where's his transmission anchoring from it's maybe a little bit more the staring the abyss and and and surviving it then then calling out coordinates from the mountaintop the most important thing from me quite apart from his work with these stories modernist was as you say his investigation into the Bible and I've always been fascinated although I'm an atheist I'm always been fascinated by the power of the biblical stories I often found myself looking at these huge cathedrals and churches that sprouted up all over Europe you know and and asked myself well what's that about you know why was this story so powerful I mean yeah it's the defense against death if you want to be cynical but hey you know it could be lots of other stories you know why is this one so unbelievably powerful and what does it mean for it to be so powerful and pieces I think brilliantly answers that question in the biblical lectures he's done and he really changed me those lectures who genuinely did I think changed the way I lived my life because he came to this very very important conclusion which I'm pretty convinced by I don't think I'm ever 100% convinced about anything but I'm very convinced by his idea as I've someone who's suffered depression and depression is like a crisis of meaning in your the worst thing about depression is not about being miserable being having a life that seems utterly meaningless and that's why it's such torment and Petersons in a way tries to answer the question how do we as an individual that's a bit of a paradox how do i as an individual acquire meaning because meaning is the most important thing any of us could have you know there's meaning as it you know if you don't know and yet no one can quite say what meaning is which i think is interesting in itself you know one says well I want a sense of meaning what is a sense of me what is meaning and Peterson I think it knowledge is that mystery but also it says well you know if you want a sense of meaning it's not about just doing what you want it's not about just following your bliss as Joseph Campbell would be or having a much fun as possible or or even necessarily being happy no absolutely no not necessarily being happy it's there were more important things than being happy and and I've also found that to be true in my life when Adam and Matt invited me to do that podcast we were all someone who similar to the two of you I believe was starting to track Peterson and not just Jordan Peterson and what he was saying but also the ripples he was having a culture the absolute phenomenon and explosion of attention that was happening around him in the media and started kind of watching him reading him with an open mind my experience was an open mind like oh I resonate with that I love always bringing Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and archetypal dimensions to his thinking like how he's kind of kicking the left a little bit and calling them on some of their problematic thinking and then watching this kind of phenomenon from the left or the far left with people just with extraordinary levels of anger and fear and distrust and kind of the the difference in that experience of my own and some of our experiences of Peterson and then watching a lot of friends who are on the far left having radically different experience and perception of who he is and what he's bringing and was really just curious about that and it it seems like similar to some of the stuff you've been doing with rebel wisdom and as a I mean you're training as a psychologist we do a lot of work with with psychology as well when there's a huge reactivity to something there's always something interesting going on behind it and it sort of makes you inquire it's like okay what is what are people reacting to yes whether you love them or hate them it's that equal proportion of intensity and whenever that's there it's what's kind of called a complex complex is a is a psychological and I think young would say it like it can be a autonomous and autonomous complex is it's not part of the ego it's so deep-rooted and it's my opinion it's a collective complex in the collective unconscious it's like everyone on the right thinks everyone on the left is a Stalinist and everyone everyone on the right thinks everyone everyone the left thinks everyone the right is a Nazi and there's this polarization happening where people like like Peterson who are trying to carve out I would say not non-political but a kind of a position that's lateral to politics that's more in the psychological domain to ask people to look at themselves as individuals to question the extent to which they're projecting their shadow on to the other which until we can resolve issues on that level it's gonna be very difficult to resolve these political disagreements and so that's one of the main reasons that I've found myself so interested in what Peterson is saying he's shifting the level of the conversation of trying to at least I was so excited to see Jordan Peterson erupted onto the stage and I know you had particularly part in that there is a culture war that is in bright precedence I mean we are in the middle of a culture war there's a polarization and Jordan Peterson is standing in the middle as a lightning rod taking all the projections from both sides he clearly sees the postmodern ideology and it is an ideology it's a system of beliefs and values that will not lead us to the promised land it is it is problematic it leads us into a swamp with no exit it is not sustainable he sees it very clearly and in my opinion he sees it from a modern perspective very brilliant modern perspective he sees and he has a depth because of his understanding of Carl Jung and his own work in psychology the field of psychology that is deeper than most people so people are drawn to that depth he sees something much deeper then other people are seeing right now we had had we'd never met one another um I knew actually very little about Jordan Peterson has written work he knew pretty little about mine and we were just told sit down and shoot and we had no idea where we were going so he just started talking so why the most Rinna's hemisphere and he just went from there but what I felt was here was you know a super intelligent man who had wide-ranging interests in psychology philosophy and didn't rule out a spiritual angle to things and I don't think that I would an end in the film I in that clip I think he probably comes out that there are aspects of what Jordan was saying that I was getting well yes but so I didn't entirely kind of not a Peter Peter Sounion but I do have a huge respect for him and we had a great conversation and we were proposing to do more what do you make of the sort of the criticisms as often he's described as a fraud or a charlatan in some of the the media coverage but when you watch the interview with yourself I mean that's that's a very high-level conversation the idea of him as a fraud or a charlatan just seems kind of bizarre it's it's outrageous it's it's disrespectful its dismissive and it's entirely typical of blinkered liberalism he you can disagree with him about many things and I would disagree with him about a number of things but to say that is just to show how could you he's clearly an extraordinary man and I never Charlotte what does that mean I think what strikes people is that he was relatively unknown and then he became known but that's what life isn't it doesn't prove for a Sharla's yeah I mean a lot of this sounds quite Jordan Peters and esque what's your attitude Jordan Peterson yeah I mean I I'm glad he's out there and I think there are you know I mean I think at a minimum there's sort of three different jordan Peterson's you know there's Jordan Peterson the analyst and academic which virtually nobody ever heard of there's Jordan Peterson the kind of contrary in public intellectual which sort of you know kicked off in 2016 and then there's sort of Jordan Peterson sort of raw shot and blot for the culture wars of which both left and right wildly distort who he is what he's saying and what it and what it means for them and so we get we get the the second and the third ones completely mixed although the first one you know University of Toronto and hop near former Harvard professors the one that gives the credibility and the weight to the other two dialogues so in that respect I think as I what I imagined him to be as an actual man is a pretty high integrity principled person who likes to think for himself and likes to speak not just truth to power but but also likes to remind his audience whether it's students or broader than that what what is you know what is it what is the life well a good life well lived and now there I think there are there are problems in how in the age of soundbites and hundreds of hours of footage and tons of speaking and those kind of things that become problematic and I'm not in any way convinced that if I sat down with him and said hey mate what about this bit that he would actually stand and defend them but impressions I get would be that his I think he sometimes over catastrophize is the slippery slope to Marxism in the sense of that that all that you know this way lies Stalinist death camps therefore we cannot give one inch on on concessions to progressive idea although having said that I have also personally experienced the almost Chinese Communists like Tom Xing struggle sessions of political correctness in in the Academy and its kind of left-wing you know left coast idea so it's not that I don't see the peril I do I just think sometimes he uses the slippery slope argument maybe I think it pulls it out just sometimes a little early is the bottom line without necessarily enough conditions to justify it he sometimes in my experience I think I remember him on Joe Rogan doing the life is nasty brutish and short the kind of Hobbesian it's always been this way therefore any efforts to try and recalibrate or rebalance the scales are fundamentally flawed delusional and by the way lead to the Stalinist death camps without any more nuanced socio-political critique of practices and policies so for instance concentration of wealth and the 1% and even the percentage of 1% has been directly traceable in at least in the US over you know tax and tax and corporate law various various deliberate policies that are fundamentally different in the 70s and 80s and have now resulted in an incredible skewing an aggregation of wealth in the hands of the few for him to skip over that and go to lobsters and serotonin feels like skipping some critical steps and also skipping some critical places of potential responsibility for me his success signifies how much we're thirsting for this father energy in our culture what do you make of Jordan Peters and what do you make of the Jordan Peterson phenomena you know I think first of all I would not have predicted it so I don't want to I I think maybe I'm often called and among my among my people who agree with me I'm called a visionary and but I was not a visionary and for seeing Jordan Peterson I think it's amazing that an intellectual that is young in who is you know who speaks in terms of often of metaphor and an allegory that he has risen to such extraordinary success and I think it is a reason is in part a result of our enormous hunger we you know we have we've attached to two extremely unlikely figures because it our hunger the Donald Trump on the one hand and Jordan Peterson on the other two ends of the extreme in terms of somebody who's been willing to say you know fathers are important families are important and so Jordan and I found ourselves in in a hour-and-a-half dialogue in which I would give a you know I would talk about fathers and roughhousing and he would talk about some intellectual Piaget or someone else who was you know who was in the literature or in Disney movies or or is something else that related to that and it was just a fascinating hour-and-a-half I I think because you know I'm usually when I'm being interviewed I don't learn a great deal but I certainly learned it was wonderful the way we learned from each other and you'll you're from Canada yeah one of the the the biggest phenomenon of the last couple of years has been Jordan Peterson yeah would it be made of him his rise and what it says about the culture that people are so thirsting for what he's talking about Peterson first was very bright extraordinaire articulate and in some ways a compelling speaker so he said he's an attractive figure in some ways when I read him I sense a lot of suppressed rage in him in fact I think his voice is choking with a rage alot of time it's anything as he talks about rage that you have to deal with it I don't think you'll understand just how angry yet and it's and and if you look at his websites the comments were full of rage by his young acolytes well that's an energetic thing that it's his energy that draws people as much as what he actually teaches secondly he teaches a repression I mean he he very rightly takes an issue where somebody mandates a second language very rightly and righteously since the pie will not be dictated to about what language I'm gonna use but good for him I'm all in favor of not mandating language on the one hand on the other hand he basically advocates repression in his book he talks about how an angry to your child needs to be sit by themselves until they get over it rather than understanding why a child would be angry rage - what frustrations are having and what human contact they need to help them move through that anger he says we press the anger so he's all about repressed anger for example circuit and it's very interesting he talks about children he talks humble little varmints and little monsters and so on I know that's meant to be humorous but it's also certainly you're thinking of the young human child so fundamentally I steam as an agent of repression he posing as an agent of libertarianism not to mention he's got this big in his bonnet about what he considers to be seems to consider to be conspiracies by left-wing intellectuals they seem to be his bete noire being a left-wing intellectual myself I'd like to talk to him so now what were you so upset about Jordan were you so afraid of you know he talks about these bloody Marxists and and any any points are very accurately all the horror that occurred under so-called Marxist regimes particularly in the Soviet Union he's absolutely accurate about that but then he promotes Christianity shall I tell him about the mass murders that occurred in the name of Christianity should I tell him about all the millions that were slaughtered in the names of the gentle Jesus in other words let's be fair about it he seems to pick ideologies to attack and abhor and embrace other ideologies that are just as murderers in practice sometimes it's a much more interesting question for me what happened is how come underneath Arg I was meant to be liberate people so many people were oppressed I come from Eastern Europe I was born in Hungary he doesn't have to tell me about what was like but how about asking how come a religious philosophy that was meant to promote love and acceptance and compassion has become such an agent of 2 million a of repression oppression and and-and-and-and-and killing so can we be objective or we're gonna be simply tribal about it I have a lot to say to Jordan or a lot to as much as I appreciate actually some of what he says and as interesting as I find them I think is a very mixed figure largely an occasion to of repression [Music]
