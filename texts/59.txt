a quote that the guy who put together the intellectual dark website use at the top of one of his pages was when two or three gather in my name I am there with them and it was a biblical quote yeah and I was very struck by that it really fits with what you were saying about there's a sense of something good happening when when these people get together and talk in this way yes I think this is right and I think it's deep which is to say that well let me use maybe Peterson's framework just to make it soft wicker self-reflective it seems to me that there is something that happens when two or more gathered together in my name and oftentimes in history we've needed that something to make it and the situation was not easy the situation was complex challenging and so it required that something that whatever it is that happens when we are gathered together in a space of well collaboration let's just make it again very simple a space of peace a space of mutual understanding not for the purpose of delivering on the same opinion but really for going deep and trying to find something which is trying to frankly express itself like to listen and so if that story the story that I just told is true then it would be in our bones it would be in our deepest mythology and our deepest traditions I do use religion that this is the place to go that when trouble is brewing gather together answer into this space this is where we do these sorts of things this is how we solve these kinds of problems
