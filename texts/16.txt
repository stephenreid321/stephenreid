[Music] over the last month or so been putting out a few films that we shot with ken wilber and the integral philosopher and they've had a lot of views a lot of really interesting comments a little bit of really interesting feedback both in the comments on the videos and also kind of on some of the integral forums and we're recording this because we wanted to kind of talk about why we think that Ken's work is so significant Y the integral work is so significant and also why where we see it fitting into the conversation that's kind of emergent at the moment we talked to John Verve a key about this quite recently and John bhave key also kind of has this sense there's the potential for the integration of a lot of the wisdom traditions of the past with modern science cognitive science in his perspective but also this kind of map that integral talked about a long time ago there could be a sense that this is the time that integral talked about like integral and we're also going to explain a few of the sort of key concepts of integral why we think they're relevant and why we think that they they illustrate or illuminate what's happening at the moment and one of the key points is that integral predicted that there would be a kind of new level of consciousness called integral that would be able to where a lot of the paradoxes of previous levels of consciousness would be resolved and that's sort of the potential for a new synthesis would would come about I think it's worth just even if we rewind all the way to what what is integral because it's quite a complicated philosophy for for anyone looking from the outside he doesn't engage with it but and why does it matter to the conversation we have been covering like how does it relate to the intellectual darkweb phenomena and and everything else we've had on the channel I think if I had to break down in incredibly simple terms I think one of the things that integral is about as a kind of philosophical model is that we as people and as societies never stop developing and growing we keep evolving so it's interesting present in our culture we have no problem recognizing that an 8 year old is different in many ways to an 18 year old just you know we develop but we have this sense that at some point in our early 20s maybe we just stopped developing and we're just an adult then integral points out and not just integral as we're saying so there's lots of different developmental models people like Robert Keegan and many many more a lot of people have put a lot of work into looking at how do we develop over time and I suppose the genius of Ken Wilber and integral is that he made amongst other things a map of maps so he took all not all of them but many many many different developmental models and synthesized them into one meta model I suppose so and why I think that's important is just before we go into the different aspects of it having a framework on the world and what's happening in our culture and why people can't get along with each other and all that the polarity we're seeing having a developmental model as a map the map is not the territory there's probably another thing we should talk about but having that model makes things easier to navigate and understand in my opinion has been certainly for me I think for us in general with the channel it's been quite a useful filter through which to see and understand more about what's going on in the culture right now yeah and it's important as well to sort of just take a step back as well because I think one of the the problems with integral is that because there's a lot of cognitive framework there's the colors there's the different quadrants it can get very the the conversation can become very jargon heavy very quickly and it can become a very inside baseball kind of conversation as you'll see if you go to any of the integral sites and so but this but this developmental piece the idea that how we think is as important as what we're thinking which is also at John for a key is also talking about quite a lot which is really interesting with cognitive science is at least as because it actually frames what we think far more than we realize and that that an our sense is that that developmental piece is a key ingredient in the evolving conversation that the intellectual dark web is a part of we're a part of this sense that people have where the conversation is going somewhere there is a need for a developmental the developmental piece is such a key part of that and integral ease is is probably the best-known school that deals with the developmental model but it's not the only one and it's also for example Jean Piaget who was Jordan Pederson talks about as a key influencer looked at kind of how children develop as a but also his ultimate aim was to unite science and ethics religion morality and was able to do that in a way of kind of looking at how we develop so I think it's important to put the sort of flag there and say that it's not just about integral and also I think what we're interested in doing and I've seen a few people reflect on this on online it's like is now a good time to look at the legacy of integral like what it's what it's done really well what it's done less less well and I think so and I think that's something that we're interested in looking at we've got an interview with Jamie wheel coming up who's one of our kind of real who's been a star of the channel for quite a while and also has a real history with integrity was part of kind of the integral movement from quite a while ago so just going to play a clip from him that we've got in the the film that's coming up it seems to be the case as we move into these you know nominally transpersonal communities is that all of these thought leaders who have been breaking trail right there but they brought they brought through something profound something unique something useful they're bringing a tool to our shared collective and by default and/or by design we're all wounded healers we all need the thing that we've built more than anybody else needs it and I think that that same case is probably true for Ken and rather than having the people who have experienced and benefited from integral theory then rise up in some sort of unreconciled slay the father angry child dynamic can there be instead the sense of hey wow your life's work has lit things up in me has helped guide my path right has brought me to places I never had imagined and perhaps can we then turn around and give back the wounded healer the realized gift that they offered in the first place and not needs to not no need to knock them down off pedestals and no need to kind of reclaim our gold and kind of Angry and dysfunctional ways but to say thank you so much and let us return the favor let us return academic acknowledgment let us return community let us return love appreciation affection and challenge let us show up as the humans you've been writing about all along and let's help you take that final step for yourself we don't all need all of our teachers to be Moses leading people to the promised land and getting stuck on the edge we can actually welcome the folks that helped guide us to that land to to the party itself so the connection with Ken came out quite synchronistically because we wrote a piece on the intellectual dark web as an emerging integral conversation and it became kind of one of the most read articles that I've put on medium and in that so they're about halfway down I talked about how the integral framework was really useful to look at what was going on and how the intellectual dark web could be seen as an emerging integral conversation and can read that and also read a piece in that where I think I said okay we're going to try and summarize integral theory in three paragraphs and you actually wrote that piece and he said he read that like someone's gonna summarize integral theory and three paragraphs was like I'd like to see you try and actually was quite impressed that it was a pretty good job of interpreting integral Theory in a very short space of time so he got in touch with us or Ken's people got in touch with us and suggested an interview and the interview was like a four and a half hour epic which if you want to see in full you can see by becoming a subscriber and then we turned it into three documentaries the Jordan Peterson Jon and Peterson and the evolution of thought which is the central one that's had about 80,000 views then another one called the intellectual dark web an integral conversation and then another one Jordan peace and Sam Harris how integral Theory can illustrate their different conceptions of truth I think that points to another useful aspect of integral is that it has a it provides a map of reality again it's a map of the territory and they're to put it very very simply it's kind of a four quadrant model but it divides into the kind of inner experience and the outer experience we can have so my inner experience of being me and the subjective reality of that has its own language and a way of inquiring into that and studying that and our shared understanding of the outside world that has its own language of the language of science of you know measurement and those are great those it's it's always yes and with integral those two aspects of reality they're not mutually exclusive they're both happening at the same time and when for example with Jordan peterson and sam harris they were talking from those two different quadrants in this model so that in integral that can't work because there's different language it's a different kind of order of thinking required and you can't collapse one truth claim into the other truth claim so science does not and that's often what happens with science where they just don't accept the the reality of the interior experience yes yeah exactly so that's that's a key you know that's an example of where this model can be used to have a better understanding of you know in particular why can't people agree on something I find that very interesting thing especially in a very polarized environment it's easier for us to agree on things that we can parse out go okay well this is an internal experience I'm trying to apply it to something else that's not going to work I just have to really put it's holding lots of different things in your mind and in your awareness at the same time so so Jordan Pederson famously kind of is always going on about post-modernism and that the kind of pathologies of post-modernism what's really interesting is that Ken Wilber actually diagnose what he called Boomer itis back a couple of decades ago and and at the time so so Ken's conception of where that goes wrong I think is much more sophisticated than Jordan Peterson's I think Jordan Peterson can become quite one-dimensional when he talks about post-modernism and he doesn't seem to appreciate or at least doesn't speak to the value of post-modernism that actually there was a stage where it was quite there is some use in it there is a pathology about it when it dissolves into relativism and to kind of the associated narcissism that that Ken talks about that Ken also can just diagnose a long time ago like that this particular way of looking at the world that he called green kind of multi perspectival respecting sort of different perspectives had the potential to go bad there he called boomer itis and diagnose that that would mean that it would effectively collapse into if this sort of paradox of no no truth claim is is kind of canonical becomes all truth claims are equally valid and then eventually you just collapse into this kind of morass of relativism and what's really interesting is that a lot of people at the time when Ken was saying this was sort of saying while he's going over the D he's going off the deep end it's not gonna be that bad now it's quite clear like the pathology of Greene the pathology of post-modernism is so rampant that a lot of people are now saying whoa he was he was very prescient he actually spotted it a long time ago and and has been borne out by what's been happening in the culture since I think it's week that's the really nice example because it applies to where we might be going I think with any developmental model is very useful because if you look at when green the this kind of pluralistic relativistic how it arose it arose against the context of like the 1950s and everything had to come before that and just I think it's often good to put oneself back in that world where there was segregation where there was very rigid thought structures whether you know that was an incredibly cutting edge inspiring you know civil rights comes out of it art starts to change there's a freeing of sexual mores and there's people are experimenting with their consciousness like that is a natural developmental it's like a teenager getting finally being free from a really stifling home it's a natural developmental thing and yes it went sour for sure but what's interesting for me is that you can look at that in context it adds a certain understanding and compassion which i think is needed for us ever any of us ever getting into a proper dialogue where something new can emerge instead of being in our kind of ideological camps in the same way i wouldn't be rate an eight-year-old for not being particularly good at drawing a square because they're an eight-year-old you know and so we all as human beings and as cultures go through processes and then the question is okay where are we going now how can we use that to kind of understand what's happening right now and where we might be going in a sense we never know where we're going you don't know what the next this is you never know where the next stages you don't but at the same time there is a sense I think from a lot of people who are following our content and we're in dialogue with that there is a sense of there's a teleology to this conversation as a tote there is a sense that a lot of people have it is going somewhere yes the it came from the like we saw the the kind of eruption and the the phenomenon of Jordan Peterson we've seen a real kind of intellectual awakening online the intellectual dark web is one manifestation of that the kind of this bottom-up sense making process coming out and I mean my sense of where it's going also John bhave key pretty much confirmed that in a recent interview is a conscious reintegration of of the wisdom traditions and and a the potential for a grand synthesis which I think a lot of us are really sensing it's like okay there's a real sense of that coming and also what we really found was like Ken Wilber is a really important voice to be part of this conversation and that was ultimately our aim with doing the interview with him is to bring him into this conversation and I think I mean we'll we'll see where it goes from here but the interesting thing as well is that it's it's now a very networked decentralized two-way process and I think that's very different from how it probably was back in the days when integrals first arising it's also interesting a lot of the a lot of our sort of most dedicated followers and a lot of our subscribers as well are also have a history with integral there's a sense of that there is it's very attractive to people who are trying to make sense of the world in terms of big picture big patterns and they I think they also recognize that's what we're trying to do with with rebel wisdom is to create a sense making enterprise and to try and put see okay how does this fit so for example Jamie wheel is a good example it's like Jamie wheel for me is holding a really crucial piece around flows but flow states embodied wisdom transformational stuff which is as far as I can see kind of he's holding that particular piece in the constellation and the yeah the constellation that we're aware of and different people are holding different places but I think what's interesting now is that it's a much more two-way conversation and I I wonder I think Ken and the people around him I would invite them to enter that conversation more in a two-way process and I'm not sure that that's something that integral has had before in that same way yeah and I think I think it's a key point because you know we've talked a lot we've we've had people Jorden Greenhalgh Daniel schmackdown burger on the channel talking about the importance of this decentralized collective intelligence as an antidote to the collapse of the institutions that aren't really working right now in our society we need to decentralize and get into this mode where something new emerges through the interaction between us and implicit in that is this level of openness and this level of not quite knowing the answer and feeding back to one another and this is what we're trying to do it the rebel ISM summit as well it's this kind of process and to really land that yeah it's shifting for as Jordan Greenhalgh it's shifting from this broadcast modality to a more networked collective modality and that has to happen as individuals as individuals we can get stuck in a broadcast mode and we're just broadcasting to each other rather than trying to make sense together and I think that's the next process that's what needs to happen yeah and just something else that just comes up in terms of why people have traditionally been very interested in integral is that it's also a map or a model that allows for what we were just talking about allows for those other states to come in you know that kind of getting into this liminal space and for spiritual experience and mystical experiences to be contextualized in quite largely quite a useful way whereas the opposite of that is someone has these experiences or gets into these states and the only Avenue is some kind of New Age cranker II that tries to interpret it you know that's what I've one of the things I found very useful about integral you know understanding how to deal with a shadow understanding how to you know the relationship between states we can get into like the flow state and how we then interpret the world you know we interpret that state or whatever stage we're at so there's lots of very useful stuff in there that allows for a kind of maybe a more mature understanding of the metaphysical let's say so yeah we're really interested in exploring the legacy of integral and the first person I thought to call was Jamie wheel because Jamie Jamie I knew had a big history with integral going back quite a long time and is also kind of one of the most impressive thinkers that we've interviewed in the time that we've been doing the channel if you haven't watched his piece stealing fire from the gods then you should because it's amazing and he he had quite a lot of appreciation but also quite a few criticisms of integral and I think it's it's it's got to be done I think it's time for if we're going to do this properly we need to to bring that level of kind of transparency and honesty to this is what integral did really well this is what integral didn't do so well and and so that's what that's the kind of conversation that we were interested in in hosting is is both sides of the coin yeah something Jamie said as well is that there's a lot of people walking around running integral OS like an operating system you know I'd class myself as one of those people and I think that that there's a necessary distinction between integral OS and when integral becomes the only map someone is using for example you know that one of the difficulties in integral communities is that this that those very complex things levels of you know different models are spiral dynamics there's all these different things they can a be kind of hijacked by the ego so we can hide in them in a sense and be they can create shadows of their own because it's very common for people to kind of accuse each other of being not integral you know this happens quite a lot and that's something that's a very first tier thing to say yeah this is something I think needs to be I think a lot of people in the integral communities are aware of it I think it seems to be out and explicit and explored this is it yeah if you spend any time on any integral forum you'll see that kind of integral one-upmanship yes like I'm more second tier than you and so that I mean there is a difficulty and a danger within all of these developmental Maps like I think we need to recover hierarchy like we have sort of one of the insights of integral is that we've had a green postmodern consciousness it's obliterated all hierarchies and so we're in flat land and we can't navigate because we don't know what up is but at the same time implicit in any hierarchies is it's a dangerous business because you're automatically in some sense creating this diet this dynamic of I'm more developed than you it's very it's very that it's a very difficult space to navigate yeah the irony is that it's that whole model of saying yes and going to the next stage and then like Russian dolls kind of growing more and more integrated is is based mainly on empathy for the pre you know that and and there's not I have not seen a huge amount of empathy sometimes in a lot of the integral communities you know and yeah like we were talking before about you know the movement from the 1950s so this kind of green pluralistic modality i think jeff salesman pointed out that a lot of people missed out who were born after that missed out on the traditional values so that's a good example of it you don't say oh now screw that like we you know to screw the nineteen fifty we were wrong we're gonna go into another thing it's yes there's truth in that and let's integrate that where's my own traditionalism where's my own morality that maps more to that hold it integrate it have it as part of myself and also have the pluralistic side as part of myself and all the other bits and pieces all of that relies on empathy and openness genuine empathy and openness and if it can't like that that's place to start I think and I think that's where I'd like to see the conversation go as well and for all of us who are interested in this to ask hard questions of ourselves am I really am I really coming from a place of openness or am i coming from a place of you know like that word you mentioned one-upsmanship so yeah the Jamie wheel piece about the legacy of integral is going out pretty much at the same time as this or very shortly afterwards and yeah we're gonna we're gonna see I'm interested in doing maybe another couple of interviews about the legacy of integral people who might have something really worthwhile to talk about kind of developmental thinking why it's useful where it can go wrong kind of the lessons that we can learn from the past and for example Robert Keegan is a very well-known Harvard developmental psychologist who hopefully will govern interview with coming up at the end of April and yeah they're interested in sort of seeing where this conversation is going and the developmental piece being just something absolutely crucial to bring in so just some quick updates to close we had the Revel wisdom summit coming up on the 12th of May which is a one-day event with Jordan Greenhalgh Ian McGilchrist brett Weinstein and Heather huiying and so very excited about that and thank you to everyone who's coming it's sold out now is gonna be about 150 people and the first of what we hope will be many spaces where we can get into this kind of collaborative conversation where we practice really seeing we can let something emerge between us that's more than the sum of our parts so as well as that separately we have finally after many months set up the rebel wisdom store so if anyone likes the t-shirts that we sometimes wear in the videos and just would like teach or even we even have baby onesies and all sorts so I will put that a link to that in the show notes and membership so you put a load more content on for subscribers we've got a couple of really great pieces with Jeffrey Miller and Diana Fleischman including the Polly professors which polyamorous professors I should say which is going to be which is still in it remember exclusive or a little bit longer it will go on the main channel but remember exclusive you want to see it early and an amazing piece with Jeffrey called the neurodiversity case for free speech which i think is one of the best arguments I've heard for a long time and what else we got on they've got the whole four and a half hour Ken Wilber interview and we have yeah a really excellent extra piece with Jon Vevey key on flow States and psychedelics so if you want to see those go and become a subscriber and also yeah if you subscribe at high enough level you can also join the regular zoom calls that we do with other people in the community and that is becoming increasingly yeah a good source of kind of collaborative sense making between everyone who's on those calls so yeah come and join the community see you soon [Music] you [Music]
